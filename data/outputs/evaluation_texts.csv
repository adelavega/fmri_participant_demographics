# Title

The Brain Effects of Laser Acupuncture in Healthy Individuals: An fMRI Investigation

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
As laser acupuncture is being increasingly used to treat mental disorders, we sought to determine whether it has a biologically plausible effect by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the cerebral activation patterns from laser stimulation of relevant acupoints. 


## Methodology/Principal Findings 
  
Ten healthy subjects were randomly stimulated with a fibreoptic infrared laser on 4 acupoints (LR14, CV14, LR8 and HT7) used for depression following the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and 1 control non-acupoint (sham point) in a blocked design (alternating verum laser and placebo laser/rest blocks), while the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI response was recorded from the whole brain on a 3T scanner. Many of the acupoint laser stimulation conditions resulted in different patterns of neural activity. Regions with significantly increased activation included the limbic cortex (cingulate) and the frontal lobe (middle and superior frontal gyrus). Laser acupuncture tended to be associated with ipsilateral brain activation and contralateral deactivation that therefore cannot be simply attributed to somatosensory stimulation. 


## Conclusions/Significance 
  
We found that laser stimulation of acupoints lead to activation of frontal-limbic-striatal brain regions, with the pattern of neural activity somewhat different for each acupuncture point. This is the first study to investigate laser acupuncture on a group of acupoints useful in the management of depression. Differing activity patterns depending on the acupoint site were demonstrated, suggesting that neurological effects vary with the site of stimulation. The mechanisms of activation and deactivation and their effects on depression warrant further investigation.

## Introduction 
  
Despite the remarkable developments in Western Medicine in modern times, public interest in Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (TCAM), such as acupuncture, remains high  ,  . This may be because TCAM is perceived as holistic and relatively free of adverse effects. However, these treatments sit uncomfortably alongside scientific medicine because of strikingly different explanatory systems and the empirical tests applied by each discipline. In order to bridge the gulf between high public acceptability and the lack of empirical evidence for many of these treatments, it is important to reconcile them with modern scientific concepts. Our focus here is on laser acupuncture, and we address the question whether laser acupuncture produces brain effects that are biologically plausible. 

There have been many studies  –  some of which have involved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) of the brain effects of needle acupuncture. Some neuroimaging and neuroendocrine studies have suggested that needle acupuncture affects hypothalamic as well as extrahypothalamic functions and modulates mood  ,  – . Needling of the leg acupoint ST36 and the hand acupoint LI4 was shown to activate the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens and deactivate the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC)  . Superficial needling (i.e. needling that did not produce the classical   de qi   sensation - tingling, numbness or other sensations that occur after an acupuncture needle has been properly placed in the body) and non-acupoints (i.e. points on the skin that do not lie on recognized meridians in Traditional Chinese Medicine [TCM]) did not activate the hypothalamus  . Stimulation of the acupoint PC6, located above the wrist, recommended for a wide range of conditions from nausea to stress management, resulted in activation of the cerebellum, dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus  . All of these studies have used needle acupuncture which, although more traditional, is invasive. 

While laser acupuncture has become an increasingly common clinical method, particularly in primary care, its empirical basis has been less well studied to date. Whereas needle acupuncture studies have shown activation and deactivation of the somatosensory cortex  ,  ,  ,  ,  – , superficial needling and laser intervention appear to stimulate cortical and subcortical structures other than the somatosensory cortex  ,  ,  . This is consistent with the observation that low intensity laser stimulation does not produce a skin sensation. For example, laser acupuncture of a foot acupoint, classically used for treating visual problems, was demonstrated to cause activation of the occipital cortex  . 

This study has used laser delivered at low intensity as used in primary care. Other studies have reported high intensity lasers can produce de qi sensation  . High intensity laser is not commonly used in primary care situations and therefore was not used in the current study. Further, as low intensity laser does not result in sensory sensation it is ideal for double blind randomized controlled studies where the subjects could not differentiate between placebo (laser off) and verum laser (laser on). 

The evidence suggests that cortical activation does occur with acupuncture and this activation may be specific to certain brain regions in relation to the site and type of stimulation  – . In practice, acupoint efficacy is not specific, and one acupoint can be used for several different conditions, just as one medical condition can be managed with several acupoint locations. For instance, the antidepressant effect of laser acupuncture   has been attributed to a group of acupoints - CV14, LR14, LR8 and HT7 (see   for anatomical location), however there are other acupoint combinations that are also applicable for the management of depression. The neurological effects of stimulation of these acupoints CV14, LR14, HT7 and LR8 in combination have yet to be investigated. 

In this study, we examined the blood oxygen level dependant (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to laser simulation on the above mentioned acupoints CV14, LR14, LR8 and HT7. We chose laser acupuncture as it permits blinding of application because of the lack of a local sensation at low intensity, together with the previously mentioned increases in practical usage and limited understanding of its mechanisms. We reasoned that if laser acupuncture is altering a person's mental state a neurological effect should be observable. Further, if the effect differs dependent on the site of stimulation, then the neural locus of the activity should also differ. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Ethics Statement 
  
The study was approved by the human research ethics committee of the South Eastern Sydney & Illawarra Area Health Service and participants provided written informed consent before participation. 


### Participants 
  
The participants (n = 10) (7 women, 3 men) were healthy volunteers aged 18–50 years (mean age  = 39.8 years) who were recruited by advertisement from the staff and students of the University of New South Wales and Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia. All participants were right-handed and had no past history of depression or other psychiatric disorder, a Beck Depression Inventory   score <10, no history of drug or alcohol abuse, no medication intake within 3 months of the study, and no neurological or systemic disorders. Eight were acupuncture naïve and two had had needle acupuncture more than 3 months previously and did not know what to expect from laser intervention. Any contra-indications to MRI (pacemaker, ferromagnetic implants or foreign body, claustrophobia) were exclusionary. 


### Choice of acupoints and control point 
  
The acupoints were selected based on results from our previous study   and the TCM for mood disorders  ,  . These acupoints lay on the classically named liver (LR), heart (HT) and conception vessel (CV) meridians. The selected points, labelled LR8, LR14, HT7 and CV14 in TCM, are shown in  . LR8 is in the medial knee region, between the insertions of the sartorius and semitendinosus muscles. LR14 is in the vicinity of the 6th intercostal space on the mid clavicular line. HT7 is at the wrist crease, in the vicinity of the radial side of the flexor carpi ulnaris. CV14 is in the anterior midline, approximately 5 cm below the xiphisternum. A control non-acupoint was selected on the abdominal surface, midway between SP15 (four cun from the umbilicus) and ST25 (two cun from the umbilicus) away from the abdominal meridians. 
   Selected acupoints relevant to mood and depression.  
In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Liver (LR) meridian is used to treat depression. Two LR points were used: LR14 and LR 8. Two other acupoints considered important in depression were also used (CV 14 and HT 7). The control point (sham point or non acupoint) was located midway between SP15 and ST 25 acupoints. 
  

### fMRI design 
  
A block design was used, with each block of 20 seconds duration during which the subject received either laser stimulation (switched ‘on’) or placebo stimulation (switched ‘off’) at one acupoint. The infra red laser was held with light touch on the skin surface by the acupuncturist. Since the laser produces no sensation, the subject was able to be kept blind to the phase of stimulation. The on-off cycle was repeated 4 times for each acupoint (LR14, LR8, CV14, HT7), with the 4 acupoints being stimulated twice in random order. The control point near ST25 was stimulated once per subject. The block design accomodated for the placebo (laser off) condition during its rest phases. In total there were nine runs per subject. The subject was told to relax and keep his/her eyes closed during the entire time in the scanner. 


### Laser stimulation 
  
A Moxla  prototype fiberoptic infra-red light laser (808 nm) with 25 mW capacity and a fiber optic arm was developed for usage in the scanning room. The laser parameters are similar to the one used in the clinical study we have based our investigation upon  . The acupoints were marked with a skin marking pencil prior to entry into the scanning room. A stably held laser was applied to the skin by the acupuncturist (IQ-S) who moved it from point to point according to the time signal. The switching on and off was achieved with a computer signal time-locked to the MRI acquisition. 


### fMRI 
  
Imaging was performed on a 3T Philips Intera MRI scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) for both T1-weighted 3D structural and BOLD contrast functional MRI. The 3D structural MRI was acquired in sagittal orientation using a T1-weighted TFE sequence (TR/TE  = 6.39/2.9 ms; flip angle  = 8; matrix size  = 256×256; FOV  = 256×256 mm; slice thickness 1.0 mm), yielding sagittal slices of 1.0 mm thick and an in-plane spatial resolution of 1.0×1.0 mm, producing an isotropic voxel of 1.0×1.0×1.0 mm. A gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) technique (TR/TE = 2000/40 ms; matrix size  = 128×128; FOV = 250×250 mm; in plane pixel size 1.953×1.953 mm) was used to acquire T2-weighted BOLD contrast fMRI in axial orientation. The whole brain was covered using 21 slices at 5.0 mm slice thickness and 0.5 mm gap for each volume. Each session of 96 volumes were collected with the rate of 2s/volume. 


### Image preprocessing and statistical analysis 
  
Imaging data were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM2, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) implemented in Matlab version 6 (The Mathworks Inc., USA). All volumes were realigned spatially to the first volume and the time-series for voxels within each slice realigned temporally to acquisition of the middle slice. Resulting volumes were normalized to a standard EPI template based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). The normalized images were smoothed with an isotropic 8 mm full-width half-maximal Gaussian kernel. The time-series in each voxel were highpass-filtered to 1/120 Hz to remove low-frequency noise. 

Statistical analysis was performed in two stages, assuming a random effects design. Each stimulation site was compared to the placebo (laser off) condition for first level analysis. The BOLD response to the laser acupuncture stimulation was modeled by a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). The second level analysis (ANOVA) used each individual subject's contrast images, which were effectively the statistical parametric maps of the t-statistics for each voxel. The data had a threshold of p <0.001 with a spatial extent of 15 contiguous voxels. 


### Post-imaging Assessment 
  
After the scanning session, subjects rated selected items on the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory   to describe their mental state during the period of the scanning. The ratings were: 1 (not at all), 2 (somewhat), 3 (moderately so) and 4 (very much so). 



## Results 
  
### Group analysis 
  
At the group level, there were significant increases (activation) in BOLD levels in some brain regions for acupoints LR14, CV14, LR8 and the control point compared to all the other points (verum laser per point > all others, p<0.001; see  ). Further, there were significant decreases (deactivation) in BOLD levels for acupoints LR14, LR8 and the control point compared to all the other points (all others > verum laser per point, p<0.001; see  ) in other brain regions. 
   Significant brain activation patterns from laser acupuncture to LR14, CV14, LR8 and control point.      
With LR8, activation of ipsilateral limbic cortex (cingulate gyrus) and deactivation of bilateral frontal cortices (middle frontal gyrus), (contralateral superior frontal gyrus), contralateral temporal cortex (middle temporal gyrus) and contralateral caudate occurred. Stimulation at the LR14 acupoint resulted in activation of contralateral frontal cortex (superior and middle frontal gyrii), contralateral parietal cortex (postcentral gyrus) and deactivation of contralateral cerebellum (cerebellar tonsil) and contralateral occipital cortex (precuneus). Acupoint CV14 produced activation of the left limbic cortex in the posterior cingulate and there was no significant deactivation in the grey matter. HT7 had no significant activation or deactivation. The control point (non acupoint or sham point), activated the contralateral parietal cortex (postcentral gyrus). It also deactivated the contralateral limbic cortex (parahippocampal gyrus). 


### Somatosensory cortex and laterality of cerebral activation and deactivation 
  
Our study involved randomized stimulation of the 4 acupoints and a control point. Although there was activation of contralateral postcentral gyrus (primary somatosensory cortex or SSI) with LR14 and control point, none of the other acupoints showed any activation of the somatosensory cortex. The cortical and subcortical structures activated with stimulation of the limb acupoints tended to be largely ipsilateral to the side of stimulation. 

All the acupoints and control point did not have deactivation at the somatosensory cortex. However they all had contralateral deactivations with the exception of LR8 that had bilateral middle frontal gyrus deactivation. 


### Behavioral observations 
  
Participants did not describe anxiety or discomfort during scanning, except for one who found the headphones uncomfortable. The mean Spielberger scale ratings were on select items were: feeling calm (3.3), secure (3.3), relaxed (3.3), nervous (1.4), jittery (1.1), worried (1.1) or overexcited and rattled (1.1). 



## Discussion 
  
This is the first fMRI study to examine the effects of laser stimulation of a suite of acupoints found to be efficacious in a clinical condition (depression). A salient feature of this study was that four acupoints and a control non-acupoint (sham point) were stimulated in a random design. The subjects were unaware of the relative significance of different acupoints. The use of low level laser acupuncture, which does not produce a skin sensation, permitted the blinding of subjects to verum or placebo stimulation, something difficult to achieve with needle acupuncture. 

The main finding of our study was that each acupoint or control point resulted in a different pattern of brain activity when contrasted against all the other acupoints or control point. The acupoints we investigated in this study were those that have been used in our previous treatment study for depression  . This finding suggests that although these acupoints are all used in the treatment of depression, the neural locus of this effect differs depending upon the site stimulated. The efficacy of these acupoints in the treatment of depression may vary greatly between patients and site stimulated, and our findings may shed some light on these effects  . 

The neuroanatomical basis of depression is not completely understood, however a number of studies have implicated abnormalities in certain brain regions, in particular the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the cingulate gyrus and the so-called limbic brain regions (hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, septal nuclei, insula, thalamus) and paralimbic regions (orbitofrontal cortex, anterior temporal lobe)  – . There is converging evidence from drug treatment, cognitive-behavior therapy and brain stimulation techniques that antidepressant treatments work by modulating frontal-subcortical neuronal circuits. The most consistently reported finding is that antidepressant treatments lead to a normalization of activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with additional changes in the subgenual cingulate region, the posterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus and insula  . Whether the change in prefrontal cortex is a primary event or secondary to changes in subcortical nuclei is unclear, but the relationship of treatment response to this suggests that it is biologically plausible that laser acupuncture could be an effective antidepressant treatment through its effects on the above brain regions. 

The results show this combination of acupoints activating frontal cortex, limbic cortex and subcortical caudate. The trend is for ipsilateral activation suggestive of neurological circuitry outside the dorsal spinal columns and more likely to be autonomically driven  – . Most of the deactivations were contralateral. Also LR14 and control point activations included primary somatosensory cortical activations (SSI). None of the deactivations involved SSI, however they did include the regions as described earlier that could collectively be called the affective cortex (the frontal, limbic and temporal cortices as well as the subcortical caudate). This combination of ipsilateral and contralateral activations and deactivations may perhaps be representative of the combined actions of both the spinal and autonomic nervous systems during laser acupuncture. 

In classical acupuncture, there are primary and secondary acupoints for the treatment of any disorder. The approach to acupoint selection can be variable, with primary acupoints being considered essential and secondary acupoints additive for some patients. In our study, we cannot predict from these results whether any acupoint should be preferred over others for clinical use, even though LR8 deactivated more brain regions (middle and superior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and the subcortical caudate) than all the other points. These are results from a sample of healthy subjects. The question of whether the results would be different in a sample of clinically depressed subjects, needs to still be answered. Further studies are required to explore the relative value of different acupoints, the final test for which naturally lies in a clinical trial. It also cannot be stated from our study whether the treatment response can be achieved with stimulation at one point alone, or if multiple points are necessary. 

There is conflicting evidence regarding acupoint specificity and whether that specificity is relative rather than absolute for any particular disorder  – . Furthermore, it is debatable whether the clinical effects of acupuncture are restricted to stimulation on points that lie on the classical meridians in TCM. Our finding that laser stimulation of a non-acupoint produced some brain activation suggest that there is unlikely to be a completely neutral control non-acupoint, and this should prompt a re-examination of the use of sham points (in needle acupuncture studies) as control hence minimizing the true statistical effects of any acupoint  – . It is also interesting that laser acupuncture in this study appeared to preferentially activate the limbic cortex ipsilaterally and deactivate the limbic cortex contralaterally. It has been suggested that laser stimulation preferentially activates unmyelinated afferent fibers that project ipsilaterally to the insula  – , which might also explain the differences from needle acupuncture. 

This laser acupuncture fMRI study demonstrated the central effects of stimulation of a suite of acupoints found to be efficacious in treating depression in a primary care setting. The multiple acupoints each activated different groupings of frontal-limbic-striatal brain regions, suggesting some acupoint specificity but also a commonality in the regions affected. There was a trend for the limb acupoints to cause ipsilateral activation and contralateral de-activation. The results of the study suggest that laser acupuncture is a biologically plausible anti-depressant treatment. Its efficacy and the relative merits of the different proposed acupoints must be empirically examined.

# Title

Imaging the functional connectivity of the Periaqueductal Gray during genuine and sham electroacupuncture treatment

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
Electroacupuncture (EA) is currently one of the most popular acupuncture modalities. However, the continuous stimulation characteristic of EA treatment presents challenges to the use of conventional functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) approaches for the investigation of neural mechanisms mediating treatment response because of the requirement for brief and intermittent stimuli in event related or block designed task paradigms. A relatively new analysis method, functional connectivity fMRI (fcMRI), has great potential for studying continuous treatment modalities such as EA. In a previous study, we found that, compared with sham acupuncture, EA can significantly reduce Periaqueductal Gray (PAG) activity when subsequently evoked by experimental pain. Given the PAG's important role in mediating acupuncture analgesia, in this study we investigated functional connectivity with the area of the PAG we previously identified and how that connectivity was affected by genuine and sham EA. 


## Results 
  
Forty-eight subjects, who were randomly assigned to receive either genuine or sham EA paired with either a high or low expectancy manipulation, completed the study. Direct comparison of each treatment mode's functional connectivity revealed: significantly greater connectivity between the PAG, left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and precuneus for the contrast of genuine minus sham; significantly greater connectivity between the PAG and right anterior insula for the contrast of sham minus genuine; no significant differences in connectivity between different contrasts of the two expectancy levels. 


## Conclusions 
  
Our findings indicate the intrinsic functional connectivity changes among key brain regions in the pain matrix and default mode network during genuine EA compared with sham EA. We speculate that continuous genuine EA stimulation can modify the coupling of spontaneous activity in brain regions that play a role in modulating pain perception.

## Background 
  
Acupuncture has been used to alleviate pain for thousands of years. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and many meta-analyses have concluded that acupuncture effectively relieves clinical pain for disorders such as knee osteoarthritis [ ], migraine [ ] and chronic low back pain [ - ]. For instance, three recent large trials found that acupuncture is statistically, clinically [ - ], and cost-effectively [ - ] superior to either optimal guidelines-based conventional therapy, or waitlist controls for chronic low back pain. However, the lack of a significant clinical difference between genuine or sham (placebo) acupuncture has raised skepticism and limited acupuncture's acceptance. 

In parallel, brain imaging tools such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) have been used to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying acupuncture needle stimulation [ - ]} and acupuncture treatment effects [ , - ]. The goal of these studies is to elucidate the changes in neural activity in brain networks associated with acupuncture needle stimulation and to link them to the therapeutic effects of treatment. The block- and event-related paradigms often used in fMRI studies, while well suited to studying the effects of brief intermittent acupuncture needle stimuli, are not suitable for studying some modes of clinical acupuncture treatment. For instance, one of the most important acupuncture treatment modalities, electroacupuncture (EA), is typically administered with continual stimulation for twenty minutes or more. Elucidating the neural substrates of long-duration EA stimulation requires a new approach. 

Recently, functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) has attracted the attention of brain imaging investigators [ - ]. This technique provides a potential fMRI approach appropriate for the study of EA. Based on the premise that low-frequency components of the spontaneous MR imaging signal can provide information about the intrinsic functional and anatomical organization of the brain [ , ], fcMRI investigates the connectivity between all brain regions and a specifically defined ""seed"", or region of interest (ROI). Recent findings using fcMRI have significantly enhanced our understanding of the intrinsic functional and anatomical connections of the brain, including those that underlie pain perception [ ] and modulation [ , ], and pathological changes in these connections that are associated with chronic pain in patients [ - ]. Recently, investigators have also reported functional connectivity changes within the default mode network [ , ], sensorimotor networks [ ], and amygdala-associated brain networks [ , ] after acupuncture needle stimulation, suggesting that this approach is sufficiently sensitive to detect neural modulation associated with acupuncture treatment. 

Therefore, in this new analysis of previously unpublished data collected in a randomized placebo-controlled study [ , ], we investigated the functional connectivity of PAG changes during EA stimulation and sham EA stimulation at acupoints Large Intestine 3 and 4 (LI3 and LI4) on the right hand. The PAG was chosen for analysis because: 1) it is well known that the PAG plays a role in pain modulation [ - ]; 2) PAG has been found to play an important role in acupuncture analgesia [ - ]; and 3) in a previous analysis conducted using this same data set, we found that fMRI signal change to calibrated heat pain was inhibited at the PAG after genuine acupuncture treatment, but was not influenced by level of analgesia expectancy [ ]. 


## Methods 
  
This study utilized a previously collected fMRI dataset investigating brain mechanisms underlying genuine and sham electroacupuncture's analgesic effects. This paper will focus on the fMRI data collected during the acupuncture administration. Results on the treatments' analgesic effects - as measured by changes in subjective pain ratings and in objective brain response - have been published separately [ , ]. Please see the original papers for these results as well as for additional details on experimental procedures not relevant to the present manuscript. 

### Subjects 
  
Seventy-seven healthy, right-handed subjects participated in this study; all subjects were acupuncture naive and had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. As approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital's Institutional Review Board, all subjects provided their written consent to participate. Subjects were then randomized to one of four groups: genuine EA or sham EA paired with either high expectancy (HE) or low expectancy (LE) manipulation. After their participation, subjects were debriefed as to the goals of the experiment and un-blinded to their randomization. 


### Experimental Protocol 
  
This study consisted of two behavioral testing sessions and one fMRI scanning session, each separated by a minimum of three days. The goals of the behavioral sessions were to familiarize subjects with the heat pain rating system and to manipulate their expectations of acupuncture's analgesic effects. In the subsequent fMRI session, the brain networks involved in genuine and sham EA, as well as in HE and LE conditions, were examined. A general overview of the experimental design is presented below. 


### Session 1 
  
This first behavioral session was used to determine appropriate stimulus intensities of heat pain and to familiarize subjects with the pain rating scales. Briefly, temperatures eliciting subjective intensity ratings in the LOW pain range (~5; which indicates weak on the 0-20 Sensory Scale) and HIGH pain range (~15; strong) were selected for each individual using an ascending series of noxious stimuli (increasing by 1°C per stimulus). We then applied a series of 8 noxious stimuli, 4 HIGH pain and 4 LOW pain, presented in random order, and a series of 6 identical HIGH pain noxious stimuli to the right arm. Temperatures were adjusted when necessary to ensure that each subject's subjective ratings of HIGH and LOW remained in the desired range and the final temperature settings were used in the following sessions. 


### Session 2 
  
To prepare subjects for the expectancy manipulation, and in order to establish subjects' expectancy for the duration of the study, subjects were first told that responses to acupuncture can be variable and that a given subject's response tends to remain consistent across sessions. Subjects then viewed a Traditional Chinese Medicine meridian diagram and were falsely told that, according to previous literature, acupuncture could only produce analgesia on the meridian side of the arm. 

Following the preparatory disclaimer, pain stimuli were applied according to the same procedures as session 1. Then, according to their randomization, subjects received either genuine or sham EA. Finally, subjects received post-treatment pain stimuli. Though all subjects were told they were receiving the same pre-treatment heat stimuli so as to test acupuncture's analgesic effect, we actually only followed this protocol on subjects in the LE groups. In the HE groups, we surreptitiously decreased temperatures on the side of the arm subjects were told was the treated meridian in order to elicit reduced pain ratings and give subjects an unmistakable experience of analgesia. (This expectancy manipulation is a modification from previous studies [ , - ].) 


### Session 3 
  
Subjects were told that the procedures from Session 2 would be repeated inside the fMRI scanner. First, fMRI scans were acquired during the pre-treatment application of noxious thermal stimuli. Then, another fMRI scan was acquired during the administration of sham or genuine EA, which provided the data for the functional connectivity analysis described in this manuscript. Lastly, subjects were scanned post-acupuncture treatment while additional heat stimuli were applied. LE groups received the same temperature thermal stimuli as they had before treatment. Although the HE groups were informed that Session 2 procedures would be repeated, only one reduced temperature heat stimuli was administered on the meridian side of the right forearm arm to remind subjects of the analgesia they experienced in Session 2. All other heat stimuli, applied after this ""expectancy boost,"" were delivered at their original temperatures in order to test the treatment effect. In this study, we will focus only on the electro-acupuncture stimulation scan; additional details on the results of the fMRI scans acquired during heat pain application are reported in our previous publications [ , ]. 


### Acupuncture administration 
  
Identical genuine or sham EA was performed by a licensed acupuncturist at acupoints LI3 and LI4 on the right hand during Sessions 2 and 3. LI 3 is located in the depression proximal to the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. LI 4 is located on the dorsum of the hand, between the 1st and 2nd metacarpal bones, in the middle of the 2nd metacarpal bone on the radial side. Both LI 3 and LI 4 can produce analgesic effects according to acupuncture literature [ , ]. 

For genuine EA, needles were inserted into the skin at a depth of about 1.5 cm and adjusted until subjective   deqi   sensations [ ], but no sharp pain, was evoked. Needles were then connected to an EA device passing a 2 Hz current (OMS Medical Supplies IC-1107) [ ], and the intensity was gradually increased to the highest level subjects could tolerate without the sensation of sharp pain. Once the appropriate level of stimulation was achieved for each subject, the level of current was recorded. After calibrating the intensity of the EA stimulation, treatment was applied for approximately 25 minutes. The treatment was further broken down into three 6.5-minute current ON and four 1.5-minute current OFF blocks. An fMRI scan was acquired for 23.5 minutes encompassing the entire treatment (Figure  ).

B) Schematic illustration of the timing during treatment blocks. In total, electroacupuncture (EA) treatment was applied for approximately 25 minutes at a frequency of 2 Hz. Treatment was given in blocks of 6.5-minute current ON and four 1.5-minute current OFF blocks. For sham EA, the sham needle was attached to a de-activated EA device, and no current was applied during the 25 minute treatment. 
  
For sham EA, specially-designed Streitberger sham acupuncture needles were placed on the surface of the skin and connected to a de-activated electroacupuncture device. The Streitberger placebo needle has been validated and used in many studies [ , , - ]. Total scan time was the same for the sham group as for the genuine EA group. 

After treatments, sensations evoked by genuine and sham EA were measured with the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS), a rubric created by acupuncture researchers at MGH [ , ]. 


### fMRI Data Acquisition and Analysis 
  
Brain imaging was performed with a 3-axis gradient head coil in a 3 Tesla Siemens MRI System equipped for echo planar imaging. At the midpoint of the study, an MRI scanner upgrade replaced the 3 Tesla head-only Siemens Allegra MRI System with a 3 Tesla whole-body Siemens TIM Trio MRI System. To avoid any potential confounding due to scanner hardware and software changes, pre-post scanner upgrade studies were conducted at the Martinos Center at the time of transition from the Allegra to the Trio scanner system and the data were used to optimize the image acquisition parameters to be as closely matched as possible while still taking advantage of the benefits of the scanner upgrade. Multiple previous studies have demonstrated that when these careful measures are taken to match scan acquisition parameters, inter-subject variability is the predominant source of variance in structural and functional MRI data, regardless of scanner type or manufacturer [ - ]. Therefore we were careful to randomize comparable numbers of subjects from each of the four groups across the two scanner systems: 6-8 subjects per group were tested on the old scanner and 4-6 subjects per group were tested on the new scanner. 

Thirty axial slices (4 mm thick with 1 mm skip) parallel to the anterior and posterior commissure covering the whole brain were imaged with 2000 ms TR, 40 ms TE, 90° flip angle and 3.13 × 3.13 mm in-plane spatial resolution. For the scan acquired during EA stimulation, a total of 705 time points were collected during an acupuncture treatment lasting twenty-three minutes and 30 seconds. A high-resolution 3 D MPRAGE sequence for anatomic localization was also collected. 


### Functional Connectivity Analysis 
  
We used a spherical seed region located in the PAG, centered at 0 -28 -10 (Montreal Neurological Institute [  MNI  ] coordinates) with a 2 mm radius. This seed served as a pre-defined anatomical region from which we explored connectivity to other brain regions. The seed region coordinates are based on our previous analysis of the fMRI signal changes evoked by calibrated heat pain before and after treatment using this same data set. The PAG voxel with the maximal pain-evoked fMRI signal change after genuine EA treatment, as compared with sham EA treatment, was located at 0 -28 -10 [ ]. This location is situated in the ventral PAG, and as such, it belongs to the ""analgesic zone"" of the PAG [ ]. 

Methods for functional connectivity analysis were similar to previous studies [ - ]. In summary, the long EA scan for each subject was split into 3 epochs (as illustrated in Figure  ) in which the current was turned on for participants receiving genuine EA, with each ON epoch lasting 6 minutes. (The first 30 seconds of each EA treatment was excluded to account for the time subjects spent acclimating to the application of the current from the EA device). Functional data were first preprocessed to decrease image artifacts and to eliminate differences in odd/even slice intensity. Rigid body translation and rotation was used to reduce within- and across-run head movement. Data were re-sampled to 3 mm isotropic voxels after transforming anatomical and functional data to atlas space. 

The functional connectivity analysis required additional filtering of low- and high-frequency components (0.009 Hz < f < 0.083 Hz) and spatial 8 mm Gaussian kernel smoothing. Other variables that were simultaneously regressed included movement parameters, whole brain signal, lateral ventricle mean signals, deep white matter ROI signal, and the first temporal derivative of each time course. The resulting time course was used in the subsequent analysis. Next, we performed correlation maps between the seed region and all voxels across the whole brain. Analysis produced seed region-whole brain voxel correlation coefficients. Fisher's r-to-z transformation was used to convert correlation maps into z maps. 

Group analysis was applied with a random effects analysis using a one sample t-test. To further explore differences in the functional connectivity of PAG between the different acupuncture modes and expectancy levels, an analysis equivalent to an ANOVA was performed. More specifically, to calculate the main effect of acupuncture, a two-sample t-test comparing the pre- minus post difference was performed between the cohort receiving genuine acupuncture treatment (pooling the two expectancy groups) and the cohort receiving sham EA treatment (pooling the two expectancy groups). Then, to calculate the main effect of expectancy, a two-sample t-test comparing the pre- minus post difference was performed between the high expectancy condition (pooling the acupuncture groups) and the low expectancy condition (pooling the acupuncture groups). Finally, to calculate the interaction between expectancy and acupuncture, a two sample t-test comparing the pre- minus post difference was performed between the cohorts receiving genuine EA with high expectancy + sham EA with low expectancy and the cohorts receiving sham EA with high expectancy + genuine EA with low expectancy. This method has been used in our previous studies [ ] and is equivalent to the information provided by an ANOVA analysis. In addition, post-hoc comparisons were calculated to test the difference between treatment groups using a two-sample t-test. 

For all analyses, the threshold was set at voxel-wise   p   < 0.001. To correct for multiple comparisons, we ran Monte Carlo simulations with AlphaSim to obtain corrected type I error  . The results showed that, in our study, signal voxel threshold p < 0.001 combining 31 voxels has a corrected threshold of p < 0.05 at the cluster level. Thus, the threshold of voxel-wise p < 0.001 uncorrected with 31 contiguous voxels was used in this study. 



## Results 
  
Of seventy-seven healthy enrolled subjects, forty-eight (average age 26.4 ± 4.9; 24 males and 24 females) completed the study; each of the four treatment groups contained twelve subjects. 

### MASS ratings 
  
We used the MASS to quantify the intensity of subjects' sensations experienced during acupuncture treatment. Mean ratings differed between the genuine and sham group. For example, there were higher ratings of ""dull pain"", ""throbbing pain"" and ""soreness"" during genuine treatment, compared to sham. No sensations were rated higher in the sham group, compared to genuine. Additionally, there were sensations that did not differ between genuine and sham, e.g. ""warm"", ""fullness"", and ""heaviness"" yielded similar ratings in both treatment groups. To further assess whether there were differences in average MASS ratings amongst the four groups, we performed a fixed effect ANOVA using treatment mode (genuine and sham), and expectancy (high and low) as factors. The results showed that the four groups were significantly different, F (3,44) = 7.9, p = 0.0002. Subjects in both low and high expectancy genuine groups reported significantly greater MASS ratings than those in both sham groups (p < 0.002). There was no interaction between treatment mode and expectancy level (p = 0.8). 


### fMRI results 
  
Functional connectivity results (as shown in Table   and Figure  ) demonstrated that during genuine EA, there was predominant positive functional connectivity between the PAG and nearby brain structures, including the bilateral PAG and surrounding areas (midbrain tegmentum, substantia nigra, raphe nucleus, hypothalamus, striatum, globus pallidum, left insula, thalamus, hippocampus, brain stem, and cerebellum). In addition, there was significant functional connectivity between the PAG and certain distant brain regions, including bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), middle cingulate cortex (MCC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, inferior parietal lobule, and left postcentral gyrus.

Similarly, functional connectivity results (as shown in Table   and Figure  ) during sham EA showed a positive functional connectivity between the PAG and nearby brain structures equivalent to those activated by genuine EA. Additional brain regions that exhibited a significant connection with the seed include the right frontal operculum, anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus and occipital cortex. 

The main effect of acupuncture mode, as indicated by comparison of genuine and sham EA groups (as shown in Table   and Figure  ), showed that: during genuine EA, the PAG showed more connectivity with the left PCC than during sham EA; and during sham EA there was more connectivity to the anterior right insula (rAI)/inferior frontal gyrus than during genuine EA. The main effect of expectancy, determined by direct comparison of HE and LE groups, showed no brain regions above the threshold. An interaction between the treatment mode and expectancy level was observed in the activation of the right superior parietal lobule.

Post-hoc comparisons were calculated between the following groups: genuine EA with high expectancy vs. sham EA with high expectancy, genuine EA with high expectancy vs. genuine EA with low expectancy, sham EA with high expectancy vs. sham EA with low expectancy, and genuine EA with low expectancy vs. sham EA with low expectancy. The results indicated that genuine EA with high expectancy showed more connectivity at the right inferior parietal lobule (39 -60 48, 36 voxles) compared with genuine EA with low expectancy. In addition, genuine EA with low expectancy showed less connectivity at the right superior parietal lobule (21 -51 57, 47 voxels) compared with sham EA with low expectancy. Other comparisons showed no brain regions above the threshold. 



## Discussion 
  
In this study, we investigated functional connectivity of the PAG during genuine and sham EA. We found that during both genuine and sham EA, the PAG was significantly connected with brain areas surrounding the PAG, including the midbrain tegmentum, substantia nigra, raphe nucleus, hypothalamus, striatum, globus pallidum, left insula, thalamus, hippocampus, brain stem, and cerebellum as well as distant regions such as ACC, MPFC, MCC, PCC and precuneus. However, genuine EA - relative to sham EA - showed significantly stronger connectivity between the PAG and left PCC, and significantly weaker connectivity between the PAG and rAI. 

Our result that, during both genuine and sham EA, the PAG is functionally connected with surrounding regions and some distant regions, including the RVM and ACC, is similar to our previous study investigating the intrinsic functional connectivity of PAG during resting state using data from a different cohort [ ]. Thus, neither genuine nor sham EA appeared to significantly disrupt the connectivity between PAG and the network of brain regions seen during resting state. 

During genuine EA, we found that the PAG had a significantly stronger connectivity with the PCC. Through an examination of the existing literature, we could not find reliable evidence for a direct (monosynaptic) connection between the two structures; however, previous studies suggest a functional linkage between the PCC and brain stem [ ]. A di-synaptic connection is the most parsimonious solution for which direct evidence exists. Thus, we speculate that this functional linkage may be conveyed via the thalamus and ACC, two regions that have direct connections with both PCC and PAG. 

Previous studies have implicated the PCC's involvement in responses to treatment in chronic pain patients [ , ]. In a study by Niddam and colleagues [ ], patients with myofascial pain syndrome were given painful stimulations during fMRI, and in between scanning sessions the same area was treated with low-intensity electrostimulation. When comparing responders and non-responders, a treatment effect was observed for responders in the dorsal midbrain, PCC, and the caudate [ ]. 

In an early PET-study from 1995 [ ], a normalization of attenuated PCC activity after non-opioidergic treatment was seen in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. Patients with localized peripheral neuropathic pain were treated with a regional nerve block using lidocaine, resulting in significant analgesic effects. Interestingly, the neural correlate to the pain alleviated state was an increase of cerebral blood flow in the ACC and PCC. Hseieh et al. suggest that the increased neural response in the PCC could reflect the altered subjective perception of pain relief rather than the afferent blockade. The PAG is one of the key regions in the descending pain inhibitory circuitry, enabling regulation of afferent pain signals. The strong connectivity between the PAG and the PCC in response to active treatment furthers the idea that the PCC plays an important role in pain treatment. 

The PCC is a key region in the default mode network (DMN): a set of specific brain structures with intrinsic fluctuations that constitute a baseline of attention and wakefulness in the human brain [ - ]. In humans, the PCC has the highest level of resting cortical glucose metabolism [ ], and is involved in processing intentions related to the self, self-awareness and conscious experience, which are key functions attributed to the DMN [ , ]. DMN activity has been shown to decrease in relation to task-evoked activity, and demonstrates an inverse relationship with the cognitive work load of the task [ - ]. Other studies show that activity in the DMN decreases in response to repeated painful stimuli [ ], and chronic pain patients seem to exhibit permanently altered DMN activity. In a study by Baliki and colleagues [ ], chronic low back pain patients displayed reduced activity in several key DMN regions compared with healthy subjects. We believe the results from this study indicate that EA may modulate the functional connectivity of the DMN, as evidenced by the increased connectivity of PCC with PAG during EA stimulation. 

In this study we also found that during sham acupuncture, the PAG has stronger connectivity with the rAI compared with genuine acupuncture. The anterior insula is a key region in the pain matrix [ ] and is involved in integration and interoception of pain [ - ] and pain modulation processes such as placebo analgesia [ , ]. In a more recent study, investigators found that the pre-stimulus functional connectivity between the PAG and the anterior insula can predict subsequent pain perception [ ]. Thus, we speculate that EA stimulation may reduce brain responses to calibrated pain stimuli by interfering with the functional connectivity between the PAG and insula. Further research is needed to test this hypothesis. 

An interaction between the acupuncture treatment modes and expectancy levels was observed in right superior parietal lobule. Studies have suggested that this region is involved in attention [ ] and somatosensory perception modulation [ ]. We speculate that our results may indicate that functional connectivity in genuine and sham EA are differentially modulated by expectancy levels, however further research is needed to fully understand the sources of observed functional connectivity in this study. 

In this study, we did not find any significant functional connectivity changes between the high and low expectancy groups. We believed that this may be attributed to several reasons. 1) The PAG seed we chose for this study was identified in our previous analysis of the fMRI signal changes evoked by calibrated heat pain [ ] as being selectively involved in mediating acupuncture treatment effects (genuine EA vs sham EA) and not expectancy effects (high expectancy vs low expectancy). 2) Although previous studies suggested that PAG is involved in expectancy evoked placebo analgesia [ - ] or attention modulation of pain [ ], the involvement of PAG in these studies is observed during the pain application process; in contrast, this study measures functional connectivity changes during acupuncture treatment. Thus, our results are not necessarily in conflict with findings from previous studies. 3) The relatively small sample size may also prevent us from finding significant functional connectivity between the high and low expectancy conditions. Further study is needed to elucidate the influence of expectation of analgesia on the functional connectivity of PAG during the treatment phase. 


## Conclusions 
  
In summary, during continuous EA, functional connectivity changed significantly in brain regions including PCC and rAI. Our findings indicate the intrinsic functional connectivity changes among key brain regions in the pain matrix and default mode network during genuine EA compared with sham EA. We speculate that continuous genuine EA stimulation can modify the coupling of spontaneous activity in brain regions that play a role in modulating pain perception.

# Title

Neurobehavioral Mechanisms of Temporal Processing Deficits in Parkinson's Disease

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
Parkinson's disease (PD) disrupts temporal processing, but the neuronal sources of deficits and their response to dopamine (DA) therapy are not understood. Though the striatum and DA transmission are thought to be essential for timekeeping, potential working memory (WM) and executive problems could also disrupt timing. 


## Methodology/Findings 
  
The present study addressed these issues by testing controls and PD volunteers ‘on’ and ‘off’ DA therapy as they underwent fMRI while performing a time-perception task. To distinguish systems associated with abnormalities in temporal and non-temporal processes, we separated brain activity during encoding and decision-making phases of a trial. Whereas both phases involved timekeeping, the encoding and decision phases emphasized WM and executive processes, respectively. The methods enabled exploration of both the amplitude and temporal dynamics of neural activity. First, we found that time-perception deficits were associated with striatal, cortical, and cerebellar dysfunction. Unlike studies of timed movement, our results could not be attributed to traditional roles of the striatum and cerebellum in movement. Second, for the first time we identified temporal and non-temporal sources of impaired time perception. Striatal dysfunction was found during both phases consistent with its role in timekeeping. Activation was also abnormal in a WM network (middle-frontal and parietal cortex, lateral cerebellum) during encoding and a network that modulates executive and memory functions (parahippocampus, posterior cingulate) during decision making. Third, hypoactivation typified neuronal dysfunction in PD, but was sometimes characterized by abnormal temporal dynamics (e.g., lagged, prolonged) that were not due to longer response times. Finally, DA therapy did not alleviate timing deficits. 


## Conclusions/Significance 
  
Our findings indicate that impaired timing in PD arises from nigrostriatal and mesocortical dysfunction in systems that mediate temporal and non-temporal control-processes. However, time perception impairments were not improved by DA treatment, likely due to inadequate restoration of neuronal activity and perhaps corticostriatal effective-connectivity.

## Introduction 
  
Timing is a process that helps structure perception, cognition and movement. Prevailing models emphasize the role of the striatum and dopamine (DA) neurotransmission  ,   in regulating an internal clock that generates pulses and an accumulator that counts pulses, thereby representing perceived duration. The experience of time, however, can be dilated or compressed by working memory (WM), attention, and decisional processes  , which are cortically driven. Thus, timing emerges from interactions among multiple processes that are intertwined. When timing is disentangled from other processes, the striatum is closely linked to timing, whereas the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the middle-frontal and inferior parietal cortices are more associated with WM and executive processes, respectively  . 

The basal ganglia's role in timing is particularly relevant to individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), who exhibit temporal processing deficits  – . Timing deficits may contribute to the breakdown in the spatiotemporal patterning of movements in PD, which benefit from external rhythmic sensory-cueing  . The neuronal sources of timing impairments in PD and their response to DA therapy are not well understood. Whether DA therapy improves timing deficits is controversial  – ,  – . To date, three fMRI and one PET study of timing have been conducted in PD  – . Only two of these studies examined the effect of DA treatment  ,  , and all studied timed movements, so that it was not possible to distinguish abnormal activation in systems classically associated with motor-control (i.e., basal ganglia, cerebellum) from activity related to temporal processing. 

The present study addressed these issues by testing PD participants ‘on’ and ‘off’ their DA therapy as they underwent fMRI while performing a time-perception task. In this task, a standard interval (SI) and a comparison interval (CI) were successively encoded, followed by a decision about their relative duration. To identify neural systems related to different components of temporal processing, we separated brain activation associated with encoding the SI and holding it in WM from activation associated with encoding the CI and making a decision. We reasoned that the encoding phase would emphasize timekeeping, but also WM maintenance. Whereas the decision phase engages timekeeping as well, executive processes involved in updating WM and comparing information is also emphasized during this period  ,  ,  . We predicted that abnormal basal ganglia activation in PD would be seen during both phases if the striatum is critical for timekeeping. As SMA dysfunction is common in PD, we also expected abnormal activation during both phases if the SMA plays a key role in timekeeping  . Finally, we predicted abnormal middle-frontal cortex activation during the decision, but not the encoding phase if executive difficulties  ,   contribute to timing deficits in PD. To determine if the cognitive-control systems emphasized by the two phases respond differently to DA therapy  , we studied the effects of medication on brain activation and on striatal interactions with the cortex and cerebellum (i.e., effective connectivity). Though DA therapy was expected to improve striatal function, its effects on key cortical regions that support time perception (e.g., SMA, middle-frontal and inferior-parietal cortex) are unclear as this has not been previously studied. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants and Procedures 
  
Participants included 21 volunteers with idiopathic PD (14 males, 7 females) and 19 healthy adults (12 males, 7 females). Age and education were balanced between the groups ( ). Subjects were excluded if they had metal in their body, exhibited signs of dementia on a global dementia screening battery (Mini-Mental Status Exam score <25) and on neuropsychological tests of cognitive speed/flexibility, working memory span, and sustained attention (i.e., ≥1.5 standard deviations (SD) below the control group;  ), exhibited signs of depression (Geriatric Depression Score ≥10), or had a medical history of neurological diagnoses other than PD, severe psychiatric disorders (DSM-IV), diabetes, and alcohol or substance abuse. PD volunteers were excluded if they had axial tremors or dyskinesias that could cause head movement during scanning, or if they were taking cholinesterase inhibitors or neuroleptic medications. ANOVAs showed no group differences on neuropsychological tests of global dementia, cognitive speed/flexibility, verbal and spatial working memory, sustained attention and maximum tapping speed ( ). 
   Demographics, neuropsychological test performance  , and structural MRI volumes for the Control and Parkinson's groups.        
Board-certified neurologists with a specialty in motor disorders assessed all PD participants (D.D. Song and S. Lessig). PD participants exhibited at least two of the three cardinal features of the disorder (i.e., bradykinesia, resting tremor, motor rigidity), were levodopa responsive, and did not exhibit features of progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple systems atrophy, or dementia. Eighteen PD participants were taking levodopa/carbidopa, and all were taking one or more DA agonists or releasers. The mean levodopa equivalence (LDE) was 748.3 (SD  =  428)  . Symptoms on the motor examination section of the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were worse off [Mean (SD)  =  29.6 (10.4)] than on medication [Mean (SD)  =  22.2 (8.0)] [F(1, 20) = 20.9, p<.0001, η  = .51]. On the Hoehn and Yahr, 18 and 3 PD participants were stage 2 and 3, respectively, both off and on medication. 

PD participants completed two fMRI sessions that were conducted on separate days at the same time of day. For one fMRI session, PD volunteers took their normal daily medication dosage one hour before scanning (ON condition) so that they were studied in an optimally medicated state. In the other fMRI session, participants refrained from taking medication for at least 2 half-lives of the longest acting medication or a minimum of 16 to 24 hours before the scan (OFF condition) so that they were studied in a ‘practical’ off state. The control subjects performed the fMRI task once in the scanner and once in the laboratory; only behavioral data from the scanning session were analyzed. For both groups, the order of testing conditions was counterbalanced. The study was approved by the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Human Research Protections Program (HRPP). Study participants signed written informed-consent forms. 


### Functional MRI 
  
#### fMRI task 
  
In the time perception task ( ), subjects attended to the duration of successively presented pairs of filled-auditory or visual stimuli, and then judged whether the second stimulus was shorter or longer than the first. Throughout the experiment, the subject maintained fixation on a white cross at the center of the display. One second before trial onset, a warning signal (i.e., flashing yellow cross and mixed 700-Hz tone) appeared for 500 ms followed by a 500 ms delay. Trial onset began with presentation of an auditory (1000 Hz pure tone) or visual (blue circle) SI that lasted 1200 or 1800 ms, and was respectively followed by a 6800 or 6200 ms delay. Then a CI of the same modality was presented, after which the subject indicated if it was shorter or longer than the SI by pressing a key with the right index or middle finger. For each SI, there were 3 shorter and 3 longer CIs that differed from the SI by successive increments of ±7%. Two SIs were used to help ensure that subjects encoded signal duration on each trial. The analyses collapsed across SI duration. The analyses also collapsed across signal modality, as there were no group differences in timing auditory and visual signals (see   section), consistent with other reports  . Accuracy and reaction time (RT; from offset of the CI to key press) were measured. We did not include a sensorimotor control task since processing in sensory areas was of interest to our study. 
   Time perception paradigm and task performance.  
A) Trial events for the auditory and visual conditions of the time perception task. Trials were preceded by a 500 ms warning signal (i.e., flashing yellow fixation cross and a mixed 700 Hz auditory tone). At trial onset, an auditory or visual standard-interval (SI) (1200 or 1800 ms) was presented and followed by a delay (6800 or 6200 ms). At 8 s post-trial onset, a comparison interval (CI) of the same modality was presented. Image acquisition (TR  =  2 s) was pegged to the onsets on the SI and CI. The first 12 s of a trial (i.e., equivalent to 6 TRs) constituted the   encoding phase  . The last 12 s of a trial constituted the   decision phase.   B  ) Mean (standard error bars) accuracy for the auditory (left) and visual (right) conditions in the control group and PD OFF and ON conditions. Accuracy data were converted to the mean percent longer, and averaged across the two SI conditions and their respective CIs. On the x axis, ±7, 14, and 21 designate CIs that were 7%, 14%, and 21% shorter (negative values) or longer (positive values) than the SI. 
  
There were 30 trials per SI condition (i.e., auditory 1200 ms, auditory 1800 ms, visual 1200 ms, and visual 1800 ms), with 5 trials per CI for a total of 120 trials. Trials were divided into 8 runs of 15 trials each. Within a run, SI conditions were randomly presented. Image acquisition was synchronized with the onset of the SI and the CI. Each trial included a minimum of 9 images (i.e., 18 s) to reduce the likelihood of nonlinear summing of overlapping hemodynamic responses. Additional one to five ‘filler’ 2.0 s epochs (fixation cross) were randomly added to the end of each trail (i.e., 45 filler images per run). Jitter in the inter-trial interval allowed for the best sampling of the hemodynamic response and establishment of a baseline resting state in the model (i.e., fixation plus ambient scanner noise). A run began and ended with 5 additional filler images to respectively allow for T1 equilibration and the delayed hemodynamic response of the final trial. Each run consisted of 190 images acquired over 6 min and 20 s. 


#### Image acquisition 
  
Imaging was conducted at the UCSD Center for FMRI using a GE 3-T Excite MRI system equipped with an 8-channel head-coil. Whole-brain blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) weighted echo-planar images were acquired using a single-shot, blipped, gradient-echo echo-planar pulse sequence (TE =  30 ms, TR =  2.0 s, 90° flip angle, FOV = 24 cm, resolution  =  64×64). Thirty-seven contiguous, axial 4-mm slices (3.75×3.75×4-mm voxel size) provided whole-brain coverage. High-resolution T1-weighted anatomic images were collected for anatomic localization (3D spoiled gradient-recalled at steady-state, TE = 3.0 ms, TR = 7.8 ms, 12° flip angle, number of excitations (NEX)  =  1, 1-mm slice thickness, FOV = 25 cm, resolution  =  256×256). Foam padding was used to limit head motion. Auditory stimuli were delivered binaurally through a headphone that together with earplugs attenuated background scanner noise by about 40 db. Visual stimuli were viewed through a mirror mounted on the head-coil. 


#### Image analysis 
  
Functional images were generated using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) software. Time series images were spatially registered in 3-dimensional space and corrected for time-slice acquisition differences. A deconvolution analysis (correcting for scanner drift) was used to generate impulse response functions (IRFs) of the fMRI signal on a voxelwise basis. Each IRF was estimated relative to the baseline state (i.e., filler images), without a priori assumptions about the shape, delay, or magnitude of the IRF. Six head-motion parameters were included as covariates of no interest. Estimates of percent signal change (PSC) for each image acquired 0 s to 24 s post-stimulus onset were then calculated by taking the beta coefficient and dividing it by the model intercept. The PSC maps were interpolated to volumes with 1-mm  voxels, co-registered, converted to Talairach coordinate-space, and blurred using a 4-mm Gaussian root mean square filter. 


#### Spatial extent analysis 
  
This analysis examined the within-group spatial extent of activation. For each group (control, PD ON, PD OFF), statistical parametric maps were generated to identify voxels that exhibited a significant change in activation (i.e., PSC estimates) during each phase of the trial.   shows that the first 12 s of a trial (i.e., 6 TRs) constituted the   encoding phase  , during which the subject encoded the SI and held it in memory; the last 12 s constituted the   decision phase  , wherein the subject encoded the CI and judged its duration relative to the SI. Repeated-measures ANOVAs for each group tested the effect of time (i.e., 6 TRs for each phase), separately for the encoding and decision phases of a trial. Voxelwise thresholds were derived from 3,000 Monte Carlo simulations (AFNI AlphaSim), which computed the voxel probability and minimum cluster-size threshold needed to obtain a .05 familywise alpha. Because spatial thresholds are biased against smaller activation clusters of a priori interest (i.e., basal ganglia and midbrain nuclei), statistical thresholds were derived separately for basal ganglia/midbrain and cortical volumes  . This was accomplished by creating a basal ganglia/midbrain mask (i.e., claustrum, putamen, globus pallidus (GP), caudate, substantia nigra (SN), red nucleus, and subthalamic nucleus) using the Talairach Daemon dataset; the mask was then expanded to include any voxels within a 2 mm radius. The cortical mask included all other regions of the brain including the cerebellum. Each mask was used in the Monte Carlo simulations to determine the appropriate combination of individual voxel-probability and minimum cluster-size threshold. For the basal ganglia/midbrain volume, a voxelwise threshold of p<.008 and a minimum cluster size of .225 ml yielded a .05 familywise alpha. For the cortical volume, a voxelwise threshold of p<.004 and a minimum cluster size of .338 ml yielded a .05 familywise alpha. 


#### Functional region of interest analysis 
  
A functional region of interest (fROI) analysis was conducted to evaluate potential group differences. A fROI map was generated by conjoining activated regions identified in the above spatial extent analyses across the control group and the PD ON and OFF conditions. Thus, any voxel significantly activated in at least one of the groups or conditions contributed to the final fROI map. Two conjunctive maps were generated, one for the encoding and one for the decision phase. Masks from the Talairach Daemon dataset were then used to separate large clusters into functionally relevant regions, which were the basis for all subsequent analyses. 

Rather than focusing exclusively on peak activation, we analyzed group differences in the temporal dynamics or evolution of brain activity, since this might better characterize neuronal functioning as it does in normal aging  . This approach also avoided problems with assuming equivalence among regions in the time delay of hemodynamic responses to an event  . We first compared fROI between the control group and the OFF condition to evaluate the effects of disease on activation. The 2 (group; G) X 6 (time; T, where T   =  the first 6 TRs and T   =  the last 6 TRs of a trial) mixed-model ANOVA tested for the main effect of group (G) and its interaction with time (G X T), separately for the encoding and the decision phases. Next, regions that showed significant group effects were compared between the OFF and ON conditions to evaluate medication effects. The 2 (medication condition; Med) X 6 (T) repeated-measures ANOVA tested the main effect of medication condition (Med) and its interaction with time (Med X T), separately for the encoding and decision phases. If medication had an effect, mixed-model ANOVAs compared the ON condition with the control group to determine if DA normalized activation. The significance threshold was set at p<.03 for the cortical volumes and at p<.05 for the basal ganglia/midbrain volumes as the latter involved far fewer comparisons. The Huynh-Feldt correction adjusted for heterogeneity of variance in multiple degrees-of-freedom tests. 


#### Effective connectivity analysis 
  
In addition to the univariate tests that assessed the effect of medication on activation of individual fROI, we also asked if DA therapy altered interactions of the striatum with the cortex and cerebellum. This was achieved by conducting voxel-based tests of psychophysiological interactions (PPI) separately for the encoding and decision phases  . Voxels in the bilateral caudate and putamen, which showed abnormal activation OFF medication, were the seed ROI and were selected for each subject using the conjunctive maps generated for the fROI analyses. The experimental variable was medication state (ON, OFF). Multiplication of the deconvolved time series for the seed areas with the experimental variable formed the interaction term (i.e., PPI regressor), which tested whether connectivity of the striatum with the whole brain was modulated by medication. A p<.005 voxelwise threshold and a .225 ml minimum cluster size was the criterion for significance. 



### Structural MRI Analysis 
  
To assess group differences in striatal, cerebral, and cerebellar volume, automated cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation of T1-weighted images was performed using FreeSurfer ( ), which is a vertex-based approach. Processing included removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure   and transformation to Talairach space. This was followed by segmentation of subcortical white- and deep gray-matter volumetric structures  , intensity normalization  , tessellation of the gray-white matter boundary, automated topology correction  ,  , and surface deformation following intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class  . Transformation and segmentations were manually verified. This approach provides anatomically accurate renderings of regional volumes, without potential rater bias  . To account for differences in head size, volumes were divided by estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV).   shows that striatum and cerebral/cerebellar gray-matter volumes did not differ between groups (p values >.05). 



## Results 
  
### fMRI Task Performance 
  
Accuracy was converted to the percent longer responses for each CI, per convention. CIs that were increments of ±7%, 14% or 21% shorter/longer than the SI were averaged across the SI conditions. A mixed-model ANOVA compared the control group with the OFF condition, testing the main effect of group, modality (audition, vision), CI, and the interactions. The group X CI interaction [F(3.6,137.6) = 3.8, p<.005] was due to worse performance (i.e., flatter slope, lower accuracy) in the OFF condition than in the control group ( ). The modality X CI interaction [F(5,190) = 2.3, p<.05] indicated that performance was worse for visual than auditory intervals in both groups. No other significant effects were found. The OFF and ON conditions were then compared. The repeated-measures ANOVA showed no effect of medication on performance, irrespective of modality. This was consistent with a mixed-model ANOVA comparing the control group with the ON condition, which showed a group X CI interaction [F(3.2,121) = 3.4, p<.02]. No other group effects were found. As for RTs, group and medication effects were not significant (Mean (SE): Controls  =  2316 ms (68); OFF  =  2322 ms (65); ON  =  2404 ms (74)). However, RTs were longer for visual (Mean (SE)  =  2390 ms (54)) than auditory intervals (Mean (SE)  =  2292 ms (54) in both groups [F1,38) = 7.0, p<.01]. 


### fMRI Spatial Extent Analysis 
  
Descriptive analyses of the spatial extent of activation indicated that total volume of activation was reduced in both phases by approximately 28% in the PD OFF group relative to the controls. Frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe volumes were reduced 15% to 20% in the OFF group, irrespective of phase. However,   shows that for both phases volume reductions of more than 25% were seen OFF medication in the bilateral preSMA/SMA/cingulate (33% for both phases), thalamus (36% to 39%), striatum (27% to 30%), midbrain nuclei (27% to 30%), parahippocampus (83% to 85%), occipital lobe (39% to 49%), and cerebellum (65% for both phases). Whereas medication appeared to increase activation extent,   shows that the spatial extent of activation typically remained lower relative to the control group (see   and   for activation volumes in the whole brain, and   and   for details about activation foci).

### Functional ROI Analysis 
  
The conjoined fMRI activation-masks in   show that similar regions of activation were found during both phases of the trial (see   for details about activation foci).   also shows that group differences were found in only a subset of these regions (i.e., yellow), and were partially related to the behavioral context. For example, the PD OFF group exhibited abnormal preSMA/SMA/cingulate, precentral, middle-frontal, parietal, insula, inferior-temporal, right-parahippocampus, and lateral-cerebellum activation during the encoding phase. In contrast, posterior-cingulate and left-parahippocampus activations were abnormal during the decision phase. Only the striatum and vermis exhibited abnormal activation during both phases. We now turn to the statistical analyses in support of these observations.

Functional ROIs were derived from conjoining activation maps in   and  , respectively. Yellow regions designate significant group (Control vs. PD OFF) differences in activation; red regions indicate no significant group differences. Brain activation is projected onto the lateral and medial surfaces of the left and right hemispheres (rows 1 and 2), the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cerebellum (row 3), and the left and right basal ganglia (row 4).

This figure shows that hemodynamic responses return to baseline in some fROI, but not in others because the trial extends beyond the encoding of the SI, including activity related to WM maintenance. In all regions, the temporal dynamics of activation differed between the groups (G X T). In the striatum, hemodynamic responses were attenuated and temporally lagged OFF medication relative to controls. Hemodynamic responses were also attenuated OFF medication and returned to baseline levels soon after peak activation in left preSMA/SMA/cingulate, left precentral gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, left inferior-temporal cortex, and right insula; by comparison, activation in the control group was robust for longer periods. In contrast, right middle-frontal gyrus (MFG), left inferior-parietal cortex, and bilateral lateral cerebellar activity was attenuated OFF medication and prolonged relative to the control group. Moreover, no significant activation was seen OFF medication in the right parahippocampus and vermis.

In bilateral putamen, peak activation was normal, but prolonged relative to controls. In bilateral caudate, peak activation was lagged, attenuated and prolonged relative to controls. No significant activation was seen in the posterior cingulate and the left parahippocampus, and there was only a trend (p<.05) for vermis activation; these results contrasted with significant activation in the control group in all three regions. No other group differences were found.

Medication significantly attenuated the prolonged time-courses of putamen activity, but did not normalize activation relative to the control group (G X T: p<.025). In contrast, medication enhanced and normalized vermis activity. 



### Effective Connectivity Analysis 
  
Effective connectivity analyses showed that interactions of the striatum with the cortex were modulated by DA therapy, but only in the decision phase.   and   show that DA therapy significantly modulated interactions between the striatum and the cortex (i.e., SMA, precentral and postcentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus (SFG), MFG, superior and inferior parietal cortex, precuneus, and insula), but not the cerebellum.   graphs representative PPI. Corticostriatal interactions were stronger OFF than ON medication. An exception was stronger connectivity ON than OFF therapy between the left putamen and the left SFG (BA 6).

## Discussion 
  
The present study uncovered four new findings that elucidated neurobehavioral mechanisms of time perception deficits in PD and their response to DA therapy. First, impaired time perception OFF medication was associated with abnormal activation in systems regularly associated with time perception in studies of healthy adults  ,  ,  –  including the striatum, selected cortical sites (e.g., preSMA/SMA, cingulate gyrus, precentral and postcentral gyri, insula, middle-frontal and inferior-parietal cortex, parahippocampus) and the cerebellum (lobules, vermis). Unlike studies of timed movement, our results could not be attributed to classic motor-control functions of the basal ganglia or the cerebellum. Second, for the first time we were able to better distinguish temporal and non-temporal sources of cognitive dysfunction in time perception by separating activity during the encoding and decision phases. Our finding of striatal dysfunction in both phases was consistent with the role of DA neurotransmission in timekeeping operations. In addition, our results suggested that non-temporal operations emphasized by each phase were also disrupted in PD. Specifically, activation was abnormal in a classic WM network (middle frontal-inferior parietal, SMA, lateral cerebellum) during the encoding phase, whereas activation was absent in a network that mediates executive processes and memory (posterior-cingulate, parahippocampus) during the decision phase. Third, another novel finding was that neuronal dysfunction in PD was sometimes characterized by abnormal temporal dynamics. For example, hemodynamic responses of the striatum were typically attenuated, but also temporally lagged and sometimes prolonged; activity was also prolonged in a WM network (middle frontal-inferior parietal cortex, lateral cerebellar). These findings cannot be explained by longer RTs in PD, which did not differ from the control group. Fourth, DA therapy did not alleviate time perception deficits, despite its robust benefit on motor symptoms (UPDRS). Our fMRI results suggested that this was likely due to insufficient restoration of neuronal activation and perhaps corticostriatal effective-connectivity. We now discuss these findings more completely. 

### Striatal Dysfunction in PD 
  
As predicted, striatal activation OFF medication was abnormal during both phases of a trial, consistent with its role in timekeeping. During interval encoding, attenuated and temporally lagged striatal activity may suggest weakened and delayed processing of input from multiple corticostriatal loops. Theoretically, weakened and lagged striatal activation should disrupt integration of cortical input over time, a key function of the ‘core timer.’ Specifically, by the striatal beat frequency (SBF) model, sensory input is translated into cortical oscillatory patterns, which support the clock signal, and striatal medium-spiny neurons serve as a core timer by detecting and integrating oscillatory states over time  . Thus, impaired time perception in PD may be partially related to deficient striatal integration of cortical input. This may be due to diminished nigrostriatal phasic-DA, which it thought to signal the onset and offset of a to-be-timed event  . 

We also found striatal dysfunction during the decision phase, wherein peak activation of the putamen/GP was normal in PD, yet sustained longer relative to the control group; caudate activity was also sustained, but temporally lagged and attenuated. Although both phases involve timekeeping, the duration of two intervals is compared only during the decision phase. Sustained striatal activity leads us to speculate that it reflects compensation for difficulties in additional processes including updating WM with the CI   and comparing it with the SI. These processes require fast, flexible striatal-reactions, which are our study shows are temporally lagged and sometimes prolonged in PD during decision making and may be a basis for cognitive inflexibility  . 


### Disease-Related Cortical and Cerebellar Activity 
  
Time perception impairments OFF medication were also associated with abnormal cortical and cerebellar activity. A unique finding was that these abnormalities partially depended on the context, despite activation of similar regions in both phases (  and   for details about activation foci for each phase). During the encoding phase, hypoactivation was found in the cerebellum (lobules, vermis) and cortical areas of the motor (preSMA/SMA/cingulate, precentral/postcentral gyrus), executive (middle-frontal, inferior parietal), and limbic (parahippocampus, insula, inferior temporal) corticostriatal loops  . In the motor loop, preSMA/SMA dysfunction only during encoding was notable as it is at odds with a fundamental role for the SMA in timekeeping  . SMA dysfunction is common in PD and is traditionally attributed to difficulties with internally-generated behaviors. However, a more pivotal distinction may relate to its role in WM, specifically online storage of output from the motor pathway  ,  . By this proposal, SMA dysfunction in PD should be manifested particularly when maintenance is emphasized, as during the encoding phase wherein the SI is held in memory for over 6 s. 

Memory-related difficulties during interval encoding were also suggested by PD participants' prolonged activation in a classic WM-network (middle-frontal, precentral, inferior-parietal, lateral cerebellum)  . This may suggest ‘compensatory processing’ for diminished preSMA/SMA functioning, but perhaps also for hypoactivity of the insular cortex, which has efferent connections to WM networks and the striatum  . The insula integrates processing from disparate domains (e.g., interoception, emotion, WM) including time  ,  ,  ,  ,  . Recent models suggest that the insula is an attentional ‘hub’ that assists central executive networks in generating accurate responses to salient or task-relevant events  ,  . In our study, insula dysfunction may be manifested during interval encoding due to uncertainty about the to-be-attended modality at trial onset, which accentuates attentional demands. This prospect is compatible with normal insula activation during the decision phase, wherein top-down attention mechanisms might enhance insula activation since the CI modality is certain as it always matches the SI. Memory-related deficits OFF therapy were further evidenced in the encoding phase by the striking absence of activity in the right parahippocampus, damage to which disrupts time perception  . 

Cortical dysfunction during the decision phase was unexpectedly confined to a medial ‘default-mode network’ (left parahippocampus, bilateral posterior cingulate)  . Activation was absent in this network OFF medication, in contrast to the control group. To our knowledge, parahippocampus dysfunction has not been reported in non-demented PD, whereas evidence for posterior-cingulate dysfunction remains debated  – . We speculate that abnormal functioning of this network emerged during decision making due to the emphasis on executive processes (e.g., comparison of the SI and CI) and/or retrieval, which are modulated by this system  . Together with the absence of activity in the right parahippocampus during the encoding phase, deficient functioning of this network may underlie distortions in memory for time in PD  , and may be an early marker of memory problems. 

It was notable that vermis activity was greatly reduced OFF medication during both phases, as was lateral cerebellar activity during encoding. Our results contrast with cerebellar hyperactivity in PD during timed movements  – , which is attributed to compensation for striatal dysfunction. Although direct support for this proposal is lacking, hyperactivity of the cerebellum during timed movement, but not time perception may reflect an increased reliance on sensorimotor-coordination functions of the cerebellum, rather than purported timekeeping functions  . 


### Dopamine Modulation of Brain Activation and Corticostriatal Connectivity 
  
Our results showed that DA therapy did not alleviate time perception deficits, consistent with some  , but not all studies  ,  ,  . At first glance our results seem to conflict with the effects of DA agonists and antagonists on timing in animals  . However, our fMRI findings suggest that time perception does not benefit from DA therapy when activity is not sufficiently reinstated in timekeeping and non-temporal control systems known to mediate time perception. Specifically, during the encoding phase, treatment did not alter activation in the striatum or a WM network (SMA, middle frontal-inferior parietal cortex, lateral cerebellum), nor did it affect interactions of the striatum with other brain areas (effective connectivity). Likewise, during the decision phase impoverished activity in the default mode network (posterior cingulate, left parahippocampus) was not improved by DA therapy, nor was activity in the caudate, which interacts with this network  . 

There were some benefits of medication on brain activation, but they were circumscribed. During the encoding phase, treatment normalized attenuated limbic system (right insula and right parahippocampus) and vermis activity, possibly via the mesocortical-DA system. During the decision phase, DA therapy normalized vermis activity and improved, but did not restore the temporal dynamics of the putamen. Interestingly, DA therapy also mediated striatal interactions with the cortex, but not the cerebellum. Two patterns of effective connectivity were found, consistent with a recent study of motor timing in PD  . First, the striatum showed greater connectivity OFF than ON medication with the MFG, SMA, precentral/postcentral cortex, insula, and parietal cortex. Enhanced connectivity OFF therapy might appear counterintuitive since corticostriatal connectivity can be reduced OFF medication relative to controls  . However, animal models suggest that enhanced connectivity after DA depletion may reflect excessive synchronicity in corticostriatal circuits  , which disrupts rapid, flexible updating/integration by the striatum in contexts that call for cognitive flexibility  , such as the decision phase. Second, we also found that the putamen showed greater connectivity ON than OFF medication with the left SFG. Enhanced connectivity ON medication could reflect reduced inhibitory output from the striatum to an area that normally supports temporal decision-making  ,  . These speculations require further research as mechanisms of effective-connectivity in PD and their regulation by DA are not understood. Altogether, our finding of DA-mediated striatal activation and connectivity only during the decision phase is consistent with its effects on flexibility control-mechanisms, which are driven by the striatum and nigrostriatal DA  . Nevertheless, functioning is not restored in networks important for time perception. 


### Summary 
  
The present results illuminated the neurobehavioral mechanisms of time perception deficits in PD by distinguishing abnormal activity in the encoding and decision phases of a trial, which we hypothesized would both engage timekeeping, but accentuate demands on different non-temporal control processes. As predicted, neuronal dysfunction was found in a purported timekeeping center (striatum) in both phases. In addition, neuronal dysfunction in the encoding and decision phases was respectively manifested in WM/attentional (SMA, middle-frontal and inferior-parietal cortex, lateral cerebellum, insula, right parahippocampus) and executive processing/memory (left parahippocampus, bilateral posterior cingulate) centers. The temporal dynamics of activation in PD were also abnormal in the striatum and a frontoparietal-cerebellar network, which better characterized the basis for disturbances in timekeeping (temporally lagged and/or prolonged) and WM (prolonged). However, DA therapy did not alleviate time perception deficits in PD. Our fMRI results suggested that restoration of neuronal functioning was insufficient, possibly due to largely tonic effects of treatment, which fail to restore the balance of phasic and tonic DA in nigrostriatal and mesocortical pathways  .

# Abstract
 
The striatum has been established as a carrier of reward-related prediction errors. This prediction error signal concerns the difference between how much reward was predicted and how much reward is gained. However, it remains to be established whether general breaches of expectation, i.e., perceptual prediction errors, are also implemented in the striatum. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the role of caudate nucleus in breaches of expectation. Importantly, breaches were not related to the occurrence or absence of reward. Preceding the fMRI study, participants were trained to produce a sequence of whole-body movements according to auditory cues. In the fMRI session, they watched movies of a dancer producing the same sequences either according to the cue (88%) or not (12%). Caudate nucleus was activated for the prediction-violating movements. This activation was flanked by activity in posterior superior temporal sulcus, the temporo-parietal junction and adjacent angular gyrus, a network that may convey the deviating movement to caudate nucleus, while frontal areas may reflect adaptive adjustments of the current prediction. Alternative interpretations of caudate activity relating either to the saliency of breaches of expectation or to behavioral adaptation could be excluded by two control contrasts. The results foster the notion that neurons in the caudate nucleus code for a breach in expectation, and point toward a distributed network involved in detecting, signaling and adjusting behavior and expectations toward violated prediction.

## Introduction 
  
The striatum was once considered a site of solely motor function, but research over the last three decades has put its cognitive functions more and more into focus (e.g., Alexander et al.,  ; Saint-Cyr,  ; Grahn et al.,  ). One prominent function of the striatum is the coding of a reward prediction error in learning. These prediction errors are triggered by reinforcement or reward in conditioning paradigms (Schultz et al.,  ,  ; Schultz,  ). Reward prediction errors are signified by increases in striatal firing in the presence of unexpected reward or the presence of a reward-predicting cue, or by a decrease of firing when predicted reward is omitted. The underlying notion to a reward prediction error is that the brain is capable of associating the current circumstances with a specific future state (Wolpert and Flanagan,  ; Friston,  ). If the future becomes present and the state is different from what was predicted, this violation of predictions causes a prediction error, which in turn incites learning. 

That the brain is a “predictive machine” is a feature of many models concerned with learning, action, and perception (Rescorla and Wagner,  ; Schultz and Dickinson,   Kiebel et al.,  ; Bubic et al.,  ; Friston,  ). In an extension of the theory of motor control (Wolpert and Flanagan,  ), the brain's ability to constantly predict ongoing movement, be it in the motor domain or in perception, has been emphasized (Schutz-Bosbach and Prinz,  ). Presence of prediction implies the possibility of computing prediction errors, to adjust internal models according to perceptions and thus shape the correct predictions. The exact anatomic implementation of not reward-related prediction error signals, that code for unexpected perceptions has yet to be revealed (Zacks et al.,  ). The proposed involvement of dopamine (Zacks et al.,  ) and the striatum's extensive connectivity (Alexander et al.,  ; Saint-Cyr,  ) render it a likely candidate as a site of not only reward-related prediction errors but also more general not reward-related prediction errors. 

In fact, there is some evidence that striatal firing-patterns indeed convey prediction errors that are not related to reward. The respective authors likewise used the term prediction error to describe this dorso-striatal activity (Horvitz,  ; Schultz and Dickinson,  ; Graybiel,  ). For the sake of distinction, we will refer to activation that has an amplitude that varies with the amount of (expected) reward as “reward prediction errors.” The prediction errors investigated in the current study, that have a positive amplitude to all violated predictions, will be called “breach of expectation” signals. This breach signal is related to a violated prediction in the simplest sense, i.e., a prediction of any given content is not fulfilled. Accordingly, increased activity toward every unexpected stimulus signifies the breach of expectation signal in dorsal striatum. Indeed, recent imaging studies in humans report caudate nucleus activity for unexpected changes in context, rules, and contingencies (Bunge et al.,  ; Delgado et al.,  ; O'Doherty et al.,  ; Badgaiyan et al.,  ; Koch et al.,  ; den Ouden et al.,  ,  ). These activations can be broadly interpreted as corresponding to the occurrence of unpredicted stimuli. The study of Davidson et al. ( ), for example, revealed a negative response of the caudate to unexpected target omission, which could be reframed as occurrence of a unpredicted target-free stimulus. 

Taken collectively, the data suggest that caudate prediction error signals are not restricted to conditioning protocols and that they do not revolve solely around the availability of reward. The empirical evidence implies the presence of breach of expectation signals in caudate nucleus when an event deviates from predictions, but there is a need to probe the assumption directly. 

The lack of studies that target breach of expectation signals is surprising given not only the role they play in current computer models on the matter (Kilner et al.,  ; Kiebel et al.,  ; Friston,  ) but the enormous relevance of correcting false assumptions to prevent possibly fatal future mistakes. The educative effect of breaches of expectation is so strong that it operates even when observing other peoples behavior. Consider the example of seeing someone being bitten by a bulldog after having tread on its paw. If you used to regard bulldogs as aggressive animals, this would not breach your expectations and not incite changes in your views on bulldogs and your behavior toward them. In other words, you wouldn't have learned anything. Now consider watching someone being bitten by a poodle after stepping on its paw. This may be a severe breach of your expectations and teach you to regard poodles more suspiciously in future and adapt your behavior toward them accordingly. This is an example of observational learning, which does not imply direct reinforcement – it also embellishes two things. The first is the importance of the severity of a breach of expectation to learning. The second is the bonus derived from valid forward models in guiding behavior. 

The current study investigates whether caudate nucleus signals for breaches of expectation in a movement observation paradigm. We hypothesized that watching a dancer make a mistake in a setting of clear-cut cue-movement schedule would yield a caudate response. To keep track of the dancer's performance, participants had to register auditory cues that determined what movement the dancer was to perform next, and watch the ensuing movements. To ensure that all participants were capable of the required prediction, we subdued them to motor training, where they had to accord to the cue-movement schedule themselves. 

Breaches of expectation carry two secondary attributes that could each potentially cause striatal activations. Specifically, these events are of an increased saliency and often prompt to modify ongoing behavior. Saliency can be conceived of as a function of stimulus frequency (Zink et al.,  ) and is an attribute carried of not-habituated stimuli (Redgrave and Gurney,  ). As violated predictions were rarely encountered in the present paradigm, i.e., infrequent, they might hence elicit striatal activation due to their saliency (Horvitz,  ; Redgrave and Gurney,  ). Movement switches as opposed to executing one movement repeatedly have also been associated with striatal activity (Roy et al.,  ; Graybiel,  ). Encountering violated predictions in the paradigms is related to having to switch to a new internal movement simulation to keep track of the task. Moreover, as the paradigm included extensive training, there may have been an association of movement errors with initiation of a new movement. Hence, saliency and movement switches had to be investigated separately, to ensure that these attributes of violated predictions could not account for potentially recorded striatal activity. 

We employed an experimental design that allowed to test whether caudate activity actually reflects breaches of expectation (violation hypothesis – i), or is rather dependent on effects of saliency (saliency hypothesis – ii) or switching to a different behavior (change hypothesis – iii). Breaches of expectation were modeled by contrasting predicted with prediction-violating movements. In accordance with the frequency or habituation approach in the literature, we modeled saliency as a function of stimulus frequency in the immediate trial history. Initiation of a new movement was implemented in the movement observation paradigm by contrasting the cues that indicated a new upcoming movement against cues that indicated a movement repetition. 

Although the present study focused on striatal responses, it was to be expected that they come along with cortical activations, as a prominent characteristic of the neostriatum is its pronounced connectivity with a large number of cortical regions and thalamic nuclei (Alexander et al.,  ; Saint-Cyr,  ). More specifically, activation could be expected in regions related to the processing of biological motion (due to the mismatch between perceived and expected stimulus; Keysers and Perrett,  ) and those related to attentional modulation more generally (due to the explicit instruction rendering breaches of expectation task-relevant; Corbetta and Shulman,  ). 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Fourteen right-handed, healthy participants (eight women, age 22–29, mean age 24.8) took part in the study. Each participant's laterality quotient, as assessed with the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield,  ) was higher than 60. All participants were health screened by a physician and gave informed written consent. 


### Task-systematic 
  
The movement repertoire consisted of five whole-body movements. Each movement consisted of three sub-movements which engaged a characteristic combination of extremities (Figure  ). Each of these movements was assigned an arbitrary name, comprising three syllables, each associated with one corresponding sub-movement (Ko-re-pa; Fe-so-da; Gu-la-mi; Ba-ki-te; Wa-ne-ro). None of these names is meaningful in German; neither were the combinations of the two first or last syllables of each. Importantly, in the course of the experiment, each movement (e.g., Ko-re-pa) could only be followed by one specific other (e.g., Fe-so-da) or by a repetition of itself (e.g., Ko-re-pa). Two piano chords, easily discernible even in absence of former musical training, were used to cue the transition between two movements. Each cue coincided with the onset of one movement and delivered an instruction on which movement was to   follow   the respective movement that had began when the cue sounded. The low chord meant that the transition following the current movement had to be a repetition (i.e., the same movement again; if the movement that started when the cue was presented was for example Ko-re-pa, the low chord meant it had to be followed by another Ko-re-pa). The high chord signaled that the transition following the current movement had to be a switch (i.e., the corresponding next movement; if the concurring movement was Ko-re-pa, the high chord meant it had to be followed by Fe-so-da). Switches were always switches to the next movement in a circular order (Figure  ), no movement was ever skipped. Thus, the upcoming movement was fully predictable, even if it differed from the current movement. 
  
 Movement sequence with depiction of respective sub-movements; the cue presented at each movement onset, determines the transition after completion of respective movement; low tune (red note): repetition of the movement (follows red line); high tune (green note): switch to the next movement (follow the green line)  . Example: (i) a high chord sounds before ko-re-pa (2), indicating that the next movement must be fe-so-da (3 – a switch must take place); before fe-so-da starts, a low chord sounds (4) indicating that fe-so-da (5) must be followed by fe-so-da (6 repetition). 
  

### Schedule 
  
The overall experimental schedule compromised three stages. Participants first had to pass a computer based behavioral experiment (stage 1) to be admitted to training (stage 2). If they completed training successfully, they were allowed to participate in the fMRI experiment (stage 3), which was virtually identical to the initial behavioral probe. The two test sessions and the movement training incorporated the same system of dynamically evolving movement sequences. 


### Stage 1: behavioral probe session 
  
In the computer task, participants watched a dancer performing according to cue, but occasionally making mistakes. Previous to playing the task, the participants were instructed on the cue-movement associations that rule the task (low chord: repetition; high chord: switch). They received a short training where they could choose either four or eight example movies that contained up to 19 cued movements, before they started the task. The movie of the dancer was displayed in the middle of an otherwise gray computer screen, using the Software Presentation 12.0 (Neurobehavioral Systems, San Francisco, CA, USA). Visual input did not extend further than 5° of visual angle. The movies were stopped in irregular intervals and participants had to indicate by button press, whether the dancer had performed correctly immediately before video offset. That is, participants had to indicate whether the very last movement had been correct, irrespective of possible earlier errors. Questions were indicated by a question mark (“?”) displayed in font size 24 for 1500 ms or until the first response. Participants had to press the arrow-to-the-left key (index finger) if they judged the last movement to have been according to cue or press the arrow-to-the-right key (middle finger) if they thought the movement had not been according to cue. Responses had to be given within a timeframe of 1500 ms and were followed by a valid feedback for 400 ms indicating correct, incorrect or delayed responses (“+”/“−”/“0”; Figure  ). 
  
 Example for two alternative task-developments: Each picture is one movement within a movie, the notes signify high or low chords  . The actress could either perform the last movement before offset correctly (1), meaning the participants would have to judge the performance as correct by index finger button press (“y”). Or the last movement was not according to cue, a breach of expectation (2); the participants would then have to answer by middle-finger button press (“n”) to judge the dancer's behavior as incorrect. Errors’ during the movie where not to be judged upon. Movie offset and thus relevance of the error to the task was not predictable. 
  
In both the behavioral and the fMRI session, the task encompassed 400 single movements. Thirty-two movements were not according to cue, i.e., the dancer switched to the next movement when a repetition had been cued (16), or a repetition was performed after a switch had been announced (16). Forty breaks disrupted the movie, which was thus divided into 41 videos of varying duration (3–17 movements each). In the behavioral experiment, all 40 breaks were question trials, 20 of them requesting an affirmative answer. 

Up to four cues of the same kind, i.e., repetition or switch cues, could appear in a row. At the latest after the fourth identical transition cue (fourth switch or fourth repetition), a dissimilar transition was cued. Across the experiment, four, three, two, and one identical transitions after another appeared equally often. Thus, each cue that was dissimilar from the preceding cues could be differentiated from other first dissimilar cues by the number of preceding transitions that had been identical to each other. For example, a repetition cue could be the first repetition after two switches, or the first repetition after four switches. This randomization was employed to test for the assumptions of the saliency hypothesis (ii). The number of preceding different cues was a measurement of cue saliency against the backdrop of recent cue history. 


### Stage 2: movement training 
  
The participants that passed the 85% criterion of the behavioral experiment subsequently received six 1-h movement-training sessions within 10 days in order to establish a routine-like training stage for the cued performance of movement sequences. Training sessions were conducted in a small dance hall, one side walled with a mirror. During the first session, participants were taught the strict order of the five encompassed movements and learnt accurate performance of the single movements and the associated movement names. To that end, they were allowed to watch a model performing the respective movement on a laptop screen as often as they liked. Once the trainers were satisfied with accuracy of movement performance, participants were verbally instructed to conduct movement sequences, starting each movement when it was called out to them. In their second training session, participants learnt to move according to the cues. They started with a two-cue sequence. For example: Participants were told to start with the movement Ko-re-pa, as soon as the first cue sounded. If the cuing chord was low, they performed Ko-re-pa twice. Importantly they had to start the second Ko-re-pa after the second cue had rung. They had to withhold the third movement corresponding to the second cue, as they would only have been allowed to start the movement upon presentation of a third cue. Once every participant mastered this first step, the number of successive movements (cues) was constantly increased. If one or more participants made a mistake, the sequence had to be started from the beginning. This procedure was implemented in every training session forthwith, at the end of which participants mastered up to 18 cues in a row. Importantly, during training, more than four identical transitions in a row were possible. At the same time, participants had to keep moving at a high level of accuracy and trainers would correct them verbally, and, if necessary, by showing the model-video, over the entire course of training. At the end of the last training session, participants were filmed while performing three 15-cue sequences without further assistance (motor probe). During recording, they wore uniform clothing to allow for unbiased assessment of their performance in a later video evaluation. 


### Stage 3: fMRI session 
  
In the fMRI session that was scheduled for the day after each participant's respective last training session, they encountered the same task as in the behavioral probe. Participants lay supine on the scanner. Their head and arms were stabilized using form-fitting cushioning and their hands rested on a rubber foam tablet. On the right hand side, a response panel was mounted and fixed on the tablet. With their right hand index and middle finger resting on two response buttons, participants were able to judge on the correctness of the dancers movements within the same response contingencies as in the behavioral test. They wore earplugs to attenuate scanner noise and received auditory input via headphones. Participants received visual input on a mirror that was built into the head-coil and adjusted individually to allow for a comfortable view of the entire screen. All parameters were identical to the behavioral experiment (stage 1) with the exception that 24 breaks were used for question trials and 16 for null events (empty trials). 


### Data acquisition 
  
A 3T Siemens Magnetom Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) was used in the functional imaging session. In a separate session, prior to the functional MRT, high-resolution 3D T1 weighted whole-brain MDEFT sequences were recorded for every participant (128 slices, field of view 256 mm, 256 × 256 pixel matrix, thickness 1 mm, spacing 0.25 mm). The functional session engaged a single-shot gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence sensitive to blood oxygen level dependent contrast (28 slices, parallel to the bicommisural plane, echo time 30 ms, flip angle 90°; repetition time 2000 ms; interleaved recording). Following the functional session immediately, a set of T1 weighted 2D-FLASH images was acquired for each participant (28 slices, field of view 200 mm, 128 × 128 pixel matrix, thickness 4 mm, spacing 0.6 mm, in-plane resolution 3 × 3 mm). 


### fMRI data analysis 
  
Functional data were offline motion-corrected using the Siemens motion protocol PACE (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Further processing was conducted with the LIPSIA (Lohmann et al.,  ) software package. Cubic-spline interpolation was used to correct for the temporal offset between the slices acquired in one scan. To remove low-frequency signal changes and baseline drifts, a 1/80 Hz filter was applied. The matching parameters (6 degrees of freedom, 3 rotational, 3 translational) of the T1 weighted 2-D FLASH data onto the individual 3-D MDEFT reference set were used to calculate the transformation matrice for linear registration. These Matrices were subsequently normalized to a standardized Talairach brain size (  x   = 135,   y   = 175,   z   = 120 mm; Talairach and Tournoux,  ) by linear scaling. The normalized transformation matrices were then applied to the functional slices, to transform them using trilinear interpolation and align them with the 3-D reference set in the stereotactic coordinate system. The generated output had thus a spatial resolution of 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm (27 mm ). 

The statistical evaluation was based on a least-square estimation using the general linear model (GLM) for serially auto-correlated observations. Temporal Gaussian smoothing (4 s FWHM) was applied to deal with temporal autocorrelation and determine the degrees of freedom (Worsley and Friston,  ). All design matrices were generated by hemodynamic modeling using a γ-function. We conducted the analysis once using only one GLM and once more using three GLMs (triple-GLM hereafter), one for each competing contrast. In the single-GLM approach, the three contrasts were set to compete for variance in one GLM to achieve a thorough model comparison. In the triple-GLM approach, the same whole-brain analyses was conducted with three separate GLMs, in order to not underestimate the effects of the competing alternative hypotheses and give them a more liberal chance to yield potential caudate activity. The onset vectors were modeled in a time-locked event-related fashion, i.e., the duration set to one second. The first derivative was taken into the model to improve model fit for latency effects. 


### Single-GLM approach 
  
The events to account for the violation hypothesis (i) were the dancer's incorrect movements, for the other hypotheses (ii and iii) the modeled events were specific cues. Hence, the model encompassed the following event types: correct movements, incorrect movements, first dissimilar transition cues, switch cues, and repetition cues (see below). The model encompassed null events as an additional vector. The violation hypothesis (i) contrasted invalidly cued switches and invalidly cued repetitions vs. validly cued switches and validly cued repetitions. The saliency hypothesis (ii) parametrically modeled the first dissimilar transition cue after 4, 3, 2, or 1 identical transition cue(s), ascribing the highest activation level (vector amplitude) to the dissimilar successor of four cues identical to each other. (The switch cue in Table  , for example would have been assigned a vector amplitude of three; the immediately following repetition cue would have been assigned a vector amplitude of one). In addition, to discern whether potential effects would rely more on a first switch after a number of repetitions or first repetition after a number of switches, we modeled these contrasts in the same fashion of increasing vector values separately, too. That is, in one parametric contrast we ascribed a vector amplitude to each first switch according to the number of previous repetitions (saliency of switches contrast); in the other parametric contrast, the vector amplitude of each first repetition accorded to previous switches (saliency of repetitions contrast). The change hypothesis (iii) was modeled by comparing switch cues to repetition cues. Contrast images, i.e., differences of beta-value estimates for the specified conditions, were generated for each participant. All contrast images were fed into a second-level random effects analysis. The group analysis consisted of one-sample   t  -tests across all contrast images to analyze whether the observed differences between conditions were significantly deviant from 0. Acquired   t  -values were transformed to   z  -scores. To correct for false-positive results, an initial   z  -threshold was set to 2.56 (  p   < 0.05, one-tailed, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). In a second step, the results were corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level, using cluster size and cluster value thresholds that were obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations. The employed significance level was   p   = 0.05. Hence, the reported activations are significantly activated at   p   ≤ 0.05, corrected for comparison at cluster level. 


### Triple-GLM approach 
  
In the triple-GLM approach the contrasts (i–iii) were calculated from the same events as described above. However, we employed a different GLM for each contrast that encompassed only the events necessary for the contrast and null-events. The GLM for the violation contrast (i) encompassed validly cued switches, validly cues repetition, invalidly cued switches and invalidly cues repetitions, and null-events. The GLM for the saliency contrast (i) encompassed all first dissimilar cues with a vector amplitude reflecting the number of previous identical repetitions and null-events. The GLM for the change hypothesis encompassed all repetition cues and all switch cues. Group analysis and corrections were identical to the single-GLM analysis described above. 



## Results 
  
### Behavioral 
  
Fifteen of 19 volunteers passed the initial behavioral probe at the 85% criterion. All participants completed training and responded correctly to cue – sequences of up to 18 cues. In the fMRI session, 14 out of 15 participants performed to criterion, with a mean rate of 91.1% correct responses, standard deviation (SD) at 5.4%. Mean rate of correct rejections was 91.7% (SD = 7.3%) and that of hits equaled 90.5% (SD = 7.2%). A two-tailed   t  -test revealed no significant difference between the averages of hits and correct rejections. One participant had to be excluded from further analyses due to insufficient performance (below 2 SDs from mean). 



## fMRI 
  
### Single-GLM approach 
  
The contrast between movements that deviated from cue and movements that accorded to the previous cue (violation hypothesis, i) yielded significant bilateral activations in the basomedial caudate nucleus (Figure  ) and right medial pallidum, in the habenula, the anterior dorsal insula, mesial frontomedian cortex (Brodmann's area [BA] 8 and 9), lateral BA 10, and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Significant lateralized activations were found in left angular gyrus (AG), right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ; Figure  ; Table  ).

Refer to Table   for activation coordinates.

Refer to Table   for activation coordinates. 
    
 Single-GLM, violation hypothesis (i) contrast: Anatomical specification, Talairach coordinates (  x,y,z  ) and maximal   z  -scores of significantly activated voxels for prediction-violating in contrast to prediction-conform movements  . 
  
In the parametric contrasts testing for the saliency hypothesis (ii) only the contrast accounting for activity increase with the number of prior repetitions of identical movements revealed significant activation (saliency of switches contrast). This activity was in supplementary motor area (SMA) and postcentral gyrus. There were no significant correlations with the number of preceding switches. Similarly, there was no significant activation for the general saliency effect, that is number of identical transitions preceding a dissimilar transition, pooled over switches and repetitions. Contrasting switch cues with repetition cues to account for the change hypothesis (iii) yielded the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and bilaterally (anterior) IPS. Notably, there was no significant striatal activation, neither in the parametric contrasts relating to the saliency hypothesis (ii), nor in the contrast relating to change hypothesis (iii; Table  ).

### Triple-GLM approach 
  
The triple-GLM analysis was employed to calculate the same contrasts as the single-GLM analysis but from three GLMs, optimized for differential effects. This approach yielded caudate activity also only in the violation contrast (i; Table  ; Figure  ). There was no striatal activity either in the saliency (ii) or change contrast (iii). Likewise, cortical activations identified by the violation (i; Table  , Figures   and  ) contrast did not differ largely between the analogous contrasts from the single GLM vs. triple-GLM analyses. The triple-GLM analysis also revealed no significant activity for the saliency (ii) contrast. The parallel change (iii) contrasts from the two analysis approaches revealed quite similar patterns (Tables   and   for comparison). 
  
 Triple-GLM, violation hypothesis (i) contrast: main effect of movements deviating from cue vs. movements according to cue; group averaged activations are shown (at   z   > 3.09) on an axial slice (  z   = 10) of an individual brain, normalized and aligned to the Talairach stereotactic space  . Refer to Table   for activation coordinates.

## Discussion 
  
The present study set out to investigate the role of the caudate nucleus in events that violate predictions (i). In contrast to previous studies, these events were not feedback in an operant conditioning task and involved neither reinforcement nor punishment. Hence, we termed these prediction-violating events “breaches of expectation” to distinguish them from prediction errors conceived as activity dependent on (future) reception of reward. Moreover, we extended the study-design to exclude the possibility that the striatal activity could be a consequence of potential secondary characteristics of violated predictions, that is responses to salient events (ii) and events that provoke a change in behavior (iii). 

The contrast accounting for the violation hypothesis (i) yielded activation in the basomedial caudate nucleus. On the contrary, striatal activation was absent in the contrasts that accounted for the saliency (ii) or change (iii) hypotheses, even when we calculated these contrasts from separate optimized GLMs in the triple-GLM approach. This pattern of results suggests the dorsal striatum to be tuned to violations of current predictions rather than to these events’ saliency or implied incite to switch behavior. Moreover, the results show that dorso-striatal responses to violated predictions are not restricted to reinforcement or punishment protocols. 

### Caudate nucleus signals for breaches of expectation 
  
The results of the current study suggest that activity in the head of caudate nucleus signals breaches of expectation, i.e., violated predictions, more generally than previously assumed. This finding may explain why this area is often found in trial and error learning, where its activity diminishes once learning has occurred (Jueptner and Weiller,  ; Delgado et al.,  ; Shohamy et al.,  ; Ruge and Wolfensteller,  ). Trial and error learning means building up predictions what cues demand which action to gain reward. If the predictions fail, actions have to be altered. If the predictions are fulfilled, the deterministics of the task are apparently understood. Accordingly, the diminution of caudate activity over the course of learning is rooted in the fact that only as long as the rules of the task are unknown (at the beginning of learning), predictions are constantly violated, driving caudate activity. Once the rules have been established, breaches of expectation wane and so does caudate activity. The notion that a breach of expectation signal is generated in caudate nucleus could also account for impairments of Parkinson's disease patients in trial and error learning (Shohamy et al.,  ). Their compromised breach of expectation signal, due to neostriatal dysfunction, hinders updating wrong beliefs and accordingly adapting behavior. More evidence for a caudate signal for breaches of expectation comes from studies showing that caudate activity ceases the earlier, the easier it is to learn the association between cues and correct actions, i.e., the easier it is to build up operative predictions (Delgado et al.,  ; Koch et al.,  ). The same activity is persistent for cues that are non-informative, and this is for the same reasons, i.e., that they predict that either of two actions could be correct with the same probability. These cues make it impossible to establish reliable predictions (Delgado et al.,  ). 

The present findings add to these results in an important fashion, showing caudate nucleus involvement for general breaches of expectation, independent of ensuing feedback, in a movement observation paradigm. Breaches of expectation yielded caudate activity, even if the violated prediction was not a prediction on the availability of reinforcement, but only on the next movement that was to be observed. This finding of a “perceptual prediction error” (Zacks et al.,  ) stands in stark contrast to the aforementioned studies that investigated the caudate prediction error signal in relation to feedback on whether the participants had gained or lost money by their last action (Delgado et al.,  ; Koch et al.,  ; Tricomi and Fiez,  ) Moreover, as the breaches of expectation in this study reflect perceptual prediction error, it establishes that this perceptual prediction error has a neural correlate in caudate nucleus. 


### Cortical areas co-active with caudate nucleus 
  
We found a number of cortical areas co-activated for the violation contrast, including the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and the adjacent tempo-parietal junction (TPJ) extending into AG. All three cortical regions are connected to the neostriatum by the fronto-occipital fasciculus as well as by the joint fasciculus subcallosal of Muratoff (Schmahmann and Pandya,  ). This white-matter connectivity points to functionally closely interrelated areas. As the Muratoff bundle directly projects into the dorsal striatum, a fast transmission of perceived deviations to neostriatum is accounted for. Moreover, projections from the AG to caudate nucleus have recently been confirmed by diffusion-tensor imaging in humans (Uddin et al.,  ). 

With regard to this connectivity and these regions’ functions as described in the literature, the concurrent activation for the violation contrast is quite plausible. The pSTS is activated when perceiving biological motion and shows enhanced activation for movements that deviate from expectations (Keysers and Perrett,  ). Adjacent TPJ is involved in predicting the end-state of movements (Arzy et al.,  ) and also in reorienting in space (Blanke et al.,  ; Van Overwalle and Baetens,  ). Accordingly, pSTS enhancement may indicate the dissimilarity between a covert motor plan in our highly trained subjects and the actually perceived (false) movement. TPJ activation, moreover, may result from perceiving limb trajectories toward end-states that differed from the expected (or even covertly prepared) ones. The spreading of activation into AG fosters the idea put forward by other authors that TPJ, extending into AG, actually responds to breaches of expectation (Vossel et al.,  ; Shulman et al.,  ). These authors employed paradigms where a number of cues signaled where a target would appear with different probabilities. Interestingly, when a cue that indicated a high probability of a certain target position was violated, the resulting activation was higher than for the violation of less predictive cues. It therefore seems as if the more surprising an outcome is, that is, the more it violates a current prediction, the higher is the resultant AG activation (Vossel et al.,  ; Shulman et al.,  ). Besides, the aforementioned studies used abstract stimuli, but employed paradigms demanding reorienting in space (Blanke et al.,  ; Vossel et al.,  ; Shulman et al.,  ; Van Overwalle and Baetens,  ). The current study employed solely stimuli that represented human motion, but results agree with the literature that the function of reorienting of attention is related to activity in the temporo-parietal junction and posterior parietal cortex (Corbetta and Shulman,  ). Within this framework, TPJ would be reframed as “circuit breaker,” which still implies the same function of detecting a salient stimulus that deviates from expectations (Corbetta and Shulman,  ). 

It can be suggested that after transmission of the perceived violation of prediction from the temporo-parietal network to the dorsal striatum, a breach of expectation signal is provided by the dorsal striatum that incites the mediation of frontal responses (Ridderinkhof et al.,  ). The consequential frontal network comprised the mesial frontal cortex bilaterally, specifically Brodmann area 8 (BA), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), anterior dorsal insula and middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Of those, the anterior dorsal insula, ACC and mesial BA 8 have been implicated in situations characterized by uncertainty (Volz et al.,  ; Wager and Feldman,  ; Volz,  ), signifying the likelihood of errors and a need to adapt one's expectations. In the present study, participants expected to encounter events that would deviate from current predictions, but they lacked information regarding the time-point and frequency of such deviating events. Consequently, there was uncertainty toward the ruling probabilistic of the task. 

The involvement of MFG signifies the high impact the task had on working memory (Goldman-Rakic,  ; Braver et al.,  ). The participants had to judge a movement according to an auditory cue that had preceded the currently presented cue. At the same time they had to register the current cue to predict the next movement. This protocol amounts to a one-back-task. Thus, MFG may reflect active retrieval of the last cue in order to judge whether the caudate-conveyed deviation signal was meaningful or not. Engaging working memory in response to a signaled deviation accords to the assumption that in uncertain situations, PFC explores alternatively operating models (Daw et al.,  ). 


### Subcortical breach of expectation coding 
  
Apart from caudate nucleus, an important subcortical component of the activity in the violation contrast was the habenula. The habenula codes exclusively for negative prediction errors, and thus corresponds in an antagonistic fashion to the classic reward prediction error (Hikosaka et al.,  ). Unexpected positive reinforcement causes a decrease in habenula activity. Meanwhile, during punishment or reward omission the habenula shows an activity increase (Matsumoto and Hikosaka,  ). In contrast, caudate activity has been suggested to be different from both opponents in that it is increased in activity for every breach of expectation, regardless its valence (Horvitz,  ). In the present study, the violations of current predictions did not entail negative consequences. However, making a mistake during behavioral training could well have been ascribed a negative valence. We suggest that as the participants probably engaged in motor imagery to solve the task, exploiting their own memorized experiences during training, seeing the dancer deviating from the protocol was regarded an error with all negative implications (Preston and de Waal,  ; Decety and Jackson,  ; Singer et al.,  ). However, the fact that in this study the signal to violated predictions in caudate nucleus is enhanced at the same time that the habenula codes for a negative prediction error, underpins the breach of expectation nature of caudate activity. We find an activity increase for events that are not predicted in the current forward model, not a typical negative prediction error, as the corresponding habenula activity may suggest (Jocham and Ullsperger,  ). 


### Predictions, deviations, and learning 
  
In the animal literature, prediction errors are mostly described as resultant from the occurrence or omission of reward (Schultz et al.,  ), thereby related to satisfying or averse (external) stimuli. Prediction errors are defined as decreased activity in the face of omitted reward or punishment. However, the current study revealed evidence for heightened caudate activity toward violated predictions in insufficient or failing forward models, and hence breaches of expectation. Establishing predictions and especially signaling for a breach of expectation may be as important as coding how much reward (e.g., food or money) is available, or how unpredicted primary reward was (Spicer et al.,  ). The limitations of fMRI in proving neurotransmitter involvement do not allow drawing the inference that this caudate activity was based in a dopaminergic response (Düzel et al.,  ). The dopaminergic innervation of the dorsal striatum (see Joel and Weiner,   #197 for a review) and the response of the habenula (Jocham and Ullsperger,  ) implicate the dopaminergic system, but further studies are needed to decide whether dopamine is involved in not reward related breaches of expectation. New approaches, especially the free-energy principle (Friston,  ) stress the value of predictive capability   per se  , i.e., the ability to detect breaches of expectation (Kiebel et al.,  ; Suddendorf et al.,  ; Friston,  ). This model regards correct predictions as prerequisite for successful interaction with the environment, because recognizing a situation and acting accordingly is a capability owed to the disposal of valid forward models (Kiebel et al.,  ). The according actions may be to the end of satisfying primary needs or an evolved want. A typical aim in a social interaction would be, e.g., to adhere to the arrangement and to the task instruction in an fMRI study that were formerly mutually agreed upon. Operative forward models themselves can be valuable enough to be perceived as rewarding, even though they do not yield primary reward or reinforcement. Consider, for example, the psychological importance of a sense of control. In learned-helplessness paradigms, where animals are not able to predict and avoid punishment, pseudo-depression is a consequence (Seligman and Maier,  ). Unpredictability is just another facet of non-operative forward-models. To establish operative forward models, breaches of expectation must be registered. If they cease to occur, this can be regarded as evidence that learning, i.e., model adaptation, was sufficient. The sense of accomplishment that goes with feeling in control of a situation provides indeed a powerful motivation to learn. Taken together, breaches of expectation that allow for the generation and improvement of an internal model are of utmost importance to survival, but also psychological wellbeing. 



## Conclusion 
  
The results of the current study foster the idea that the caudate nucleus signals for occurrence of events that violate the predictions of the operative forward model. This signal is not due to the perception of salient events or the need to change one's behavior, and it is not based on direct reinforcement or punishment. Frontal activation that we observed may be triggered by this signal from the caudate nucleus and operate to deal with present altered environmental demands; either via update of the current forward model or via assessment of the probability of certain event alternatives.

# Abstract
 
A common approach used to fuse simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI is to correlate trial-by-trial variability in the EEG, or variability of components derived therefrom, with the blood oxygenation level dependent response. When this correlation is done using the conventional univariate approach, for example with the general linear model, there is the usual problem of correcting the statistics for multiple comparisons. Cluster thresholding is often used as the correction of choice, though in many cases it is utilized in an   ad hoc   way, for example by employing the same cluster thresholds for both traditional regressors (stimulus or behaviorally derived) and EEG-derived regressors. In this paper we describe a resampling procedure that takes into account the   a priori   statistics of the trial-to-trial variability of the EEG-derived regressors in a way that trades off cluster size and maximum voxel   Z  -score to properly correct for multiple comparisons. We show that this data adaptive procedure improves sensitivity for smaller clusters of activation, without sacrificing the specificity of the results. Our results suggest that extra care is needed in correcting statistics when the regressor model is derived from noisy and/or uncertain measurements, as is the case for regressors constructed from single-trial variations in the EEG.

## Introduction 
  
It is becoming increasingly common to use single-trial EEG-derived values to model simultaneously acquired fMRI data. The combination of these two complementary neuroimaging modalities enables the variability of neural activity to be related to the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response (e.g., Debener et al.,  ; Benar et al.,  ; Goldman et al.,  ). Particularly exciting is that this type of fusion of modalities exploits variability that is not observable via behavioral responses, and thus provides a window into latent states of the human brain. 

Many efforts combining simultaneous EEG and fMRI in this way employ the general linear model (GLM; Worsley and Friston,  ). The GLM is a univariate approach which, when applied to massive datasets such as fMRI, requires correcting the statistics for multiple comparisons in order to properly perform hypothesis testing. The issue of multiple comparison correction has been addressed extensively in the literature and there are a number of procedures that have been adopted, both for fMRI analysis alone (Genovese et al.,  ; Nichols and Hayasaka,  ) and for simultaneous EEG/fMRI (Debener et al.,  ; Eichele et al.,  ; Benar et al.,  ; Esposito et al.,  ; Goldman et al.,  ; Mayhew et al.,  ; Mulert et al.,  ; Scheibe et al.,  ; Novitskiy et al.,  ). 

One concern that is specific to using the variability of EEG-derived regressors is the added uncertainty in the “interpretation” of the resulting statistics within the context of statistical parametric maps. This can be easily seen if we consider the sources of uncertainty for different types of regressors. In conventional fMRI, regressors might be constructed based on the timing of the stimulus presented to the subject (see Figure  A). We know the times exactly and we have reason to believe that these times are relevant to the activity in the brain. The amplitudes of the regressor events are constant so there is no uncertainty in terms of their magnitude – i.e., a constant scale would not change the GLM analysis. We could also construct regressors derived from behavioral measures, such as response time (RT), and though this may vary across trial and subject, we can measure RTs very accurately and thus measurement noise is low. However there is additional uncertainty in the interpretation of the amplitude variations. For example a long RT (e.g., high amplitude on a trial) might be caused by attentional lapses, natural alertness fluctuations, or additional neural processing for increasing decision confidence. Thus, compared to the case in Figure  A, the behavioral regressor in Figure  B could be seen as having greater uncertainty. 
  
 Sources of uncertainty in different regressor models  . Shown are three regressor types (before convolution with the hemodynamic response function).   (A)   Regressor constructed from the onset times of the stimulus. The high certainty in this type of regressor is a result of stimulus times being set by the experiment and measured exactly. There is no uncertainty in the interpretation of amplitudes since they are constant.   (B)   Regressor constructed by modulating the stimulus onset times by response times (RTs). Measurement noise of RTs is low (i.e., RTs are high SNR measurements) however there is additional uncertainty (relative to case   A  ) in terms of the interpretation of the trial-by-trial variations in response time.   (C)   Regressor constructed by modulating stimulus by activity derived from electrophysiological variability. Sources of uncertainty include both measurement noise, due to the low SNR of the signal, as well as the interpretation of the trial-to-trial electrophysiological variability. 
  
When constructing regressors derived from EEG variability (Figure  C), we must consider a number of factors affecting our uncertainty. One is related to the noise in the measurements – i.e., EEG has roughly a −20 dB signal to noise ratio (SNR; Parra et al.,  ). Thus we have measurement noise that is greater than for the cases seen in Figures  A,B. Secondly, there is the interpretation of the meaning of the EEG-derived variability. We might hypothesize that the variability relates to attentional modulation, workload, perceived error strength, etc., but this too is a hypothesis with its own noise/uncertainty – similar to the issue for the RT derived regressor of Figure  B. 

In order to take the uncertainty in the prior into account, we could resample from the prior distribution to construct our null hypothesis (H0). There are many ways to resample or bootstrap (e.g., for a review of techniques in signal processing see (Zoubir and Iskander,  ). One of the simplest is to draw samples from a distribution of the noise by permuting or randomizing the EEG-derived variability. In previous work we used a simple resampling procedure to compute cluster thresholds for correcting for multiple comparisons (Goldman et al.,  ). However this method for estimating a cluster size threshold was limited because it sacrificed sensitivity for overly conservative specificity. Here we expand this work to a more exhaustive search of the parameter spaces by developing a better representation of the relationship between characteristics of the data. This enables us to maintain both sensitivity and specificity over a range of cluster sizes. 

We present these results for two such characteristics: cluster size and maximum   z  -score within a cluster. We use the relationship between them to correct for multiple comparisons by trading-off   z  -score for cluster size. Specifically, we propose a resampling technique, adapted to the noise distribution of the single-trial EEG-derived regressors, that enables increased sensitivity by identifying significance values that are a joint function of cluster size and maximum   z  -score – i.e., enables us to construct the null hypothesis H0 and set a joint threshold to test significance. This approach increases sensitivity by allowing smaller clusters having higher   z  -score, while maintaining specificity. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
The data used in this study are taken from Goldman et al. ( ). Detailed methods of subjects, paradigm, data acquisition, and single-trial analysis are given there (Goldman et al.,  ). In brief, simultaneous EEG and fMRI data were acquired for 11 healthy normal subjects (six female, mean age 31, range 25–38) during an auditory oddball paradigm. Informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the guidelines and approval of the Columbia University Institutional Review Board. 

Subjects listened to standard (frequency 350 Hz, probability of occurrence 0.8) and oddball tones (frequency 500 Hz, probability of occurrence 0.2). Subjects were instructed to respond with a button press to the target oddball tone. There were a total of 50 target and 200 standard trials for each subject. 

EEG was acquired simultaneously with fMRI using a custom-built MR-compatible system using 36 bipolar twisted pair electrodes sampled at 1 kHz (Goldman et al.,  ; Sajda et al.,  ) in a 1.5-T scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, WA, USA). Whole brain functional EPI data were acquired with 15 axial slices (TE = 50 ms; TR = 3000 ms; matrix = 64 × 64 voxels, 3.125 mm in-plane resolution, 8 mm thickness). EEG pre-processing included a 0.5-Hz high-pass filter, 60 and 120 Hz notch filters, and gradient artifact removal (mean subtraction as well as 10 ms median filter). BCG artifacts were removed by principal component analysis (PCA) by first estimating the principal components on data after high-pass filtering at 4 Hz and then applying these estimates to the original EEG. The EEG data was epoched into trials in two ways: stimulus-locked (SL, aligned to the onset of the tone) and response-locked (RL, for the target tones, they were aligned to the subject's button press and for the standard tones they were randomly chosen from the RT distribution of the target tones). Individual subject single-trial analysis of EEG was then performed via logistic regression to discriminate between the EEG responses to two classes of stimuli (targets and standards) within consecutive 50 ms training windows. The output of this process is a discriminating component,   y  , specific to that trial and discriminating window, where   y   represents the distance to the discriminating hyperplane (Parra et al.,  ;  ; Goldman et al.,  ). The amplitudes of the resulting discriminating components within the training window for each SL and RL window were then used to model the BOLD response on a single-trial basis. Figure   illustrates our approach, mapping from trial-to-trial variability in EEG components to fMRI regressors (in this case using time windows of 200 and 350 ms post-stimulus).

Note that the event timing for each of the two windows is the same, but the event amplitudes are different. A separate fMRI analysis is run for each window, using that window's single-trial output to model single-trial variability. Figure from Goldman et al. ( ). 
  
### Resampling 
  
Our goal in the resampling was to maintain the overall distributions of the EEG discriminating components (  y  -values) for target and standard trials while removing the specific trial-to-trial correlations in the individual experimental runs. To this end, we constructed two empirical distributions (one for “target   y  -values” and one for “standard   y  -values”) by pooling the   y  -values for each condition across all subjects and runs. To best demonstrate the contribution of the trial-to-trial variability, we constructed our empirical distributions using   y  -values from only behaviorally correct trials and computed from a time window (450 ms SL) which yielded both substantial discrimination in the EEG (across subject, average Az > 0.75; Figure 2 in Goldman et al.,  ) as well as significant correlation in the fMRI (  p   < 0.005 and cluster corrected for comparison of <73 voxels; Figure   in Goldman et al.,  ). 

Given these empirical distributions, we constructed a “resampled run” by taking the ordered vector of targets and standard trials (250 trials per subject, with 50 targets and 200 standards intermixed) and drew randomly, without replacement, from the distribution corresponding to the label of that trial. Thus for a resampled run, all trials were drawn from the distribution with the correct “label” (target or standard) however the specific   y  -value was mixed between trials, runs and subjects. All subjects had the same resampled run   y  -values for a given iteration, though the resulting regressors for each subject were different given that the each had a random sequence of target and standard trials. This entire procedure was repeated 100 times, yielding 100 resamplings of the entire data set (run, subject, group). These procedures allowed us to construct the null hypothesis H0, and establish a joint threshold on cluster size and max   z  -score (see below). 


### fMRI analysis 
  
For each of the 100 resampled iterations, a full three-level analysis (run, subject, group) was performed. Standard fMRI pre-processing was performed: slice-timing correction, motion correction, spatial smoothing at 8 mm full-width at half-maximum, and high-pass filtering at 0.01 Hz. Our design matrix included 11 regressors, six of which related to the degrees of motion correction. Of the remaining five regressors (which were convolved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function), two were a traditional event-related model of target and standard tones (onset at the time of stimulus presentation, duration 100 ms, amplitude of 1), one represented the RTs (with onset at the time of stimulus presentation, duration 100 ms, amplitude corresponding to RT), and the final two regressors modeled the amplitude variability of the single-trial discriminating component (onset time at window time, duration 100 ms, amplitude given by the single-trial EEG discriminator   y  -value) and were orthogonalized to the traditional target and standard regressors. These single-trial regressors allowed us to examine the BOLD signal related to the variation in the resampled single-trial EEG discriminating component values. Specifically, we looked at the cluster outputs from the resampled single-trial target and standard regressors. 


### One-dimensional thresholds 
  
All clusters that exceeded minimal thresholds [cluster size of 2 and   z  -score of 2.57 (per voxel   p   = 0.005)] from all 100 iterations were assembled for both positive and negative correlations for the resampled single-trial targets. Two characteristics of the resampled data were obtained: cluster size (number of voxels) and   z  -score (maximum value in cluster). The resampled data were sorted and thresholds were established based on the top 5% and top 1%. Canonical thresholds were also used: 10 voxel cluster size and 2.57   z  -score. The results from the analysis of single-trial simultaneous EEG/fMRI from Goldman et al. ( ) were overlaid to examine those clusters that exceeded each of these thresholds. 


### Constructing joint thresholds 
  
We developed an approach for increasing the sensitivity for smaller cluster sizes by constructing a significance threshold based on the joint distribution of cluster size and maximum   z  -score. Our approach was to identify a joint distribution, based on these two measures, that showed a strong positive linear correlation which could be used to construct a one-dimensional projection for thresholding which was a function of both dimensions. We found that the log cluster size versus 1 − (maximum   p  -value in the cluster) resulted in a strong linear fit (Pearson's correlation coefficient   r   = 0.88) for all resampled clusters that exceeded the minimal thresholds [cluster size of 2 and   z  -score of 2.57 (per voxel   p   = 0.005)]. The projections of the resampled activations along this linear regression were sorted to obtain the maximal 5 and 1%. Significance thresholds (  p   = 0.05 and 0.01) were defined by orthogonal projections from this linear fit of the resampled activations. The results from the analysis of single-trial simultaneous EEG/fMRI from Goldman et al. ( ) were overlaid to examine those clusters that exceeded both of these thresholds. 



## Results 
  
### Statistics 
  
There were 655 clusters with a per-voxel   p   < 0.005 that survived the minimum cluster threshold of two voxels in the resampled analysis. The mean cluster size was 14 voxels with a standard deviation of 18. The mean   z  -score within these clusters was 2.8 and the standard deviation was 0.14. The clusters from the resampled analysis were overlaid onto a standard MNI template brain volume to ensure that clusters of activation from resampling came from regions throughout the brain and did not represent the same cluster (data not shown). 


### Cluster size threshold 
  
We examined the distribution of cluster sizes (number of voxels) for the resampled data and used these data to establish adaptive thresholds. The largest 1% (  n   = 6 of 655) of the resampled data had a cluster size that exceeded 94 voxels. The largest 5% (  n   = 32 of 655) of the resampled data clusters had a cluster size that exceeded 50 voxels. These thresholds were then applied to the clusters observed in the original data, which represent regions where BOLD signal correlated with either SL or RL single-trial EEG variability. The relationship between the resampled and original data is depicted in Figure  . This figure indicates that there were only three clusters from the original data that exceeded the   p   < 0.01 resampled significance threshold of 94 voxels. Further, these three clusters were the only ones that exceeded the   p   < 0.05 resampled significance threshold of 50 voxels. Two of those activations were seen in the right lateral occipital cortex (Table  , clusters 1 and 2). One cluster was found in the left postcentral gyrus (Table  , cluster 3). Twenty-six percent (22 of 85) of the original clusters exceeded a canonical 10 voxel threshold. Thirty-seven percent (244 of 655) of the resampled clusters exceeded that canonical 10 voxel threshold.

Three significance thresholds are presented: 10 voxel canonical cluster threshold (black solid line),   p   = 0.05 resampled significance threshold (red solid line), and   p   = 0.01 resampled significance threshold (yellow solid line). Horizontal dashed lines show the cluster sizes of the original data from Goldman et al. ( ), both those below (green) and the three clusters that exceed (yellow) the resampled cluster size significance threshold (  p   < 0.01).

 Index is a number to uniquely identify the cluster for later reference. Cluster size is given in number of voxels. For the one-dimensional thresholds, the background color (yellow, p < 0.01; red, p < 0.05) indicates if the cluster was significant in the corresponding column. For the joint threshold, the background color in the 1 − p-value column indicates the significance. Cluster location is given by hemisphere (R, right; L, left), location of the peak z-score (x, y, z in MNI space), and brain region. Also shown for each cluster is the direction of correlation between single-trial regressor and BOLD signal (−, +), Az value for the single-trial window, whether the window was locked to stimulus onset or response time, and the window onset time in milliseconds  . 
  

### Max Z-score threshold 
  
We also plotted the distribution of maximum   z  -scores (the peak value within the clusters) for the resampled data and used these to establish adaptive thresholds. The upper 1% of the resampled data clusters had a   z  -score that exceeded 3.17, and the upper 5% had a   z  -score that exceeded 3.01. These thresholds were then applied to the   z  -scores from the original data. The relationship between the resampled and original data is depicted in Figure  . This figure indicates one cluster that exceeds the   p   < 0.01 resampled significance threshold of   z   = 3.17. This cluster was located in the right lateral occipital cortex (Table  , cluster 1). The figure also indicates three additional clusters that exceed the   p   < 0.05 resampled significance threshold   z   = 3.01. These clusters were located in the right lateral occipital cortex (Table  , cluster 2), and bilaterally in the amygdala (Table  , clusters 4 and 5).

Horizontal dashed lines of the   z  -scores of the original data are overlaid (in green). Three significance thresholds are shown:   z   = 2.57 threshold (black),   p   = 0.05 resampled significance threshold (red), and   p   = 0.01 resampled significance threshold (yellow). The dashed lines of the four clusters from the original data of Goldman et al. ( ), that exceed significance thresholds are colored accordingly: three for which   p   < 0.05 (red) and one for which   p   < 0.01 (yellow). 
  

### Joint thresholds 
  
The relationship between cluster size (log scale) and 1 − (  p  -value) for the resampled and original data is depicted in Figure  . The linear regression visualizes the first principal component of the resampled data (  n   = 655). Significance values (  p   < 0.05 and <0.01) were determined by the projections to the regression line of the 32nd and 6th largest resampled data clusters along this first principal component. Significance thresholds, the orthogonal projections from regression line, intersected for   p   < 0.05 at a cluster size of 52 and a 1 −   p  -value of 0.998 [  x   = (52,0.998)] and for   p   < 0.01 at a cluster size of 88 and a 1 −   p  -value of 0.999 [  x   = (88,0.999)]. Two clusters from the original data exceeded   p   < 0.01 significance (clusters 1 and 2) and three additional clusters exceeded   p   < 0.05 significance (clusters 3, 4, and 5).

Shown are scatter plots of cluster size versus   p  -value of the resampled data (blue open circles) and the original data of Goldman et al. ( ; green filled circles). Two joint significance thresholds are shown:   p   = 0.05 resampled significance threshold (red), and   p   = 0.01 resampled significance threshold (yellow). Those clusters from the original data that exceed the joint significance thresholds are colored accordingly. 
  


## Discussion 
  
Simultaneously acquired EEG and fMRI data offers the potential to investigate neural states with temporal and spatial precision that is not afforded by either method alone. However, while in traditional event-related fMRI the model is known with high certainty, explanatory variables defined by a measured quantity such as EEG introduce more uncertainty into the model. While it is becoming increasingly common to acquire multi-modal data, as yet there is no generally agreed upon method for analysis or interpretation of this data that takes the uncertainty of the model into account. 

In this study, we used the data from Goldman et al. ( ), in which the single-trial variability derived from the EEG was used to construct BOLD fMRI regressors, to illustrate a resampling method for determining significance in single-trial EEG/fMRI data. With this method, we can correct for multiple comparisons by adaptively resampling the noise distribution of the EEG-derived regressors. This resampling method demonstrated an interaction between activated cluster size and local maximum   z  -score and showed that the joint distribution of the size of activation clusters and the maximum   z  -score found in the cluster can be used to establish significance thresholds that provide a proper trade-off of sensitivity and specificity. Principled methods for trading-off spatial extent and individual voxel statistical significance were originally proposed for use in neuroimaging by Poline et al. ( ). 

Figure   graphically summarizes the results from Table   and also illustrates the improved sensitivity we obtained using the joint threshold method. Compared to the results in Goldman et al. ( ), these results show additional significant correlations in areas that overlap with the amygdala. Though this current paper is meant as a statistical methods paper and is not aimed at re-evaluating the specific findings of Goldman et al. ( ), it is worth noting that the responses in the amygdala have been observed, intracranially, for activity associated with P300 timing and polarity (Halgren et al.,  ). 
  
 Significant clusters (yellow,   p   < 0. 01; red,   p   < 0.05) overlaid on axial slices of an MNI template brain image  . Each row corresponds to a different thresholding technique derived from our resampling tests:   (A)   cluster size only based threshold,   (B)   maximum   z  -score based threshold,   (C)   joint threshold. Sampled slices not shown (slices sampled every 6 mm) had no significant clusters for any of the thresholding techniques. See Table   for additional information on these clusters. 
  
Projection of the data onto the first principal component of this distribution allows us to simply compute a joint threshold for a one-sided significance level. One might ask “why not use the full distribution instead of the projection on the first principle component?” For example, one might imagine trying to empirically construct a one-sided multivariate test of significance by constructing contours of fixed probability mass about the mean and then utilize the contour cutoff so that an increase in single-voxel significance always yields a decrease in voxel size, and vice versa. Though such a procedure seems to be even more powerful than simply looking at the one-dimensional projection, it comes with the following disadvantages/costs. First it requires a parametric representation of the joint distribution so as to determine the shape of the contours and secondly it requires substantially more resampling to identify the contour/boundary and/or fit the parametric distributions if modeling the data. Since the distribution in Figure   does not appear to be well-modeled by a multivariate normal, we chose to illustrate our procedure with the simplest method which maintains the key points and findings of the approach. 

Our focus has been on a data adaptive approach to correct for multiple comparisons in the joint space of single-voxel   p  -value and cluster size. Cluster size thresholding has been a popular method for correcting for multiple comparisons in EEG/fMRI, but often these thresholds are selected   ad hoc   and then propagate in the literature, used by others with little statistical justification (e.g., see Scheibe et al.,  ). There are of course other data adaptive approaches that can be used to correct for multiple comparisons and are not based on using cluster-size. One of the more recently adopted techniques controls the false-discovery rate (FDR; Genovese et al.,  ; Nichols and Hayasaka,  ), namely the expected ratio of false positives to true positives. The FDR is data adaptive in that the thresholds are inherently linked to the signal to noise in the data. FDR correction methods are easily interpretable and are computationally efficient, compared to the resampling procedure we describe here. However, FDR usually does not take into account any prior model or certainty about the regressor model and requires some assumptions about the structure of the noise distribution. FDR correction methods are none-the-less an attractive approach for multiple comparison correction and more work is needed to understand how they can best be employed in EEG/fMRI data analysis. 


## Conclusion 
  
In summary, our results suggest that additional care is required when using cluster-size to correct for multiple comparisons and determine significance in EEG/fMRI data. Some groups use conservative thresholds (Goldman et al.,  ) while others use cutoffs that are more lenient (Debener et al.,  ; Benar et al.,  ; Mayhew et al.,  ; Scheibe et al.,  ). Conservative cluster thresholds reduce false positives, but they also limit the sensitivity of single-trial analysis. The resampling method proposed here suggests that standard   ad hoc   cluster size thresholds, for example of 10 voxels, are too lenient (at least in this case) since more than a third of the resampled data clusters were found to have a larger size. For this data, a more conservative threshold of 50 voxels, as determined by the variability in the data itself, is a better estimate of the true data significance. This is less conservative than the threshold (of 73) presented in Goldman et al. ( ) that was derived from a less expansive bootstrapping method. In any case, our results suggest that establishing statistical significance using a threshold criteria that has been used in another EEG/fMRI study may not be adequate. Instead these corrections are better off left to be data adaptive, and though this can be computationally expensive, it improves interpretation of the results and properly establishes statistical significance.

# Title

It's not what you say but the way that you say it: an fMRI study of differential lexical and non-lexical prosodic pitch processing

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
This study aims to identify the neural substrate involved in prosodic pitch processing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to test the premise that prosody pitch processing is primarily subserved by the right cortical hemisphere. 

Two experimental paradigms were used, firstly pairs of spoken sentences, where the only variation was a single internal phrase pitch change, and secondly, a matched condition utilizing pitch changes within analogous tone-sequence phrases. This removed the potential confounder of lexical evaluation. fMRI images were obtained using these paradigms. 


## Results 
  
Activation was significantly greater within the right frontal and temporal cortices during the tone-sequence stimuli relative to the sentence stimuli. 


## Conclusion 
  
This study showed that pitch changes, stripped of lexical information, are mainly processed by the right cerebral hemisphere, whilst the processing of analogous, matched, lexical pitch change is preferentially left sided. These findings, showing hemispherical differentiation of processing based on stimulus complexity, are in accord with a 'task dependent' hypothesis of pitch processing.

## Background 
  
Non-verbal components of language, included under the collective term prosody, play a central role in human communication [ ]. First defined by Monrad-Krohn in 1947 [ ], prosodic elements of speech can be subdivided into the two broad categories of linguistic and emotional prosody. Linguistic prosody conveys information about semantic meaning, such as pragmatic category - e.g. determining if a sentence is a statement, a question or a command - and syntactic relation - e.g. determining clause boundaries within sentences [ , ]. Emotional prosody is the mechanism by which humans convey attitudes and emotions in speech. There has been debate about how clearly these two categories can be delineated. 

Initial behavioural and lesion studies implicated both right [ - ] and left [ - ] hemispheric regions, likely confounded both by the inherent difficulties in comparing lesion studies [ , ] and assessing ""global"" prosodic function without considering specific subcomponents. 

PET data first suggested that prosodic content and judgement activated the prefrontal cortex bilaterally [ , ], more so on the left, and hemispheric asymmetry has been demonstrated for most regions of activation [ ]. Subsequent imaging studies have implicated right superior temporal regions [ , - ] - most recent work suggesting particularly within Brodmann's area [ ], with additional, partially bilateral responses within the frontal cortex [ , , - ], the anterior insula [ , , ], amygdalae [ ], and the basal ganglia [ , ]. Emotional speech produces greater cortical activation than that which is prosodically neutral [ , , ]. Electrophysiological work has supported neuroimaging findings that the right temporal cortex displays enhanced event-related potentials to emotional stimuli [ ]. 

Variations in results, due in no small part to different experimental paradigms, have failed to definitively clarify whether cerebral regional and hemispheric activation are specific to prosodic subcomponent analysis or the functional demand of the task, known as the   cue dependent   [ , ] and   task dependent   [ , - ] hypotheses respectively. 

However by far the majority of work has been on emotional prosody, and it's unclear how well such data can be applied to linguistic prosody that, in comparison, has had a paucity of research. Furthermore, work on linguistic or semantic aspects of prosody have typically focused on psychometric measures of language conceptualisation and understanding [ , ] rather than the underlying neurobiology. Most authors have recognized the difficulties of the confounding influences of the lexical content of the stimuli and the problem of the higher level cognitive processes involved in the more global process of emotional prosody [ ]. 

The neuroimaging data that exist for linguistic prosody typically favour hemispheric specialisation [ ], with left fronto-temporal regions subserving 'simpler' short [ ] syntactic and lexical segments of speech [ ], and right hemispheric analogues processing larger suprasegmental elements at a sentence level [ ], most in keeping with the task dependent hypothesis. 

In light of this, this study set out to utilise fMRI to examine a single crucial element of linguistic prosodic comprehension; pitch change. We specifically looked at   internal pitch changes  , or ""emphasis shift"", as our earlier work suggested that these were more sensitive markers of subtle neurological deficits and less confounded by working memory primacy and recency phenomena [ ]. As the name suggests, internal pitch changes occur   within   - as opposed to at the beginning or end of - a sentence. Furthermore, in an effort to try eliminate the major confounder of lexical comprehension, following the work of Patel et al [ ] we introduced an analogous tone-sequence paradigm that contained a delexicalised pitch pattern. By removing the lexical content but keeping the tone sequence otherwise matched this design would also allow testing of the validity of the task dependent hypothesis as the same prosodic element, pitch, was being tested, but at different levels, with the tone sequence involving suprasegmental data analysis. 

We hypothesised that a) there are common cortical regions including bilateral prefrontal and temporal cortices associated with pitch processing in both speech and tone-sequence analogues; b) the more ""pure"" pitch processing associated with tone-sequence analogues would preferentially recruit right sided frontal and temporal cortices while more lexically loaded speech would preferentially recruit left temporal cortex; and c) increasing demands on prosodic comprehension would be associated with enhanced activation in the right frontal and temporal cortex. 


## Methods 
  
### Subjects 
  
Twelve subjects were recruited through advertisements in a city-wide newspaper. Inclusion criteria were: males aged between 18 and 55, right-handedness, English as a first language. Exclusion criteria were: previous psychiatric or neurological illness, hearing or speech impairment and illicit drug use in the previous six months. All subjects provided written informed consent. Mean age was 31 (SD = 9.6). All subjects had completed secondary education; none had any formal training in playing musical instruments. The study had been approved by the local ethics committee. 


### Stimuli and materials 
  
A modified version of the tone-sequence and prosody discrimination task previously described by the authors [ ] was used, based on the earlier protocol of Patel et al [ ]. The recorded stimuli consisted of 12 lexically identical sentence pairs, spoken by an adult female native English speaker, and their non-verbal, tone-sequence analogue pairs; and 12 sentence and tone-sequence pairs that differed prosodically in internal pitch pattern on a single word or tone (e.g. ""I like blue ties on gentlemen"" and ""I like   blue   ties on gentlemen"", with the italicized word emphasised). Tone-sequence stimuli were created by digitizing each sentence at 40,000 Hz with subsequent normalization to the same amplitude into a tone sequence which corresponded with the sentence's fundamental frequency in pitch and timing, with one level-pitch tone per syllable; a more detailed description is available in Patel et al [ ]. An alternative method of low-pass filtering of the sentence pairs to remove lexical information was felt to be less satisfactory, as such filtering can leave residual phonological information, and previous studies [ ] had validated this method. 


### Procedure 
  
Subjects were trained on the prosodic discrimination task, which consisted of six counterbalanced blocks. Each block was composed of twelve trials comprising four pairs of sentences, four pairs of tone-sequences, and four null trials (a silent period equal in length to four paired stimuli) presented in random order. Each trial consisted of a pair of stimuli separated by a one second interval. The pair of stimuli differed in the pitch of an internal component in 50% of trials. As some sentences were longer than others, the duration of the stimuli varied from 3432-6134 milliseconds, with an average length of 5036 ms. Following a visual cue at the end of each trial, subjects indicated whether the paired stimuli were the same or different by using their right index finger and a button press. There was a variable intertrial interval of between 8.6-11.3 seconds before the onset of the next trial. Such a jittered design results in peristimulus distribution of MRI sampling, thus ensuring that all components of an event-related haemodynamic response are sampled, and avoids that bias of having stimulus presentation and data acquisition time-locked [ ]. The total length of the six counterbalanced blocks was 17 minutes 39 seconds. 


### fMRI Acquisition 
  
Gradient echo echoplanar imaging (EPI) data were acquired on a neuro-optimised GE Signa 1.5 Tesla system (General Electric, Milwaukee WI, USA) at the Maudsley Hospital, London. A quadrature birdcage headcoil was used for radio frequency transmission and reception. Foam padding was placed around the subject's head in the coil to minimize head movement. One hundred and forty four T2*-weighted whole-brain volumes depicting blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast were acquired at each of 24 near-axial non-contiguous planes parallel to the intercommissural (AC-PC) line (slice thickness = 5 mm; gap = 0.5 mm; TR = 2.1 seconds; echo time = 40 milliseconds; flip angle = 90°; matrix = 64 × 64). This EPI data set provided complete brain coverage. At the same session, a high-resolution gradient echo image of the whole brain was acquired in the intercommissural plane consisting of 43 slices (slice thickness = 3 mm; gap = 0.3 mm; TR = 3 seconds; flip angle = 90°; matrix = 128 × 128). 

Scanner noise during stimuli presentation was minimised by using a partially silent acquisition [ ] during the stimuli presentation lasting 6.3 seconds while fMRI data (associated with prominent scanner noise) was collected during the following 8.4 seconds. 


### fMRI Analysis 
  
The data were first realigned [ ] to minimise motion related artefacts and smoothed using a Gaussian filter (FWHM 7.2 mm). Responses to the experimental paradigm were then detected by time-series analysis using Gamma variate functions (peak responses at 4 and 8 sec) to model the BOLD response. The analysis was implemented as follows. First, in each experimental condition, trial onsets were modelled as stick-functions which were convolved separately with the 4 and 8 sec Poisson functions to yield two regressors of the expected haemodynamic response to that condition. The weighted sum of these two convolutions that gave the best fit (least-squares) to the time series at each voxel was then computed and a goodness of fit statistic was computed at each voxel, the SSQratio. It has been shown that this permutation method gives very good type I error control with minimal distributional assumptions [ ]. 

In order to extend inference to the group level, the observed and randomized SSQratio maps were transformed into standard space by a two stage process involving first a rigid body transformation of the fMRI data into a high-resolution inversion recovery image of the same subject followed by an affine transformation onto a Talairach template [ ]. In order to increase sensitivity and reduce the multiple comparison problem encountered in fMRI, hypothesis testing was carried out at the cluster level using the method developed by Bullmore et al. [ ], shown to give excellent cluster-wise type I error control in functional fMRI analysis. All analyses were performed with < 1 false positive clusters expected per image, under the null hypothesis. 

We examined regions of activation common to both sentence and tone-sequence prosodic comprehension with conjunction analysis. As the levels of activation in the various experiments will vary, the statistical issue is whether the minimum level of activation in any of the tasks is significantly different from zero. In parametric analysis this is done by testing the minimum t statistic. The statistical analysis program utilized (XBAM) found which task had the smallest median level of activation and tested this median against the null distribution of the activation by estimating the SSQratio for each subject at each voxel for each task [ , ]. Then we compared prosodic comprehension between the tone-sequence and sentence stimuli to clarify the effects of lexical processing. Subsequent analyses compared identical stimuli pairs with differing stimuli pairs (same versus different stimuli pairs). During the pilot phase, volunteers subjectively reported the appraisal of identical stimuli to be more demanding. This was used to examine the effects of postulated increased demand on prosodic assessment. We employed a 2 × 2 factorial design to examine the interaction of factor condition (tone sequence, sentence) with the variables of pair type (same, different). The SSQ values were extracted from whole clusters, and plotted for regions demonstrating significant interaction effects between tone sequence and sentence processing and task demand assessed by same or differing stimuli pairs. 

A confounder in all fMRI studies is the intrinsic scanner noise: this is particularly the case in tasks with an auditory component such as this one. We minimized this by having the scanner at a partially silent acquisition phase [ ] during the presentation of stimuli. It has been shown that handedness and gender may affect the neural structures involved in the processing of language [ ] and prosody [ ], as such we only examined right handed males. 

Behavioural data were analyzed using the statistical package SPSS. 



## Results 
  
### Behavioural data 
  
There were no significant differences in response time or accuracy rates between sentence and tone-sequence categories either overall, or when analysed in the subcategories of   same   and   different   tasks, using a two tailed t-test (α = 0.05). The subjects were generally highly accurate (0.75 - 0.98 on the tone-sequence task, 0.83 - 1.00 on the sentence task), with four individuals getting 100% accuracy on the sentence task, suggestive of a possible ceiling effect. However, subjects were more accurate during   same   tasks (mean accuracy 0.948) than during   different   tasks (mean accuracy 0.866) overall. 


### Neuroimaging data 
  
The conjunction analysis showed significant activation common to both sentence and tone sequence prosodic processing in the bilateral Inferior Frontal Gyri, Middle (MTG) and Superior Temporal Gyri (STG), in addition to bilateral Inferior Parietal lobule and the right Superior Frontal Gyrus (Figure  ; Table  ).

## Discussion and Conclusions 
  
As hypothesized, there was activation in bilateral MTG and STG common to prosodic pitch processing across both sentence and tone-sequence stimuli. There was more prominent right inferior frontal cortex activation, although left inferior frontal activation was also present (Figure  ; Table  ). This was in accordance with previous imaging data of prosodic comprehension [ , , - ]. There was a large bilateral activation in the Inferior Parietal Lobule, a region associated with storage within the working memory system [ ]. Such a role is in accordance with our data, as differential activation maps fail to show differences in parietal activation between the two tasks, coinciding with a purely working memory role. Left precentral and postcentral gyral and basal ganglia activity were common to both conditions, something which would be anticipated in an experimental paradigm involving a right handed finger press. 

Comparison between the tone-sequence and sentence stimuli aimed to clarify the relative contribution of cortical regions associated with a purer linguistic prosodic pitch analysis (tone sequence > sentences) and those associated with greater lexical or phonological analysis (sentence > tone sequence), which has been recognised as a major confounder in such studies generally [ , - ]. Stripped of this lexical information, the tone-sequence demonstrated significant activation in the   right   inferior and medial frontal, and right STG compared to the sentence task (Figure  , bottom half; Table  ). Wildgruber et al [ ] suggested that at lower levels of both linguistic and emotional prosody processing, the same right hemispheric network is accessed but that the explicit judgment of linguistic aspects of speech prosody is more associated with left hemispheric language regions and explicit evaluation of emotional prosody is related to bilateral orbitofrontal regions. Our data support this assertion, with evident overlap between the regions preferentially activated by the tone-sequence and those elicited during emotional prosodic tasks. Explicit analysis of linguistic aspects preferentially evoked appraisal by left hemispheric regions, fitting with other work [ , , - ] and this may reflect the processing of this lexical content of the stimuli. 

Our third hypothesis was that 'increased demand' would be associated with enhanced activation in the right frontal and temporal cortices. Subjects reported finding tone-sequence trials harder than sentence ones - fitting with Patel's notion of extra 'redundancy' cues in the lexical trials [ , ] - and that   same   pairs were 'more difficult' than   different   ones. Interestingly, behavioural data conflicts with subjective perception, demonstrating that subjects more accurate in   same   tasks: during these subjects needed to hold the entire   same   trial pair in working memory, and examine these for subtle (non-existent) differences; as opposed to   different   pairs where participants could discard the stimuli once   any   pitch difference was noted. As such,   same   and   tone-sequence   may have been proxy markers for cognitive demand rather than 'difficulty' per se, as well as tone-sequence exploring 'purer' pitch processing. 

During the tone-sequence task there was   relatively   increased right STG and left precuneus activation when paired tone stimuli were the   same  , compared to when different. The interaction analysis (Figures  ; Table  ) looked at the effect of one factor (  stimulus type: sentence or tone sequence  ) on another factor (  trial type: same or different  ). Regions which can differentiate between these factors are all right sided: the STG, Inferior Frontal Gyrus and Middle Frontal Gyrus. Each of these discriminatory regions show increased activation in tone-sequence, as opposed to sentence, tasks, and during   same   compared to   different   stimuli (Figure  ). 
  
 Graphed differential activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus in the interaction analysis of Figure 3 demonstrating activation in the two task types (sentence/tone-sequence) and two trial types (same/different)  . SSQ, a ""sum of squares ratio"" is a statistical indicator of activity, as described in the methods section. 
  
The authors' interpretation of our data is that it best fits with the task dependent hypothesis that the left hemisphere is hemispherically specialized for lexical and short syntactic aspects of pitch whilst the right hemisphere is superior at processing suprasegmental pitch. Subjects' reports place tone sequence and   same   trials as being more difficult and the interaction analysis of activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (Figure  ) shows increasing activation for these: in both instances subjects are processing a larger, full trial, sequence at a suprasegmental level. 

In conclusion, our data support the premise that prosodic pitch perception is subserved by the bifrontal and temporal cortices, specifically the Superior Temporal Gyrus, Inferior Frontal Gyrus and Middle Frontal Gyrus, with the degree of hemispheric involvement dependent upon the task. These areas were activated when both tone-sequence and sentence paradigms were used, thus confounding lexical stimuli were removed, though the former preferentially activated the right hemispheric regions, the latter the left. There was a relative increase in activation in the right frontal and temporal cortices during 'same' stimuli tasks, which was deemed to be more demanding, as subjectively reported by subjects, in terms of prosodic comprehension and this, in our opinion, is due to the need to analyse pitch at a broader 'sentence level'. Our data is in agreement with the assertion [ ] of hemispheric specialisation fitting with the task dependent hypothesis, which would have predicted the lateralization [ ] found in this study. 

Language prosody processing is complex and consists of multiple components. Current understanding of it involves several competing theories, neither of which has garnered consistent support. The vast majority of the literature focuses on emotional prosody: further work is needed to provide a more coherent and distinctive conceptualization of linguistic prosodic processing.

# Title

Close to You: Embodied Simulation for Peripersonal Space in Primary Somatosensory Cortex

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated that in contrast to the classic understanding the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) reflects merely seen touch (in the absence of any real touch on the own body). Based on these results it has been discussed that SI may play a role in understanding touch seen on other bodies. In order to further examine this understanding of observed touch, the current study aimed to test if mirror-like responses in SI are affected by the perspective of the seen touch. Thus, we presented touch on a hand and close to the hand either in first-person-perspective or in third-person-perspective. 


## Principal Findings 
  
Results of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed stronger vicarious brain responses in SI/BA2 for touch seen in first-person-perspective. Surprisingly, the third-person viewpoint revealed activation in SI both when subjects viewed a hand being stimulated as well as when the space close to the hand was being touched. 


## Conclusions/Significance 
  
Based on these results we conclude that vicarious somatosensory responses in SI/BA2 are affected by the viewpoint of the seen hand. Furthermore, we argue that mirror-like responses in SI do not only reflect seen touch, but also the peripersonal space surrounding this body (in third-person-perspective). We discuss these findings with recent studies on mirror responses for action observation in peripersonal space. 

 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
In social situations, recognition and understanding of actions of the conspecific are extremely important for appropriate behaviour. According to Prinz   this understanding is accomplished by an internal simulation of the actions we are observing. The neurobiological foundation of this process may be so-called mirror neurons, which discharge when a particular action is performed and also when one observes the same action performed by others  . However, in order to assess social situations the recognition and understanding of touch events is also essential. Touch is the first sense to develop and from infancy it is important to acquire information and to manipulate the environment  . Recent studies have demonstrated that viewing touch involves the observers' somatosensory cortices, which has been explained by an internal simulation process similar to action observation  ,  . For example, Keysers et al.   showed that observing someone else's legs being touched with a stick resulted in neural activity in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). Furthermore, an fMRI study by Blakemore et al.   revealed that observation of touch to a face or a neck was associated with activity in SI, SII, superior temporal sulcus (STS), and premotor cortex. The premotor cortex and the STS are also parts of the mirror system for action observation  . In monkeys, the premotor cortex has been shown to contain neurons that respond both to the execution and the observation of action  . Based on these results the authors suggest an analogous mirror system for observation of touch  . Similar results for SI, SII, and premotor cortex have been reported by Ebisch et al.  ,  . An increasing body of evidence supports these findings  – . Thus, SI and SII may not only be involved in the actual perception of experienced touch but might also provide a somatic dimension to our perception of other people's experiences  ,  ,  . However, the way the somatosensory cortices may contribute to this kind of social perception still remains to be cleared. 

The current study tries to further examine the role of somatosensory brain regions for social perception. A first aim of the present study was to test if mirror-like responses in SI and other brain regions are affected by different viewpoints of the observed touch. Our previous study   has demonstrated that SI reflects differences regarding first- (1PP) and second-person-perspective (2PP) when observing touch  . Viewing touch in 2PP showed a hand with fingers pointing to the observer, while touch seen in 1PP depicted the hand with fingers pointing away from the observing participant. Observing touch from both viewpoints elicited vicarious somatosensory activation. Furthermore, touch seen in 2PP was associated with stronger activation in SI/BA2. While our previous study   presented video clips with a hand always either in 1PP or 2PP, we here argue that there is also another perspective, which we did not examine in the former work. Thus, the present study aimed to further test the factor perspective by showing a hand in 3PP. What is the 3PP? In 3PP the participant is no longer directly involved in the interaction. To a far more extent (compared with 2PP and 1PP) the participant here is an out-sided observer, who is looking on a touched hand that is not anymore potentially related to his or her bodily self. Viewing a hand in 2PP as in our previous paper (with finger pointing to the observer) may include a stimulation character to the observer. For example, we often see a hand with fingers pointing to us when somebody wants to receive something. In other situations a hand in 2PP may fulfil the function to point to the observer (with the whole hand). Furthermore, we often see a hand with fingers pointing to us when somebody wants to say hello to us, inviting us to shake hands with him. In all these examples a hand in 2PP has a demanding character to the observer. In contrast, when seeing a hand in 3PP the observer is more independent. Therefore, a hand in 2PP marks a different social situation compared with seeing a hand in 3PP, in which the observer is looking on a touched hand that is not anymore potentially related to his or her bodily self. Thus, viewing touch in 3PP is different from observations in 1PP- or 2PP. We hypothesized that vicarious activity in SI may reflect the difference between observation of touch in 1PP and 3PP, thus providing further support for higher cognitive processing in somatosensory cortices. 

A second aim of the present study was to test if events occurring close to the body are similarly “mirrored"". Thus, we wanted to test if the observations of events in the peripersonal space similarly result in vicarious activation of (somatosensory) brain regions. Peripersonal space refers to the space surrounding our bodies within the reach of our limbs. In contrast, extrapersonal space refers to space beyond the reach of our limbs  . According Graziano et al.   a neural circuit including at least premotor area 6, the putamen, and parts of parietal cortices (ventral intraparietal area (VIP), medial intraparietal area (MIP), and area 7b of the parietal lobe) is dedicated to code peripersonal space  – . A recent study   revealed that mirror neurons in the monkey's premotor cortex differentially encode peri- and extrapersonal space when observing actions. Based on these results we hypothesized a similar involvement of vicarious somatosensory brain areas when viewing movements close to a body. Since mirror-like responses during the observation of touch have been related to the understanding of touch and to social perception  , we argue that events seen in the peripersonal space close to a body might also be important to recognize and understand social situations. 

In order to test our hypotheses we employed an fMRI paradigm to present video clips depicting a hand that received non-painful touch with a paintbrush or video clips showing the paintbrush touching the space close to the hand. The experimental design was based on the paradigms of Keysers et al.   and Schaefer et al.  . In 1PP the hand was shown in a position congruent to the participant's body (similar to our previous study  ). The 3PP presented the same stimulation but here the hand was shown in an anatomical impossible way relative to the participant's body and pointed towards a second hand (see  ). The second hand was added in order to support a 3PP viewpoint situation. We hypothesized a different involvement of SI depending on the viewpoint of observation.

## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Twelve subjects (six females) with a mean age of 26 years (range 23–39 years) participated in the first experiment, 14 in the second (seven females, mean age 23 years, range 24–30 years). The participants gave informed written consent to the study, which adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the human subjects committee of the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. 

All subjects were right-handed as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory  . 


### Procedure for the first study 
  
The design of the first experiment consisted out of two factors. The first factor was viewing perspective (1PP vs. 3PP). The second factor was space (touch observation in personal space ( = PS) vs. in peripersonal space ( = PPS)). Furthermore, there was an additional block with actual touch ( = real touch). 

For 1PP, subjects watched video clips in which a right hand was presented in an anatomically congruent position (finger pointing away from participants body). For 3PP the depicted (stimulated) right hand was pointing to the right and faced a second (left) hand. Both of those hands were positioned orthogonal to the subject's own hand. Furthermore, the hands were depicted in an anatomical impossible way relative to the participant's body (see  ). For the factor space, half of the video clips showed a hand being touched on the index finger repeatedly by a paintbrush (i.e., the PS condition) and the other half the paintbrush did not touch the hand but the space close to the hand (i.e., the PPS condition). The same visual stimuli and motion frequency (1 per second) were applied in all video clips across viewing perspective and observed action. In PPS condition the paintbrush made identical motions as in the touch hand condition except that in the former, the brush stroked on the side of the index finger (distance about 1–2 cm). In all conditions, a right hand was stimulated. The motion of the paintbrush was vertical in about 90 percent of all trials and horizontal in about 10 percent. Subjects were required to press a key to report the number of vertical strokes at the end of each video clip. This was to ensure that subjects were attentively observing the video presentation (similar to  ,  ). 

In addition to the above-mentioned four conditions, each subject also received a stimulation block in which the hands were repeatedly touched by a paintbrush during the fMRI scan. This run was applied after the touch observation conditions at the end of the experiment. In this block the left and the right hand were (alternating) touched by a paintbrush. The manner and frequency of the brushing were identical to that shown in the videos. Instead of video clips the participants here viewed a fixation cross. The touch of the hand was not viewable. We applied this block in order to localize the somatosensory cortices in each individual. 

The experiment consisted out of three runs. Each run included all conditions. Conditions were presented in a randomized order. Video clips lasted for 18 sec and were followed by a resting period of 15 sec (+−3 sec), in which a fixation cross was shown (baseline condition). The experiment lasted for about 45 min. 


### Procedure for the second study 
  
The second experiment was identical to the first experiment, except that we added three further conditions and removed the conditions of 1PP. In a first condition subjects viewed movies with a paintbrush moving (similar to the PS and PPS conditions), but without depicting any body parts (movement only condition). In a second condition the participants observed the hands of the 3PP condition, but without any movements or touch towards those hands (hands only condition). Thus, they viewed hands simply resting on a table. The task for the movement only condition was identical to the first experiment. For the hands only condition we asked subjects to judge if one of the presented hands was a female hand and to press a key after the video has ended. 

Furthermore, we aimed to test if only observation of movements or events close to the body (peripersonal space) elicit vicarious somatosensory responses or if events far away from the body (extrapersonal space) also result in mirror-like responses in somatosensory cortices. Thus, we applied a third condition that showed paintbrush movements far from the actor's hand (about 20 cm), testing for vicarious somatosensory responses for events occurring in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Taken together, the second experiment included the conditions PS, PPS, EPS, movement only, and hands only (always in 3PP). The order of the conditions was randomized. Presentation procedure was analogue to the first experiment. 


### FMRI data acquisition and analysis: First study 
  
The functional imaging for the first study was conducted by using a 1.5 T scanner (General Electrics Signa LX, USA) to conduct functional imaging (gradient echo T2-weighted echo-planar images; TR = 2 sec, TE = 35 ms, flip angle = 80 degrees, FOV = 20 mm). For each subject, data were acquired in three scan runs. In each session, 392 volumes were acquired including 4 ‘dummy’ volumes, which were acquired at the start of each session and subsequently discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects. Functional volumes consisted of 23 slices. Each volume comprised 5 mm slices (1 mm gap, in plane voxel size 3.125×3.125 mm). For anatomical reference a high-resolution T1-weighted structural image was collected (3D-SPGR, TR = 24 ms, TE = 8 ms). 

Visual images were back-projected to a screen at the end of the scanner bed close to the subject's feet. Subjects viewed the images through a mirror mounted on the birdcage of the receiving coil. Foam cushions were placed tightly around the side of the subject's head to minimize head motion. 

The fMRI data was analyzed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping Software (SPM5, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, London, UK). The images were realigned to correct for head movements using sinc interpolation and subsequently normalized into a standard anatomical space (MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute template) resulting in isotropic 3 mm voxels. Data were then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full-width half maximum. 

Statistical parametric maps were calculated using multiple regressions with the hemodynamic response function modeled in SPM5. Data analyses were performed at two levels. We examined data on the individual subject level by using a fixed effects model (all three runs concatenated for each subject). Then, the resulting parameter estimates for each regressor at each voxel were entered into a second-level analysis with the random effects model. We calculated an ANOVA for repeated measurements with the factors perspective (1PP vs. 3PP) and space (PS vs. PPS). Subsequently, statistical contrasts (t tests) were performed to examine cortical activation associated with PS vs. PPS conditions in 1PP and 3PP. Furthermore, we calculated contrasts between 1PP and 3PP for PS and PPS conditions. To examine common activations during real tactile stimulation and observation of touch events, the contrasts were inclusively masked by the contrast (p<0.05) of real touch relative to baseline. The resulting images were thresholded at p<0.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons over the whole brain. Anatomical interpretation of the functional imaging results was performed by using the SPM anatomy toolbox  . 


### FMRI data acquisition and analysis: Second study 
  
Data acquisition for the second study was done on a 3 T scanner (Siemens MAGNETOM Trio, Germany) (gradient echo T2-weighted echo-planar images; TR = 2 sec, TE = 35 ms, flip angle = 80 degrees, FOV = 224 mm). For each subject, data were acquired in four runs. In each session, 392 volumes were acquired. Functional volumes consisted of 32 slices. Each volume comprised 3.5 mm slices (no gap, in plane voxel size 3.5×3.5 mm). For anatomical reference a high-resolution T1-weighted structural image was collected (MPRAGE, TR = 1650 ms, TE = 5 ms). Subjects viewed the images through a mirror mounted on the birdcage of the receiving coil. Foam cushions were placed tightly around the side of the subject's head to minimize head motion. 

Data preprocessing was analogue to the first study. Statistical parametric maps were calculated using multiple regressions with the hemodynamic response function modeled in SPM5. Similar to the first study, data analyses were performed at two levels. First, we examined data on the individual subject level by using a fixed effects model (all three runs concatenated for each subject). Second, the resulting parameter estimates for each regressor at each voxel were then entered into a second-level analysis with the random effects model. We calculated an ANOVA for repeated measurements with the factor condition (PS; PPS; EPS, hands only, movement only). Subsequently, statistical contrasts (t tests) were performed to examine cortical activation associated with PS relative to PPS, PS relative to EPS, and PPS relative to EPS. Furthermore, we compared the condition PPS relative to hands only and movement only conditions. The post-hoc tests were reported masked and not masked with real touch condition. 

The resulting images were thresholded at p<0.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons over the whole brain. In addition, we report regions of interest that survived a small volume correction (SVC) of p<0.05 (FWE corrected) for which we had an a priori hypothesis  ,  . Thus, a SVC was applied to activations within a sphere of 5 mm radius in the postcentral gyrus (SI) and 5 mm radius in the parietal operculum (SII). Anatomical interpretation of the functional imaging results was performed by using the SPM anatomy toolbox  . 



## Results 
  
### First study 
  
#### Results for real touch stimulation 
  
FMRI data revealed that the real touch stimulation of the participant's' right (respectively, left) hand (real touch vs. baseline) activated a number of somatosensory regions including contralateral SI, bilateral parietal operculum (SII/parietal ventral area), the precentral gyrus (BA4/BA6), the insula, the lateral temporo-occipatal cortex, the superior parietal/intraparietal cortex, and the thalamus (p<0.05, FWE corrected). 


#### Main effect for space 
  
Results of an ANOVA including the two within subjects factors perspective (1PP, 3PP) and space (PS, PPS) revealed a significant main effect for space, including left SI, bilateral insula, bilateral precentral gyrus (BA6), L SII, and cerebellum (at p<0.05, FWE corrected; masked with real touch). 


#### Main effect for perspective 
  
Furthermore, the ANOVA revealed a significant main effect for perspective, involving bilateral premotor cortex (BA6), bilateral insula, left temporal pole, and cerebellum (at p<0.05, FWE corrected; masked with real touch). 


#### Interaction effect of space and perspective 
  
The ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between the factors space and perspective. The effect included bilateral SI, bilateral insula, bilateral SII, right inferior parietal lobe, bilateral premotor cortex (BA6), bilateral precentral gyrus, and cerebellum (at p<0.05, FWE corrected; masked with real touch). 


#### Main effect for space (unmasked) 
  
Furthermore, we calculated an analogue ANOVA without somatosensory mask. The resulting main effect for space revealed additional activation in medial prefrontal cortex (at p<0.05, FWE corrected). 


#### Main effect for perspective (unmasked) 
  
The main effect for perspective not restricted to somatosensory brain regions revealed no additional areas (at p<0.05, FWE corrected). 


#### Interaction effect space and perspective (unmasked) 
  
The interaction for space and perspective revealed no additional areas (at p<0.05, FWE corrected). 


#### Post-hoc t-test: Results for space in 1PP (PS>PPS) 
  
In order to further examine the significant interaction between space and perspective, we used post-hoc t-tests. These analyses were limited to voxels showing the correct significant effect. 

Significant overlap for real touch and observed touch in 1PP (PS>PPS, masked with real touch condition>baseline) was found in the left postcentral gyrus (SI/BA2), SII, and anterior insula (at p<0.05, FWE corrected, see   and  ). The contrast PPS relative to PS failed to show any significant activation. When not being masked (whole brain) results for observation of touch did not reveal any additional activations (at p<0.05, FWE corrected).

The overlap for tactile stimulation and observed touch in 3PP (PS>PPS, masked with real touch>baseline) revealed no significant activations (at p<0.05, FWE corrected). When not being masked, the results still failed to show any significant voxels. In contrast, observation of movements in peripersonal space (PPS) relative to PS events showed significant effects in bilateral SI, left SII, and mid insula (masked with real touch>baseline; p<0.05, FWE corrected; see   and  ). When not being masked results for observation of movements in peripersonal space relative to touch hand observation (whole brain) revealed additional brain activation in premotor cortex (MNI coordinates: 28, −12, 64, z = 5.86, 33 voxels, p<0.05, FWE corrected).

For 3PP both of the contrasts (PS and PPS relative to baseline) revealed strong bilateral somatosensory responses in SI. In contrast, for 1PP brain responses to PPS relative to baseline yielded only minor activations in left SI.   shows the results of these comparisons expressed as percentage signal change of BOLD responses in left SI.

All results were at p<0.05, FWE corrected, and masked with real touch relative to baseline in order to reveal common activations with somatosensory areas.

Further analysis of the fMRI data contrasted observation of a touched hand in 1PP with 3PP (masked with real touch>baseline; p<0.05, FWE corrected). Results revealed significant activation in left SI (BA2), premotor cortex and SMA (BA 6), SII, and mid insula (see   and  ). Unmasked data revealed no further significant activation (at p<0.05, FEW corrected). The analogue contrast between 3PP and 1PP did not reveal any significant activation (masked or unmasked, at p<0.05, FWE corrected).

#### Post-hoc t-test: Results for perspective for PPS (1PP>3PP) 
  
We further tested for active brain regions when comparing the different perspectives for the PPS condition. The contrast PPS in 1PP relative to PPS in 3PP failed to show any significant activation (masked or unmasked with real touch, at p<0.05, FWE corrected). The contrast PPS in 3PP relative to PPS in 1PP revealed a broad network of significant brain activations including postcentral gyri, premotor areas, left SII, and left mid insula (masked with real touch, at p<0.05, FWE corrected). The unmasked contrast showed no further brain activations (at p<0.05, FWE corrected). 



### Second study 
  
#### Main effect of condition 
  
To examine why observation of PPS events in 3PP were associated with somatosensory activation we conducted the second experiment. Here we applied additional conditions, in which the participants viewed the hand and a moving paintbrush far from the viewed hand (EPS), a moving paintbrush alone or hands simply resting on a table (in 3PP) without any stimulation or movements. 

An ANOVA including the factor condition (PS, PPS, EPS, hands only, movement only) revealed a significant main effect, demonstrating activation in left SI, bilateral premotor cortex, left SII, left mid insula and bilateral inferior parietal cortex (masked with real touch>baseline; p<0.05, FWE corrected). The unmasked results revealed additional activation in premotor areas and occipital brain regions (at p<0.05, FWE corrected). 


#### Post-hoc t-test PS>PPS 
  
Subsequent post-hoc t-tests included only voxels showing activation in the main effect of the ANOVA. The contrast PS relative to PPS demonstrated activation of left SI and SII (masked with real touch, at p<0.05, FWE corrected). Unmasked results involved additional activation in occipital areas (at p<0.05, FWE corrected). The opposite contrast PPS relative to PS revealed no significant brain areas (masked or unmasked, at p<0.05, FWE corrected). 

Contrast of parameter estimates for activations in SI (relative to baseline) revealed activations both for PS and PPS (see  ). Thus, presenting video clips showing a touched hand (PS) as well as video clips depicting movements in the space close to the hand (PPS) resulted in activation of SI. Hence, the results replicated the outcome of the first study with regard to an engagement of SI both for PS and PPS.

The conditions EPS, hands only and movement only failed to show significant activation of somatosensory brain areas (at p<0.05, FWE corrected, masked with real touch>baseline in order to reveal common activations with real touch). C: Contrast of parameter estimates for activations in left SI (based on ANOVA main effect, see text) demonstrates activation both for PS and PPS conditions, thus replicating the results of the first study. D: Statistical maps for the contrast PS>EPS and PPS>EPS revealed brain activation in left SI (FWE corrected, masked with real touch>baseline). E: Statistical maps for the contrast PPS>hands only show brain activation in left SI and left premotor cortex (FWE corrected, unmasked results). 
  

#### Post-hoc t-tests PS>EPS 
  
We further compared brain responses for PS relative to EPS. Results revealed activation of left SI and SII. No other brain area showed significant activation (masked with real touch, at p<0.05, FWE corrected). Unmasked results demonstrated additional activation in occipital brain regions. The opposite contrast (EPS relative to PS) revealed activation only in occipital brain regions (unmasked, at p<0.05, FWE corrected). Furthermore, the contrast EPS relative to baseline revealed no significant activation in somatosensory brain regions (masked with real touch, at p>0.05, FWE corrected). 


#### Post-hoc t-test PPS>EPS 
  
The comparison between PPS and EPS revealed significant activations in left SI and left SII (masked with real touch, at p<0.05, FWE corrected). Unmasked results showed no additional activations. The contrast EPS relative to PPS failed to show significant voxels (unmasked or masked, at p<0.05, FWE corrected). 


#### Post-hoc t-tests PPS relative to movement only and hands only 
  
Comparisons between PPS relative to movement only engaged left SI and SII (masked with real touch, p<0.05, FWE corrected). Unmasked results showed additional activation in left premotor cortex and occipital cortex (at p<0.05, FWE corrected). Comparison to hands only showed similar results. The contrasts movement only and hands only relative to PPS failed to show any significant activation (masked or unmasked, at p<0.05 FWE corrected). 


#### Post-hoc t-tests movement only>rest and hands only>rest 
  
The contrast movement only relative to rest revealed activation in right inferior parietal cortex (masked with real touch, at p<0.05, FWE corrected). Unmasked results showed additional activation in occipital brain areas (at p<0.05, FWE corrected). 

The comparison hands only relative to rest failed to show significant activations (masked with real touch, at p<0.05, FWE corrected). Unmasked results showed significant activation in occipital areas (at p<0.05, FWE corrected). Thus, neither the hands nor the moving paintbrush alone elicited activation in SI or SII. 


#### Effects of task performance on brain response in SI 
  
In order to examine possible interactions of the BOLD response in SI with task accuracy we computed correlations between the BOLD responses in SI (for both experiments) with accuracy of task performance. Results failed to show significant correlations (all p>0.10). 




## Discussion 
  
The current study examined the role of somatosensory brain regions when observing touch to a hand (PS) and movements close to the hand (PPS), either in 1PP or in 3PP. When viewing a hand being touched in 1PP the observer's left sensory cortex (SI, SII/insula) showed activation relative to baseline and relative to observation of touch close to the hand, thus confirming previous studies (e.g.,  ). In contrast, when seeing a hand being touched in 3PP, observation of both, touch to a hand and touch close to the hand, revealed activation of bilateral SI (relative to baseline) and SII/insula. Thus, even viewing touch close to the hand yielded vicarious somatosensory activation. Furthermore, activity in SI/BA2, SII and insula for the touch hand condition was stronger in 1PP compared with 3PP (relative to baseline). 

The results for 1PP are in line with recent studies demonstrating activity in SI and SII merely by viewing touch in the absence of any direct stimulation (e.g.,  – ). Analysis of parameter estimates demonstrated that observing touch to a hand relative to baseline was associated with an increase in SI, while viewing touch close to the hand showed only minor activation in SI, as expected (analogue to   and  ). If we compare the engagement of SI for touch hand observations in 1PP with 3PP, the results show that seeing touch in 1PP elicited stronger activation in SI/BA2 than in 3PP (relative to baseline). Thus, the results provide support for our hypothesis that the viewpoint (or the cognitive distance) of observed touch matters, thereby drawing the attention to higher cognitive processing in somatosensory cortices. 

Surprisingly, observing touch in 3PP engaged the sensory cortices in a different pattern. Here the contrast PS relative to PPS revealed no significant voxels, but movements in peripersonal space relative to touch hand demonstrated an involvement of bilateral SI, SII and insula. Further analyses demonstrated that relative to baseline both conditions (touch hand and movements in peripersonal space) elicited activation in SI. These findings were replicated by the second experiment. Why were both events (touch hand and movements in peripersonal space) in 3PP associated with SI activity? Observation of touch close to the hand is different from a resting condition. There may be three reasons why SI was activated by movements in peripersonal space. First, the stroking of the paintbrush might have activated the putative mirror neuron system for observed actions, which is known to involve SI (e.g.,  – ). Although only the moving paintbrush (without the holding hand) was viewable, a recent study revealed that even the movements of robotic arms may activate the mirror system  . Second, the mere depiction of a hand might have elicited somatosensory activation. It has been demonstrated that seeing a non-stimulated body part may alter somatosensory processing in SI (e.g.,  ). Third, a combination of both factors may explain the results. In order to disentangle the roles of motion and body part depiction we conducted the second experiment. The results demonstrated that neither the moving paintbrush nor the depiction of the hands alone elicited neural responses in the somatosensory cortices (even at an uncorrected level of p<0.001). Since we did not find any effects of task performance, it seems unlikely that attention or task effects may explain this lack of activation. We conclude that only a combination of both, moving paintbrush and picture of a hand, seems to be sufficient to evoke somatosensory activation in the observer. Touching the space close to a hand may have been perceived as “touch"" of the peripersonal space. Several studies have demonstrated that not only touching the body but also invading the space close to the body affects sensorimotor processing (e.g.,  ). In animals, this peripersonal space seems to be related to defensive behavior and important for the construction of a margin of safety around the body  . In the present study the observation of a “touched"" peripersonal space seemed to be simulated in the observer's somatosensory cortex. This interpretation is supported by the lack of vicarious somatosensory responses when seeing the moving paintbrush far from the hand (EPS condition). Thus, only events in peripersonal space, not in extrapersonal space, were associated with mirror-like responses in somatosensory brain regions. 

The results were supported by a recent study about the visual perspective on cortical body representation  . The authors reported a suppression of activation in SI for viewing body parts from an allocentric perspective, but no change for the egocentric perspective. Our results similarly revealed differential responses in SI depending on the viewpoint, although we did not find a suppression of activation in SI. 

Furthermore, our results are supported by a recent animal study. Caggiano et al.   showed that mirror neurons in the monkey's premotor cortex differentially encode peri- and extrapersonal space. The results of the present study extend these findings in two important ways. First, our results demonstrate that mirror-like responses   in SI   (and SII/insula) reflect the peripersonal space of a seen body part. Second, our study shows that vicarious somatosensory responses are especially sensitive to touch seen in the peripersonal space of an   alien body  . In other words, mirror-like responses in SI do not only seem to reflect the peripersonal space of the own body (as shown by Caggiano et al.   for mirror neurons in the premotor cortex), but also that of an alien body (seen in 3PP). This points to an enhanced complex processing of mirror-like responses in somatosensory brain areas, perceiving not only the perspective of observed touch but also the peripersonal space of an alien body. 

In addition, observation of movements close to the hand (PPS) revealed an involvement of the premotor cortex. This activation was not vicarious, because it was only seen when not masking the results with the results of the real touch condition. Nevertheless, in the context of our study this is important because of three reasons. First, the premotor cortex has been reported to be a key structure for mirror responses in action observation (e.g.,  ). Second, in paradigms on touch observation an involvement of the premotor cortex has also been demonstrated  ,  ,  . Thus, our results may point to a role for the mirror system when observing events in the peripersonal space. Third, the premotor cortex has been shown to be an important brain region for the representation of the peripersonal space  – . Since the premotor cortex in our study was engaged only when viewing events in the peripersonal space (and not in the personal space condition), the results suggest that in this condition the peripersonal space was vicariously activated. 

It seems remarkable that events in the peripersonal space were “mirrored"" in SI when they were shown in 3PP, but only to a small extent when they were seen in 1PP. Thus, if touch in the peripersonal space is perceived to happen to somebody else, the somatosensory cortices seem to be more affected than when it seems to happen in the peripersonal space around our own body. One explanation for this effect of perspective may be that events we are used to see very often (touch of the space close to our hands) have only limited salience to the somatosensory mirror system. In contrast, when the same events happen in the peripersonal space of somebody else, this may be potentially more important to understand the situation. In an animal study Graziano et al.   reported that tactile neurons in the precentral gyrus do not respond to the touch of the familiar primate chair, to which the monkey was habituated. Graziano et al.   called this the clothing effect. Thus, events that are very close to our body and we are highly used to may not be represented by a putative mirror system. In contrast, Caggiano et al.   examined the peripersonal space of monkeys by either placing the stimuli in the reach of the monkey's hand (peripersonal space) or by locating them out of reach (extrapersonal space). In our study (as well as in  ) the events happened much closer to the body. Thus, the difference of the perspective for the movements in peripersonal space events revealed in our study may be caused by a possible clothing effect in 1PP. 

However, other explanations should also be taken into account. In a recent study Ebisch et al.   demonstrated SI activation associated with the perceived intentionality of the observed touch. The correlation with intentionality was even valid when the touch was caused by a moving branch (instead of a hand). Based on these results the authors suggested a human tendency to resonate with an (assumed) intentional touching agent, here reflected by vicarious somatosensory responses in SI. A similar explanation might also apply for the engagement of SI for seen touch and seen events in the peripersonal space in our study. Although the actor of the paintbrush was not visible, vicarious SI activation may be related to the intentional agent of the moving paintbrush. A recent study demonstrated that even the observation of movements of a robotic arm activated the mirror network  . Thus, the crucial factor for mirror-like responses in SI may not be touch, but the observation (or assumption) of an intentional agent (in contrast to SII). However, in our study not only SI but also SII revealed strong vicarious activation for seen events in peripersonal space. Hence, our data do not support a functional dissociation between SI and SII for events in the peripersonal space (or for seen touch in the personal space). In addition, Ebisch et al. found a correlation with intentionality only for the left SI, while we found bilateral involvement of SI. Future studies seem to be necessary to further disentangle the role of intentionality for vicarious responses in SI. 

Another explanation for somatosensory engagement when seeing events in the peripersonal space of the subject may be that SI activation has been shown to be linked with the simulation or anticipation of sensory experiences. Carlsson et al.   have demonstrated that the expectancy of sensory experiences elicited activity in SI, without actually being touched. Thus, intentional movements inside the peripersonal space as in our study may be followed by sensory activations. This might also explain the activation of premotor brain regions in our study when seeing movement events in extrapersonal space. However, this explanation seems unlikely. If the expectancy of sensory experiences had caused the somatosensory responses in PPS, both 3PP and 1PP would have been affected. 

The results of the present study suggest a role for perspective when viewing body parts receiving touch. Our previous study similarly pointed to a role for perspective when seeing touch  . However, the previous study found different involvement of SI when viewing touch events in 1PP- and 2PP (demonstrating a role for BA2 in particular for 2PP), whereas the current results point to a different involvement of SI for 1PP and 3PP for movements in peripersonal space. Thus, the role of the perspective might be more complex than previously thought. Future studies are needed to further support our hypothesis that the different involvement of vicarious somatosensory responses is based on different social situations marked by the viewpoint of the observer. 

Two further studies addressed the issue of a varying viewpoint. Keysers et al.   manipulated the difficulty of integration of the observed touch into the body schema of the observer and varied the perspective of the seen touch (1PP vs. 2PP). Results revealed activation in SII irrespective of the perspective of the touched body part. However, this was tested only for SII with a region of interest approach. Another recent study similarly varied the viewpoint of seen touch. Bolognini et al.   presented touch and no-touch stimuli in ego- an allocentric perspectives to patients and healthy subjects in a neuropsychological paradigm. The authors found that viewing touch differently affected visual perception depending on which sensory modality is damaged. This result was independent of the perspective of the seen touch. However, the authors did not use functional imaging, making a comparison to our results difficult. Furthermore, Bolognini et al.   presented fingers touching other fingers of the hand as touch stimuli, whereas the current (and also  ) used a paintbrush to show touch stimuli. This difference may also account for the lack of effect of perspective on vicarious somatosensory responses in the Bolognini et al. study. 

Taken together, the results demonstrate that vicarious somatosensory responses are affected by perspective as well as by events in the peripersonal space of the perceived body part. The results support the view that mirror-like responses in somatosensory cortices may provide important contributions to the perception and understanding of other people's sensations and experiences.

# Abstract
 
How is the brain engaged when people are thinking about their hopes, dreams, and obligations? Regulatory focus theory postulates two classes of personal goals and motivational systems for pursuing them. Ideal goals, such as hopes and aspirations, are pursued via the   promotion   system through “making good things happen.” Ought goals, such as obligations or responsibilities, are pursued via the   prevention   system through “keeping bad things from happening.” This study investigated the neural correlates of ideal and ought goal priming using an event-related fMRI design with rapid masked stimulus presentations. We exposed participants to their self-identified ideal and ought goals, yoked-control words and non-words. We also examined correlations between goal-related activation and measures of regulatory focus, behavioral activation/inhibition, and negative affect. Ideal priming led to activation in frontal and occipital regions as well as caudate and thalamus, whereas prevention goal priming was associated with activation in precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. Individual differences in dysphoric/anxious affect and regulatory focus, but not differences in BAS/BIS strength, were predictive of differential activation in response to goal priming. The regions activated in response to ideal and ought goal priming broadly map onto the cortical midline network that has been shown to index processing of self-referential stimuli. Individual differences in regulatory focus and negative affect impact this network and appeared to influence the strength and accessibility of the promotion and prevention systems. The results support a fundamental distinction between promotion and prevention and extend our understanding of how personal goals influence behavior.

## Introduction 
  
A person's hopes, dreams, and wishes, whether attained or unattained, have always been seen as central to an individual's identity—as the essence of who a person is because they represent that which a person strives to be (James,  ). The kind of individual we wish to be, and the kind of person we believe we must be, are powerful influences on behavior and affect whether we see ourselves as succeeding or failing to attain those wishes and obligations (Kelly,  ). Classic (Allport,  ) as well as contemporary (Morf and Mischel,  ) personality theorists, for example, have used the concept of   becoming   as a rubric for understanding individual differences in motivational orientation along with the affective consequences of failing to be that which we want to be or must be. Personal goals are real in a profoundly psychological sense—dreams and obligations are “truth” for individuals whether or not they “come true.” 

The   goal   construct in psychology captures much of how hopes, dreams, and wishes guide behavior and experience. Behavioral scientists have conceptualized personality as reflecting differences among people in terms of the higher-order goals they pursue and their characteristic ways of pursuing them (Cantor and Zirkel,  ). Indeed, goals are a central construct in theories of behavior because they provide a unified conceptual framework linking internal states (needs, motives, beliefs) and the social world. When people believe they have attained an important goal, they may feel joyful, satisfied, fulfilled, or worthy; when people believe they have failed to attain a goal, they may feel inadequate, hopeless, worthless, guilty, or ashamed (Sullivan,  ; Rogers,  ). Yet, to date there has been little research examining how neural systems are engaged when people think about their personal goals, both when the goals are attained as well as when they are not. 

In an influential review, Austin and Vancouver ( ) defined goals as   internal representations of desired states   and identified approach and avoidance goals as among the most important classes of goals. The vast behavioral science and neuroscience literatures on approach and avoidance attest to the centrality of these dimensions for understanding goal-directed behavior. Those literatures are dominated by the behavioral activation and inhibition systems model, postulating brain/behavior systems that underlie temperament-based approach and avoidance as well as dispositional positive and negative affectivity (Watson et al.,  ). Both the behavioral activation system (BAS) and behavioral inhibition system (BIS) are hypothesized to regulate proximal goal-directed behaviors in response to cues for reward, in the case of BAS, or threat, in the case of BIS (Carver and Scheier,  ). The two systems each represent a locus for the interaction of cognitive and affective processes, and each is associated with neural circuitry identified originally on the basis of animal research and shown to have analogs in the human brain (Gray,  ,  ). 

Many personality and social theorists take a complementary perspective on the regulation of approach and avoidance, emphasizing abstract, higher-order goals that are cross-situational and integrated within the individual's sense of self. Higgins ( ) proposed a theory of   regulatory focus   that postulated two motivational systems for attainment of desired outcomes. Each is activated by contextual cues but also manifests trait-like properties across situations. Individual differences in regulatory focus are stable over time and predict which goals will be more likely to be used to guide behavior, as well as the strategies and means for pursuing them (Strauman,  ). The behavioral and affective consequences of individual differences in regulatory focus are well-established (Higgins,  ). 

RFT draws on prior studies of self-evaluation and discrepancy monitoring and describes two regulatory systems that serve critical but distinct survival needs. The   promotion system  , which develops in response to children's need for nurturance (Bowlby,  ), supports the attainment of positive outcomes by strategic approach, i.e., by “making good things happen.” The promotion system is particularly active in the pursuit of ideals (aspirations, advancement, and accomplishment)—that is, the kind of person an individual can be or might be. The   prevention system  , which develops in response to children's need for security (Bowlby,  ), also supports the attainment of positive outcomes, but instead by strategic avoidance, i.e., by “keeping bad things from happening.” The prevention system is particularly active in pursuit of oughts (fulfillment of responsibilities, duties, and obligations)—that is, the kind of person an individual believes she/he must be or is supposed to be. 

Individuals vary both in the characteristic ways they construe their goals and their chosen strategies to pursue them. As a consequence of variation in life experiences, a person might acquire increased value or personal relevance for one type of goal. For example, a strong value placed on prevention goals will result in goal pursuit strategies that involve keeping bad things from happening—for example, by avoiding pitfalls and negative outcomes in the service of ultimate goal attainment. In addition, the same desired end-state can be represented in different ways by prevention-oriented vs. promotion-oriented individuals. The same goal—such as being honest—could be represented as an ideal or aspiration (a promotion goal) or as an obligation or responsibility (a prevention goal). 

In this article, we examine the neural correlates of priming personal goals using ideals and oughts as exemplars of the two types of goal representations postulated within RFT. We consider three largely unexplored questions about how the brain is engaged in pursuit of ideals and oughts. First, does priming of an individual's ideal vs. ought goals, already shown to result in distinct cognitive, motivational, and affective responses, also lead to discriminable patterns of neural activation? Second, do activation patterns associated with ideal vs. ought goals vary as a function of individual differences relevant to self-regulation? And third, since self-regulatory cognition is inherently connected with affect and with vulnerability to disorders such as depression and anxiety, do activation patterns observed following ideal and/or ought goal priming vary depending on an individual's current level of negative affect? 

Based on existing findings in social cognitive neuroscience, there are several different patterns of neural activation that might characterize responses to priming of promotion and prevention goals (and, in turn, contribute to the construct validity of regulatory focus). One set of regions are those structures known to be activated by reward or threat cues, consistent with the role of BAS and BIS as mechanisms for individual differences in sensitivity to such cues (Amodio et al.,  ). There are conceptual links between the BAS system and the promotion system, since promotion goal pursuit requires responsiveness to opportunities for rewards in the environment and the use of strategic approach behaviors to achieve desired ends. There are similar links between the BIS system and the prevention system, because of the relevance of the strategic avoidance of negative outcomes in prevention goal pursuit. BAS-related regions implicated in response to incentives include the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, with the former a locus for the coding of predictions regarding positive outcomes and the latter important for the processing of the hedonic significance of stimuli (Bjork et al.,  ; McClure et al.,  ; Kringelbach,  ; Clithero et al.,  ). Individual differences in BIS strength have been associated with circuits linking the hippocampus, subiculum, and related structures (sometimes also including the basolateral and centromedial nuclei of the amygdala) (e.g., Reuter et al.,  ). Thus, the neural correlates of promotion vs. prevention could reflect the neuroanatomical distinctions between the substrates of BAS and BIS. 

Another potential set of neural correlates of promotion/prevention goal activation is the group of regions referred to collectively as cortical midline structures (Northoff and Bermpohl,  ; Lou et al.,  ; Qin and Northoff,  ). These structures, which typically include the orbital and adjacent medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex, are regarded as an anatomical unit because of strong reciprocal projections among the individual structures and similar patterns of connectivity with other brain regions. They also are characterized as a network that subserves the representation and processing of self-referential stimuli (Beer and Ochsner,  ). This set of regions may underlie the activation of promotion and prevention goals that are functionally linked to aspects of one's identity, including higher-order goals representing one's ideal self or ought self. 

A third possibility is that the promotion and prevention goal representations overlap with the Self-Memory System postulated by Conway (SMS; Conway and Pleydell-Pierce,  ). The SMS is a conceptual framework linking self and memory that consists of two main components: the working self and the autobiographical memory knowledge base. Drawing in part on studies of self-discrepancy and autobiographical memory (e.g., Strauman,  ), Conway ( ) proposed that frontotemporal networks mediate the connection between anterior regions associated with the working self (e.g., one's currently active goals and beliefs) and the autobiographical knowledge base, accessed through temporal lobe regions, needed to effectively pursue such goals within a dynamic interpersonal context. 

Several studies have examined associations between regulatory focus and brain activity, with the evidence to date suggesting a link between promotion/prevention and midline cortical structures as well as a pattern of prefrontal cortex asymmetry akin to that observed in the BAS/BIS literature (Davidson and Irwin,  ). Amodio et al. ( ) examined the associations between an implicit assessment of individual differences in regulatory focus and an EEG index of resting frontal cortical asymmetry. They observed that chronic promotion focus was associated with greater left frontal activity, whereas chronic prevention focus was associated with greater right frontal activity. Cunningham et al. ( ) found that neural activation when making good/bad judgments differed by individuals' regulatory focus: chronic promotion focus was associated with greater activation in the amygdala, anterior cingulate, and extrastriate cortex following positive stimuli, and chronic prevention focus was associated with activity in the same regions for negative stimuli. Touryan et al. ( ) also used fMRI to study the impact of individual differences in regulatory focus on memory for emotional words. They observed that activity in posterior cingulate cortex, associated with self-referential processing, was greater for correctly remembered stimulus words when they were consistent with an individual's regulatory focus. Packer and Cunningham ( ) investigated how regulatory focus interacted with reflection on personal goals and observed differential activation patterns according to goal domain (promotion vs. prevention) and temporal distance (short-term vs. longer-term). 

Two studies have used idiographically selected promotion and prevention goals as stimuli within fMRI designs. Eddington et al. ( ) used incidental semantic priming via a “depth of processing” judgment task to examine patterns of cortical activation associated with promotion and prevention goals. An area of left PFC was activated during promotion goal priming across all four judgment tasks, and the magnitude of activation in this region was correlated significantly with individual differences in strength of orientation to promotion goals. In contrast, activation at this site did not correlate significantly with orientation to prevention goals or with individual differences in BAS/BIS strength. Eddington et al. ( ) examined the neural correlates of promotion and prevention goal priming in a sample of unmedicated adult patients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as an age- and gender-matched control sample of adults with no psychiatric history, using the same judgment task. They hypothesized that MDD patients would show an attenuated left PFC response to promotion priming compared to the non-depressed controls. There was a significant difference in activation between the depressed and non-depressed groups following promotion goal priming, with controls showing greater left medial orbital PFC activation following promotion priming than the depressed patients. In addition, a region in right PFC was activated following prevention priming among MDD patients with comorbid anxiety. 

The findings to date suggest that promotion and prevention may be associated with distinct patterns of neural activation, but none of the prior studies was designed specifically to address that question. In the present study, we adapted an fMRI paradigm developed by Diaz and McCarthy ( ) for rapid masked presentation of semantic stimuli. Masking provides a method for identifying cognitive processes that are preattentive, routinized, and automatic (Dehaene et al.,  ). The use of rapid masked idiographic goal priming offers several significant advantages. First, promotion and prevention goals can be activated automatically like other highly accessible social constructs (i.e., without intentional selection of a goal upon which to focus one's efforts); therefore, a paradigm that would allow detection of implicit priming effects was highly desirable. Second, the two studies by Eddington and colleagues were restricted in the number of goal priming trials included because individuals typically describe a small number of motivationally significant personal goals, thereby limiting the number of goal words available for use as explicit priming stimuli. The use of rapid masked stimulus presentation allows for a greater number of trials within an event-related design (in part because stimuli can be repeated more frequently). Third, because the participant's task in the Diaz and McCarthy paradigm is simply to make a response whenever she/he sees a non-word stimulus in color (e.g., ampersands in red font), a task that was non-self-referential, there is less potential for overlap or interference between the experimental task and priming-based activation of idiographically selected promotion and prevention goals. 

Using this paradigm, we explored three aspects of the neural correlates of promotion and prevention goal representations. First, we examined whether BOLD activation patterns would differ for idiographic priming of promotion goals vs. prevention goals. Second, we examined whether activation in regions associated with promotion/prevention goal priming would be correlated with ratings of perceived success pursuing goals and/or BAS/BIS strength. Third, we examined whether the activation patterns observed following promotion and/or prevention goal priming would be modulated by the individual's current level of negative affect, specifically dysphoric and anxious symptoms. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Overview 
  
Based on an event-related fMRI paradigm developed by Diaz and McCarthy ( ), participants were exposed to a continuing series of rapidly presented masked visual stimuli including (1) a subset of each participant's ideal and ought goals assessed in a prior session, (2) ideal and ought goals of a different participant (as a yoked-control condition), and (3) non-word letter strings. Participants were told that the task was to respond as quickly as possible whenever they detected a string of letters or symbols presented in a colored font. The detection task was actually a means to keep participants attending to the continuous stimulus presentation. BOLD signal responses to ideal and ought goals were contrasted with responses to control words to test hypotheses about neural correlates of personal goal activation. 


### Participants 
  
Participants were recruited through the introductory psychology research pool at Duke University and were part of a larger sample (  N   = 75) who had completed a study earlier in the semester. The initial study session, described as an investigation of personality, included several self-report measures relevant to the present research. Approximately two months after the personality study, potential subjects were contacted by phone and invited to participate in what was described as an investigation of visual attention. Thirty-three students (16 male) agreed to participate; one withdrew from the study prior to the MRI session for medical reasons, and a second student's imaging data were unusable due to technical problems; thus, data from 31 participants were included in analyses. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 22 and were right-handed as indicated by self-report. Participants reported normal neurological history and had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. All participants gave informed consent in accordance with Duke University Institutional Review Board guidelines and received cash payment as compensation for their time. 


### Procedure 
  
#### Individual difference measures 
  
During the personality study session, participants completed a measure of chronic regulatory focus, a measure of temperament-based approach and avoidance tendencies, and two measures of distress. The   Regulatory Focus Questionnaire   (RFQ; Higgins et al.,  ) is a 22-item Likert-style instrument designed to measure individual differences in orientation toward promotion and prevention goals. The RFQ contains four scales (two each for promotion and prevention): two   history   scales measuring the extent to which the individual's socialization history was characterized by an emphasis on promotion or prevention goals, and two   success   scales measuring the extent to which the individual believes she/he has been successful in attaining promotion or prevention goals. Because the psychometric properties of the history scales have yet to be determined, only the success scales were used in the present study. Sample items include: “I feel like I have made progress toward being successful in my life” (promotion success); and “Not being careful enough has gotten me into trouble at times” (prevention success—reverse-scored). Higgins et al. ( ) reported that the success scales had internal consistency reliability (coefficient alpha) of 0.75 or higher, and a 2-month test-retest reliability (Pearson correlation) of 0.79 or higher. 

The   BIS/BAS Scale   (BIS/BAS; Carver and White,  ) is a well-validated instrument containing four scales to measure individual differences in BAS and BIS sensitivity: BIS subscale (coefficient alpha = 0.74), BAS reward responsiveness subscale (coefficient alpha = 0.73), BAS drive subscale (coefficient alpha = 0.76), and BAS fun-seeking subscale (coefficient alpha = 0.66). We report results for a general BAS principal component score combining all three BAS subscales. 

The   Beck Depression Inventory   (BDI; Beck et al.,  ) is a widely used 21-item measure of depressive and dysphoric symptoms. Respondents are asked to endorse items varying in severity from (0) to (3) in a number of life areas. For example, “I do not feel sad” scored (0); and “I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it” scored (3). The highest rating for each item was summed across all 21 items to create a continuous measure of depressive symptoms. 

The   State Trait Anxiety Inventory   (STAI; Spielberger et al.,  ) is a self-report assessment which includes separate measures of state anxiety and the more general quality of trait anxiety. Participants completed only the trait version for the current investigation. The essential qualities evaluated by the 20-item STAI-T scale are feelings of apprehension, tension, nervousness, and worry (e.g., “I am jittery”). Items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (  not at all  ) to 4 (  very much so  ) and summed to create a scale score. Given the high correlations for the BDI and STAI in this sample (  r   = 0.75), and our anticipation that we would not find distinct patterns of dysphoric vs. anxious affect in this unselected sample of healthy college students (Nitschke et al.,  ), the two scales were combined by summing individual scale z-scores into a single dysphoric/anxious index representing current level of negative affect. 


#### Promotion and prevention goal generation and selection 
  
During the personality study session, participants also completed a computerized version of the   Selves Questionnaire   (SQ; Higgins et al.,  ). The SQ is a semi-structured measure that was used to sample participants' own promotion and prevention goals. Participants listed traits or attributes for two different self-state representations: the attributes of the kind of person they ideally would like to be (ideal self-guides, which function as promotion goals) and the attributes of the kind of person they believe it is their obligation or responsibility to be (ought self-guides, which function as prevention goals). Personal goal stimuli for the priming task were obtained from each participant's responses to the computerized SQ. Following the procedures used by Strauman ( ), four promotion goals (“ideal self” responses) and four prevention goals (“ought self” responses) that were semantically unrelated were identified for each participant from among that participant's total set of SQ responses. All of the goals selected from participants' SQ responses were positively valenced. Then the promotion and prevention goals were pooled across subjects, and for each participant a set of eight yoked-control words was selected from that pool so that each yoked-control word was semantically unrelated to all of the participant's promotion and prevention goals. The yoked-control priming condition was included to rule out the alternative hypothesis that the semantic content of an ideal or ought word, rather than its status as a personal goal, might account for the activation observed following a priming trial. 


#### Goal priming task 
  
The fMRI task was adapted from Diaz and McCarthy ( ). Participants viewed a continuous stream of masked words and non-words while performing a detection task in which they were asked to make a response to a visible colored non-word stimulus (e.g., percent signs in red font). The detection task ensured participant engagement, while the non-word priming controlled for perceptual and orthographic processing. The masked word stimuli were of three types: a subset of the participant's promotion (ideal) goals, a subset of the participant's prevention (ought) goals, and yoked-control words (ideal and ought goals of other participants which had no self-regulatory significance for the participant her/himself). Three runs, each 600 s in length, were conducted. The stimuli for each run consisted of words (ideal goals, ought goals, or a yoked-control word) and non-word letter strings that were masked and displayed in a fixed width font. All goal words (ideal, ought, and yoked-control) were positively valenced trait attributes. The non-words were random consonant strings, each 4–10 characters in length. Each letter string was padded with pound signs so that letters were centered and each stimulus was 12 characters in length, in order to ensure that the same amount of the visual field was occupied on any given priming trial. 

Figure   presents an example sequence of priming trials within the overall experimental design as viewed by each participant. Participants viewed a constantly changing visual display in which a stimulus was presented every 1500 ms for a duration of 33 ms. The majority of the trials were masked non-words; a masked word from one of the three remaining stimulus conditions was presented approximately every 12 s. In each run, 16 ideal priming trials, 16 ought priming trials, and 16 yoked-control priming trials were included. All word and non-word letter strings were preceded and followed by pound sign strings for 155 ms, which served as pattern masks. In turn, the pound sign strings alternated with percent sign strings such that the subject was exposed to a continuously changing visual stream. The masked non-word trials ensured that brain regions responsive to physical features and orthography would be continuously active. Any brain region that was responsive to one of the three word priming conditions therefore reflected a higher level of cognitive processing. Participants were instructed to press a button when they detected a letter or symbol string presented in a color font. Those target events occurred infrequently (mean interval = 25 s) and were not in close temporal proximity to word priming trials. All stimuli were displayed on MRI-compatible LCD goggles.

The sequence for an individual trial consisted of alternating pound signs and percent signs, in between which a word or non-word was inserted. Promotion goal, prevention goal, and yoked-control priming stimuli were inserted throughout the run. Incidental to those stimuli visible colored symbol stimuli were displayed to which participants were instructed to respond with a button press as quickly as possible. 
  

#### Manipulation check 
  
The participants were not informed that words or non-words would be presented. In order to evaluate subjects' perceptions of the masked stimuli, both subjective and objective assessments were conducted. Prior to imaging, participants were shown individual masked trials and were asked to report “anything and everything that you see.” No participant reported seeing words, and most simply reported that they saw rapidly flashing strings of pound signs or percent signs. After the three runs were completed, subjects again were questioned about what they experienced and then completed a brief questionnaire in which both words that had been presented in each of the three word priming conditions and an equal number of words that had not been presented were listed. Participants were told that during the task they had been exposed periodically to words and were asked to indicate whether they believed each word had been presented or not. No participant performed significantly beyond chance levels in identifying presented vs. not-presented words. 


#### fMRI parameters and data processing 
  
Functional images sensitive to blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast were acquired using an inverse spiral pulse sequence (TR, 1.5 s; TE, 35 ms; FOV, 24 cm; image matrix, 64 ; 34 contiguous axial slices; voxel size 3.75 × 3.75 × 3.8 mm) on the research-dedicated 3.0 Tesla GE Signa EXCITE HD system at Duke's Brain Imaging and Analysis Center (BIAC:  ). The 3.0 T has an eight-channel head coil for parallel imaging at high bandwidth up to 1 MHz, in addition to its volume birdcage head coil. Each of the three runs consisted of the acquisition of a time series of 242 brain volumes (TR = 1.5 s, run length = 363 s). Four initial RF excitations were performed (and discarded) to achieve steady state equilibrium. High-resolution structural images were acquired using a 3D fast SPGR pulse sequence (TR, 12.2 ms; TE, 5.3 ms; FOV, 24 cm; image matrix, 256 ; voxel size 0.9375 × 0.9375 × 1.9 mm). A semi-automated high-order shimming program was used to ensure global field homogeneity. 

Analyses of the BOLD signal were conducted using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool; Smith et al.,  ; Woolrich et al.,  ), part of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library, Oxford University;  ). The following pre-statistics processing steps were applied: motion correction using MCFLIRT, slice-timing correction, removal of non-brain voxels using BET, spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 8 mm, and high-pass temporal filtering with a cutoff of 100 s. Registration to high resolution and standard images was carried out using FLIRT. 


#### Statistical analyses 
  
Analyses were conducted to identify regions reliably activated by ideal and ought goal priming respectively, and each proceeded in three stages. First, preprocessed functional data were analyzed using a general linear model with local autocorrelation correction (Woolrich et al.,  ). For each run, we set up separate regressors for promotion (ideal), prevention (ought), yoked-control, and non-word primes. A nuisance regressor modeled the target detection component of the task. All regressors consisted of unit impulses convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. The contrast of interests were comparing ideal vs. control and ought vs. control priming. We then combined data across runs for each subject using a fixed-effects model, and combined data across subjects using a mixed-effects model (Beckmann et al.,  ; Woolrich et al.,  ). We also used the mixed-effects models to obtain statistical tests for whether the two individual differences measures of interest (promotion/prevention success and BAS/BIS strength) and the dysphoric/anxious symptom index significantly modulated activation following goal priming. All   z  -statistic (Gaussianised   t  ) images were thresholded using clusters determined by   z   > 2.3 and a corrected cluster-significance threshold of   p   < 0.05 (Worsley,  ). As Brodmann labels can be somewhat misleading (Zilles and Amunts,  ), we report probabilistic anatomical labels for local maxima within statistically significant clusters derived from the Harvard-Oxford Cortical and Subcortical Structural Atlases along with approximate Brodmann areas. 




## Results 
  
### BOLD activation: promotion > control priming 
  
We analyzed the fMRI data for promotion goal priming by contrasting responses to ideal priming with responses to yoked-control priming. As shown in Table  ; Figure  , we found two brain regions that responded significantly more in response to ideal primes than to yoked-control primes, constituting main effects for promotion priming. The first cluster included occipital pole and lingual gyrus (both bilateral, approximately BA 18). The second cluster, predominantly left-sided, included subcallosal cortex (approximately BA 11/25), caudate, and thalamus.

 Rapid masked promotion and prevention goal priming induced distinct patterns of activation. (A)   To identify brain regions associated with activation of a promotion goal, we contrasted ideal goal priming vs. control priming. There was a significant effect for promotion goal priming in both subcallosal cortex and lingual gyrus (shown in blue). Likewise, to identify brain regions associated with activation of a prevention goal, we contrasted ought goal priming vs. control priming. There was a significant effect for prevention goal priming in precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus (shown in red).   (B)   The chart displays mean standardized parameter estimates (PEs) at selected sites for the ideal vs. control contrast as well as the ought vs. control contrast. Within the subcallosal cortex (  x   − 10,   y  26,   z   − 10), activation was significant greater in response to ideal priming (vs. control priming). Within the precuneus (  x   − 32,   y  14,   z  46), activation was significantly greater in response to ought priming (vs. control priming). 
  
We then repeated the analysis including covariates representing individual differences in self-regulation, BAS/BIS, and current level of dysphoric/anxious symptoms (see below) to determine whether responses to ideal priming were modulated by any of these variables. There were no significant findings for BAS or BIS strength, but we found two areas in which activation for ideal primes compared to yoked-control primes increased as individuals reported   higher   levels of success attaining   promotion   goals (Table  ; Figure  ). The first cluster included bilateral precuneus cortex (approximately BA 7) and bilateral posterior and anterior cingulate cortex (approximately BA 23 and 31). The second cluster included bilateral caudate and thalamus.

 BOLD responses to promotion goal priming were modulated by individual differences in self-reported success pursuing promotion goals and by scores on the symptom index. (A)   For the ideal > control contrast, symptom index scores were positively correlated with activation in frontal pole and paracingulate gyrus.   (B)   The scatterplot displays mean standardized PEs at the right frontal pole (  x  8,   y  40,   z  52) as a function of symptom index scores.   (C)   For the ideal > control contrast, promotion success scores were positively correlated with activation in precuneus, posterior cingulate, and other regions.   (D)   The scatterplot displays mean standardized PEs at the left precuneus (  x   − 8,   y   − 74,   z  36) as a function of promotion success scores. 
  

### BOLD activation: prevention > control priming 
  
We analyzed the fMRI data for prevention goal priming by contrasting responses to ought priming with responses to yoked-control priming. As shown in Table  ; Figure  , we found a cluster comprised of two subregions constituting main effects of prevention priming that responded significantly more to ought primes than to yoked-control primes: left and right precuneus cortex (approximately BA 7) and left and right posterior cingulate gyrus (approximately BA 31). 

We then repeated the analysis including the covariates described above. Again there were no significant findings for BAS or BIS strength, but we found a cluster in which response to ought primes relative to yoked-control primes increased as individuals reported   higher   levels of success attaining   prevention   goals (Table  ; Figure  ). That cluster, which was entirely right-sided, included lateral occipital cortex (approximately BA 7), angular gyrus (approximately BA 40), precuneus cortex (approximately BA 31), and superior parietal lobule (also approximately BA 7). We also found a cluster in which response to ought primes relative to yoked-control primes increased as individuals reported   lower   levels of success attaining   promotion   goals. That cluster, which was entirely left-sided, included superior frontal gyrus (approximately BA 8) and middle frontal gyrus (approximately BA 6). 
  
 BOLD responses to prevention goal priming were modulated by individual differences in self-reported success pursuing both types of personal goals. (A)   For the ought > control contrast, promotion success scores were negatively correlated with activation in middle (MFG) and superior frontal gyrus.   (B)   The scatterplot displays mean standardized PEs at the left middle frontal gyrus (  x   − 32,   y  14,   z  46) as a function of promotion success scores.   (C)   For the ought > control contrast, prevention success scores were positively correlated with activation in lateral occipital cortex (LOC) and other regions.   (D)   The scatterplot displays mean standardized PEs at the right LOC (  x  36,   y   − 70,   z  54) as a function of prevention success scores. 
  

### Goal priming BOLD responses modulation by negative affect 
  
In order to determine whether responses to ideal priming were modulated by current distress level, we also included the dysphoric/anxious index within the ideal vs. control contrast analysis as a covariate. As shown in Table  , we found a cluster that showed a significantly greater response to ideal primes than to yoked-control primes as individuals reported higher levels of negative affect. This bilateral cluster included the frontal pole (approximately BA 8) and paracingulate gyrus (approximately BA 9 and 10). There were no regions identified in this analysis where activation was negatively correlated with the symptom index. We also had included the dysphoric/anxious index as a covariate within the ought vs. control contrast. However, we found no regions where there was significantly greater activation in response to ought vs. yoked-control priming as a function of negative affect.

## Discussion 
  
Despite their centrality for behavior, motivation, mood, and identity, only recently have personal goals such as hopes, dreams, and obligations been examined from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. Personal goals are similar to more concrete, situation-specific goals in that they frequently entail either approach or avoidance, but they are distinct with regard to their abstractness, their motivational significance, and their centrality to the self. In this study, we explored the neural correlates of two classes of personal goals: promotion goals, which represent desired outcomes that an individual would attain by “making good things happen,” and prevention goals, which also represent desired outcomes but which are attained by “keeping bad things from happening.” Using rapid masked priming with idiographically selected ideal and ought goals (both of which are desired personal attributes), we observed distinct neural activation patterns for the two goal types. In addition, we found that activation following goal priming is modulated by individual differences in perceived success of promotion and prevention goal attainment (but not BAS/BIS strength) as well as by current level of negative affect. Promotion and prevention goals have distinct neural correlates, in keeping with the behavioral distinctions between the two hypothesized motivational systems. 

The activation patterns from the ideal > control and ought > control contrasts were reliably distinguishable and were most closely associated with the cortical midline structures model of the self (Northoff and Bermpohl,  ). Nonetheless, it may be more accurate to say that priming of ideal and ought goals activated regions known to be associated with a key psychological process that RFT would predict is relevant: namely, the representation of desired outcomes for the self. We did not observe activation of regions most frequently associated with responses to spatiotemporal cues for either reward (e.g., ventral striatum) or threat (e.g., amygdala). Thus, the data are more consistent with a model organized primarily around personal goals as aspects of identity than a model of approach/avoidance or positive/negative affectivity. Of course, this could reflect the paradigm itself, particularly since our intent was to examine goal priming   per se   rather than a more extended cycle of ongoing self-evaluation triggered by the presence of a discrete cue for reward or threat. 

We observed that promotion goal priming led to activation in frontal and occipital regions as well as caudate and thalamus, whereas prevention goal priming was associated with activation in precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, individual differences in self-perceived success vs. failure to attain promotion and prevention goals were correlated with activation in specific regions that were differentially responsive to promotion vs. prevention goal priming. For those individuals with higher scores on the promotion success scale, the ideal > control contrast was associated with activation in additional regions including bilateral precuneus and both anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (proximal to, but not identical to, the loci observed for the main effect of the ought > control contrast). For participants scoring higher on the prevention success scale, ought goal priming was associated with activation in right occipital and parietal regions. Additionally, a correlation was observed between lower scores on the promotion success scale and left prefrontal activation following priming with ought goals. 

The differences in activation observed for the two classes of personal goals were striking given that both sets of stimuli were self-generated by participants, both were self-descriptive, both were positively valenced, and both represented the kind of person the individual wanted to become. The only difference between the two stimulus sets was the kind of personal goal they represented—in one case (ideal), the individual's hopes, aspirations, and desired accomplishments, and in the other (ought), the individual's sense of duties, obligations, and responsibilities. In fact the same personal goal—for instance, to be successful—could be a promotion goal for one person and a prevention goal for another. RFT would predict that in such an instance, although the goal itself is identical, the motivational impetus, cognitive strategies, behavioral means, and affective responses to goal pursuit would differ radically. For the former individual, being successful would be attained by a strategic emphasis on accomplishment or being the best one could be, whereas for the latter, being successful would be attained by meeting one's responsibilities and obligations. Our findings provide evidence that the distinction between promotion and prevention goals is evident in terms of neural correlates from the moment such a goal is activated by a contextual cue. 

The activation patterns associated with each type of personal goal involved regions within the cortical midline structures associated with self-referential processing as well as regions linked to other aspects of self-regulation (Amodio and Frith,  ; Beer et al.,  ; Heatherton,  ). For example, promotion goal priming-activated areas within orbital and medial PFC, both of which have been reliably demonstrated to be linked to a range of self-referential mental processes, including representation and monitoring of self-referential knowledge (Northoff and Bermpohl,  ). Promotion priming also was associated with activation in the caudate and thalamus, which have been identified as components of both intuition and implicit learning as well as broader networks underlying reward sensitivity, preparatory motor functions, social judgment, and goal pursuit behavior (e.g., Lieberman,  ; Rameson et al.,  ). The greater caudate activation associated with ideal priming among high-success individuals also may reflect the role of the caudate in reward learning and appetitive goal pursuit. Thus, ideals may engage regions that subserve representation and pursuit of abstract positive outcomes via direct, task-focused activity. In contrast, prevention goal priming was associated with activation in precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus, which are implicated in the default mode network (e.g., Buckner et al.,  ) but also in phenomena such as self-reflection, self-awareness, and social adaptation (Pearson et al.,  ). As such, oughts may engage regions that support third-person perspective and moral reasoning. 

Do the observed findings correspond to our knowledge of how individuals represent and pursue their goals? Given the likelihood that human psychological capabilities evolved in response to an increasingly complex social environment (Leary,  ), activities such as the pursuit of personal goals would of necessity incorporate cognitive processes involving representations of self and significant others (Derryberry and Reed,  ). In order for humans to survive and thrive, they must be not only capable of effective responses to survival-relevant stimuli. They also must be capable of representing and pursuing higher-order, cross-situational, socially embedded goals, and the representational, monitoring, and evaluative functions required must be integrated into coherent brain/behavior systems (Mischel,  ). For the higher-order personal goals that people pursue, there is no necessarily spatiotemporal “moving toward or away from”; rather, the strategies people use involve “bringing about” or “making happen” (Carver and Scheier,  ). This phenomenological distinction raises the possibility that brain/behavior systems for   strategic   approach and avoidance, such as are postulated in RFT, would be functionally discriminable from those for spatiotemporal approach and avoidance. For example, personal goals such as being successful, or intelligent, or trustworthy require a top-down coordination that brings relevant concrete goal representations into working memory across a range of situations (Carver and Scheier,  ). The present data could be interpreted as reflecting how such top-down coordination is manifested differentially within the brain when promotion or prevention self-regulation is engaged. 

Our findings were somewhat different from those reported by Eddington et al. ( ,  ), especially in the case of promotion priming, where left orbital prefrontal activation was found to be discriminantly associated with promotion goal cues which had been presented in the context of a self-reference judgment task. We see the distinctions between the two sets of findings as primarily reflecting differences in the experimental paradigm used. Eddington et al. ( ,  ) used a task that had been designed to identify neural signatures of explicit self-referential processing; they simply included a set of idiographically selected ideal and ought attributes within the stimuli used for the judgment task. Their findings, in essence, revealed a promotion-goal-specific activation pattern which was embedded within an instructional set emphasizing self-descriptiveness and requiring a specific judgment. In contrast, the rapid masked priming paradigm in the present study was selected so that goal-related activation patterns could be observed without the potentially complicating factor of an explicit self-evaluation in reference to the goal being primed. The distinction between the activation patterns found by Eddington and colleagues and those observed in the present study warrants additional study. 

Based on these findings, does RFT help to refine our knowledge of the brain regions involved in the representation of personal goals? We suggest that in terms of the postulated distinctions between promotion and prevention, the answer is a qualified yes. The psychological dynamics of the promotion system can be viewed in signal detection terms (Tanner and Swets,  ; Trope and Liberman,  ), particularly as involving eagerness, which increases with greater proximity (in this case, conceptually or symbolically rather than spatiotemporally) to the target (Higgins,  ). As such, we postulate that self-reflection may be less central to promotion-based goal pursuit, since promotion goals “loom larger” as the individual gets closer to attaining them (Higgins,  ), and indeed we did not observe main effects of promotion-triggered activation in posterior midline structures associated with self-reflective thought. 

Prevention system dynamics also can be viewed in signal detection terms, with the system organized to avoid errors of commission (albeit still in the service of ultimately attaining a positive end-state). As such, the prevention system relies upon vigilance as the dominant motivational state and self-evaluation as a recursive cognitive process. Consistent with this characterization, prevention goal priming was associated with activation in areas engaged by tasks that require self-reflection and even self-awareness, as well as by decisions involving judgments of morality and principle (e.g., Greene and Haidt,  ). Such processes are of primary relevance to the pursuit of personal goals that are construed in terms of obligation, responsibility, or a sense of “should” (Higgins,  ). 

Of course, the findings do not represent a self-contained set of brain/behavior systems associated with personal goal pursuit. Self-regulation is too complex and multifaceted to be modeled adequately by a single experimental task. It would have been unlikely to find activation in areas associated with psychological processes that are substantially “downstream” from goal activation, such as consummatory behavior, goal disengagement, or affect regulation. Nonetheless, the activation patterns immediately following promotion and prevention goal priming were discriminable, and the rapid masked priming technique provided sufficient sensitivity to detect those patterns—which appeared to be broadly consistent with RFT's conceptualizations for each system. 

We also observed that individual differences in self-reported success pursuing a particular kind of goal predicted activation following priming with idiographic exemplars of such goals, whereas individual differences in temperament-based approach and avoidance tendencies (operationalized using the Carver and White BIS/BAS Scales) did not. The behavioral activation and inhibition systems are hypothesized to represent inborn, presumably genetically determined variation in sensitivity to cues for spatiotemporal approach/avoidance behavior and/or the intensity and duration of behavioral responses to such cues. In contrast, individual differences in the strength of the promotion and prevention systems have been linked to socialization (Manian et al.,  ), and in particular to variability in the messages parents convey to their children about the relative importance of making good things happen vs. keeping bad things from happening. Strauman and Wilson ( ) postulated that the two sets of systems have different phylogenetic and developmental origins as well as distinguishable functions. Whereas BAS and BIS appear to operate in response to immediate, concrete cues for reward and danger respectively, promotion and prevention operate as “world views” or cognitive styles and provide a functional link between pursuit of higher-order personal goals and the social world. Eddington et al. ( ) reported that the Carver and White scales did not predict neural responses to promotion or prevention goal priming, and the present data are in concordance with their findings. Together, the two studies provide evidence that the neurobiological bases of BAS/BIS and promotion/prevention are likely to be distinct—and offer the possibility that the two sets of systems interact in complex ways to influence goal-directed behavior in any specific situation. 

Both RFT and its precursor, self-discrepancy theory (Higgins,  ), predict that perceived lack of progress toward a motivationally significant personal goal would be associated with negative affect. Both theories also postulate that chronic distress, as well as emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety, can interfere with effective goal pursuit (Strauman,  ). To explore the impact of negative affect on personal goal activation, we examined whether individual variability in negative affect (assessed by creating a dysphoric/anxious index from the BDI and STAI) would predict neural responses to promotion or prevention goal priming. For individuals reporting greater levels of distress, promotion priming was associated with additional activation in the bilateral frontal pole and paracingulate gyrus. Prevention goal priming did not reveal any regions where activation was modulated by self-reported distress. 

What might this pattern of results signify about the influence of chronic distress on self-regulation? Level of negative affect was associated with greater recruitment of bilateral frontal regions in response to cues for “making good things happen,” suggesting that higher levels of distress could introduce a greater degree of recruitment of prefrontal regions in the goal pursuit process. More speculatively, such increased frontal activity could signify activation of negative cognitive schemas, as hypothesized in cognitive models of depression (e.g., Beck et al.,  ), which would be likely to interfere with effective strategic pursuit of promotion goals. The nature of the promotion system dictates that the individual's optimal strategy is to ignore errors or unsuccessful trials and continue with goal pursuit efforts. Too much engagement of self-evaluation would complicate goal pursuit efforts by diverting processing resources away from the eager motivational state that characterizes successful promotion goal pursuit. The study was not intended to explore clinically relevant emotional states and symptom patterns, and it may be premature to extrapolate these findings to depression and related internalizing disorders. Still, the modulation of neural response to ideal priming by negative affect was robust enough to emerge from an analysis that included other statistically significant covariates. 

In summary, the rapid masked stimulus presentation technique that we used to prime participants' promotion and prevention goals led to interpretable and reliably distinguishable patterns of neural activation. The findings are broadly consistent with established findings from the social neuroscience literature, and the discriminability of the activation patterns associated with the two types of personal goals provides support for the critical distinction in RFT between promotion and prevention as modes of self-regulation. To the extent that those modes become automatic and systematized over time, then perhaps it will be of value to speak of promotion and prevention “systems” assuming that present data are replicated using other goal-relevant tasks. Furthermore, to the extent that individual differences relevant to self-regulation of personal goal pursuit might be expected to influence the strength and accessibility of the two systems, our findings also were consistent with the view that the neural correlates of the systems may differ as a function of individuals' beliefs about their success vs. failure in attaining such goals. 

We close with several comments about the limitations of the present research and its potential implications for future studies. As noted previously, the priming paradigm may be a reasonable operationalization of one phase of a self-regulatory cycle—automatic activation of goal pursuit via exposure to a goal-relevant cue—but it would not be likely to identify neural responses to other phases of that cycle, such as regulation of affect in response to goal pursuit feedback or other conscious processes. Likewise, we did not systematically choose the participants on the basis of potentially relevant individual differences, and the priming task did not explicitly target such individual variability. Our analyses of those individual differences (in regulatory focus, in BAS/BIS strength, and in chronic distress) are correlational and represent first steps in an ongoing process of investigation. It should be emphasized that the promotion and prevention systems are constructs, in the same way as more familiar brain/behavior systems. We are using those constructs to guide prediction and interpretation but not making claims about neural structure or neuroanatomical connectivity. Nonetheless, we offer these findings as, to our knowledge, the first neuroimaging evidence for the construct validity of the promotion and prevention systems and the critical roles that individual differences and chronic affective states play in the day-to-day function of those systems.

# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
Frustrating situations are encountered daily, and it is necessary to respond in an adaptive fashion. A psychological definition states that adaptive social behaviors are “self-performing” and “contain a solution.” The present study investigated the neural correlates of adaptive social responses to frustrating situations by assessing the dimension of causal attribution. Based on attribution theory, internal causality refers to one’s aptitudes that cause natural responses in real-life situations, whereas external causality refers to environmental factors, such as experimental conditions, causing such responses. To investigate the issue, we developed a novel approach that assesses causal attribution under experimental conditions. During fMRI scanning, subjects were required to engage in virtual frustrating situations and play the role of protagonists by verbalizing social responses, which were socially adaptive or non-adaptive. After fMRI scanning, the subjects reported their causal attribution index of the psychological reaction to the experimental condition. We performed a correlation analysis between the causal attribution index and brain activity. We hypothesized that the brain region whose activation would have a positive and negative correlation with the self-reported index of the causal attributions would be regarded as neural correlates of internal and external causal attribution of social responses, respectively. 


## Results 
  
We found a significant negative correlation between external causal attribution and neural responses in the right anterior temporal lobe for adaptive social behaviors. 


## Conclusion 
  
This region is involved in the integration of emotional and social information. These results suggest that, particularly in adaptive social behavior, the social demands of frustrating situations, which involve external causality, may be integrated by a neural response in the right anterior temporal lobe. 

 

# Body
 
## Background 
  
We often encounter frustrating situations in our social lives. The following situation is an example: You are inputting data into your computer. Suddenly, the screen goes black, and soon after, your colleague holds up a plug and says, “I’m sorry; I accidently unplugged your PC” (Figure  a, b). Rosenzweig created a model for the verbal responses to such frustrating situations, which was implemented in a widely used questionnaire, the “Picture-Frustration Study” (PF Study) [ , ]. In Rosenzweig’s model, verbal responses to the frustrating situation are classified by two factors: the direction and type of aggression [ , ]. The direction of aggression involves requests towards self, another person, and nothing, and the types of aggression include attention to the frustrating event itself, to a cause of the frustrating situation, and to a solution to the frustrating situation. 

Social adaptation is a crucial aspect of such social responses. Also in Rosenzweig’s model, social adaptation of verbal responses is assessed by the Group Conformity Rating (GCR), which represents the degree to which these responses conform to common sense. However, the definition of social adaptation in this model was quite ambiguous, because “common sense” may differ across cultures. One clear definition of adaptation, drawn from coping theory [ , ], is the process used to manage environmental demands and to solve the problem that caused the frustrating situation without putting a burden on the environment. Corresponding to this definition [ , ], an adaptive response in Rosenzweig’s model is one with a request to self (self-performing) that contains a solution [ ]. In the above-mentioned example of a frustrating situation, verbal responses such as “You need to re-input the data” (other-performing) or “I should have saved the data” (no solution) are non-adaptive because they do not manage the environmental demand to finish the data input (containing a solution), nor do they avoid putting a burden on the environment (self-performing). In this case, a verbal response such as “I will input the data again” is an adaptive social response because it suggests self-performing behavior (i.e., action by one’s self) and manages the environmental demands with a solution (i.e., to input the data again). 

Causal attribution is another key dimension of adaptive social responses. Attribution theory suggests that causal attribution in social behavior has an external–internal dimension [ ]. Internal causality identifies one’s aptitude as causing natural responses, whereas external causality identifies environmental factors as causing less natural responses [ ]. Here, we hypothesized that natural and less natural responses were related to internal and external causal attributions, respectively. Assessment of the external–internal dimension of the causal attributions in adaptive social responses is important in areas of clinical psychology such as motivational interviewing [ ], where the goal is to change clients’ behavior [ , ]. This technique has been used alter smoking behavior [ ], alcohol consumption [ ], and drug addiction [ ], as well as to promote diet/exercise therapy for patients with obesity [ ] and/or diabetes [ ]. The goal of a motivational interview with such clients is to evoke an internal causal attribution to change counterproductive to adaptive behavior [ ]. Thus, an objective assessment tool for the external–internal dimension of the causal attribution underlying adaptive social responses would be useful in the clinical setting. Recent development of a visual cortex decoding device using neuroimaging techniques, [ ] indicates that neuroimaging studies have the potential to provide objective assessment tools for the clinical setting. 

Although the dimension of causal attribution is a critical aspect of social adaptation, the neural correlates of causal attributions in adaptive social responses are not well understood. Several neuroimaging studies have investigated social adaptation in terms of moral cognition and social norms (for review, see [ , ]). In paticular, Moll et al. [ ] reported that neural activity in the fronto–temporal areas was involved in moral judgment and moral sensitivity [ ]. Berthoz et al. [ ] demonstrated that the medial frontal and anterior temporal regions were activated during transgression of a social norm. In terms of causal attributions, Spitzer et al. [ ] investigated the neural correlates of social norm compliance induced by punishment by others, which is thought to be associated with external causal attributions, and suggested that the bilateral orbitofrontal cortices and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were involved in compliance with social norms [ ]. Recent fMRI studies have focused on the neural correlates of causal attributions made in social situations. Blackwood et al. [ ] reported pre-motor cortex and cerebellar involvement in internal causal attributions, and Seidel et al. [ ] showed that, compared with external attribution, internal causal attribution induced activation in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and external attribution induced activation in the left TPJ and precuneus. Previous neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of either social adaptation or causal attribution in social situations; however, no studies have examined causal attribution in relation to social adaptation. 

The present study aimed to identify the neural correlates underlying adaptive social responses to a frustrating situation by assessing causal attributions. To this end, we created an “acting task” that applied frustrating situations to Rosenzweig’s model. We also used a parametric index of the self-reported social behavior causal attributions that was based on the work of Blackwood et al. and Seidel et al. [ , ]. We refer to this index as a “causality score,” and applied it to the acting task to assess causal attributions related to the social responses exhibited under the experimental conditions. During the acting task, each subject was presented with a virtual frustrating situation and was asked to play the role of the protagonist by verbalizing social responses (Figure  ) that were either socially adaptive or non-adaptive (Table  , Figure  ) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Following fMRI scans, subjects were asked to evaluate their own causality scores, which indicated the likelihood that they would have responded to the social situation in the same way as the protagonist in the virtual frustrating situation (i.e., internal causal attribution). The causality score was used as an index of the internal causal attribution of the described social response. We assumed that causality scores would differ across trials during the acting task. We hypothesized that the brain region whose activation would have a positive and negative correlation with the self-reported index of the causal attributions would be regarded as neural correlates of internal and external causal attribution of social responses, respectively. In other words, the brain region whose neural activity during verbalization of a more natural response (i.e., internal causality) would be associated with higher causality scores than those during verbalization of a less natural social response (i.e., external causality).

(  c  ) The OW response describes another’s behavior in the near future. (  d  ) The OWo response describes another’s behavior in the past. (  e  ) The Co (control) condition only describes the situation. 
  
For behavioral results, we predicted that the causality scores of the adaptive social responses would correlate significantly with the results of the psychological questionnaire scales associated with character and aggressive behavior because responses to frustrating situations are affected by individual levels of social cooperation and correspond to features of aggressive behavior [ ]. In particular, we predicted that the causality scores for adaptive verbal responses would correlate with the cooperativeness (C) subscale of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) [ ] and the anger control subscale of the State–Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) [ ], which evaluates socially cooperative characteristics and self-control over angry behavior, respectively. 

We predicted that the fMRI results would show involvement of the premotor cortex, cerebellum, and right TPJ in natural social responses because these areas play a role in internal causal attribution in social situations [ , ]. We expected the left TPJ and precuneus to be associated with less natural social responses because activity in these regions is associated with external causal attribution [ , ]. Furthermore, the processing underpinning social adaptation involves a wide variety of brain regions, including the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices, anterior and posterior superior temporal sulcus, and TPJ [ , ]. Thus, we predicted that the right and left TPJ would be involved in the internal and external causal attributions made about adaptive social responses to frustrating situations, respectively. 


## Methods 
  
### Subjects 
  
In total, 40 healthy volunteers (eight females, 32 males; mean age 20.5 years,   SD   = 2.4, range, 18–28) participated. All participants were native Japanese speakers recruited from the Tohoku University community and all were right-handed, as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ]. No subject had a history of neurological, psychiatric, or major medical disorders. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [ ]. The current study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tohoku University. 


### Stimuli 
  
Each real-life frustrating situation was presented in text form and was followed by presentation a picture taken from the first-person perspective of the participant (Figure  a, b). Each picture contained a message to the protagonist from the person responsible for the frustrating situation. The participant’s verbal response to the frustrating situation (expressed either to the person responsible for the situation or to one’s self) was then presented as a sentence on the picture (Figure  c). This sequence was referred to as “a stimulus sequence” (Figure  ). The individual whose photograph appears in the example provided written informed consent for publication of his photograph. 

To test the specificity of a significant correlation in adaptive social behaviors, it is necessary to compare adaptive and non-adaptive verbal responses. We referred to stimulus sequences with both adaptive and non-adaptive responses to the same frustrating situation as “a stimulus set” (Figure  ). To prepare the stimulus sets for our acting task, preliminary experiments were conducted in three steps: (1) collection of stimulus sequences including frustrating situations and verbal responses in daily life; (2) categorization of adaptive and non-adaptive responses, which constituted a stimulus set; and (3) verification of the stimulus sets. 

In the first step, to elicit honest verbal responses to daily frustrating situations, a separate group of subjects from the Tohoku University community, the same community from which participants in the present study were selected, anonymously completed our original questionnaire asking about daily frustrating situations in their lives as college students and possible verbal responses they would give in such situations. As a result, we identified 41 frustrating situations and seven or eight verbal responses for each situation (a total of 306 verbal responses). Then we obtained 41 pictures, either from the internet or by taking the pictures ourselves, which illustrated 41 frustrating situations. 

Seventeen healthy subjects (three women, 14 men; 19–25 years old) were tested separately in the second step. Each subject looked at every stimulus sequence. They were then asked to “imagine being the protagonist in each frustrating situation and evaluate how naturally they would utter a prepared response.” The evaluation of each verbal response was used as a reference for the “causality” scores. To categorize the different types of verbal responses, we performed a discriminant analysis using the SPSS software (ver. 15.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The causality scores were used as independent variables in the discriminant analysis because the effect of the different verbal responses on the causality scores differed among individuals. 

Additionally, we wanted to use an experimental approach to demonstrate that the two factors of adaptation (i.e., “self-performing” and “containing a solution”) were significant explanations for the verbal responses to the frustrating situations. Based on this analysis, verbal responses were divided into four categories by two discriminant functions that accounted for 95.3% of the variance. 

The functions were two types of verbal responses to the frustrating situation; these were referred to as performer (self/other-performing) and solution (with/without solution), corresponding to the direction and type of aggression in the Rosenzweig model, respectively [ ]. We categorized these two factors into four types of verbal responses (Table  ): self-performing/with solution (SW), self-performing/without solution (SWo), other-performing/with solution (OW), and other-performing/without solution (OWo). In this context, the SW response satisfied the definition of adaptation as a process used to manage environmental demands [ , ] because the SW response does not suggest that a burden will be placed on the environment. As a result of dividing the verbal responses into four categories, the stimulus set contained each frustrating situation, four verbal responses for the conditions of interest (SW, SWo, OW, and OWo; Table  ), and one response as a control condition (Co; Figure  ). Under the Co condition, each subject read the description of the situation itself instead of the verbal responses. 

In the third step, a preliminary psychological test conducted with 10 different healthy subjects (five women, five men, 19–29 years old) was used to verify the stimulus set. We eliminated responses understood by fewer than 90% of the subjects. Accordingly, 16 stimulus sets including four types of verbal responses met this criterion (see, Additional file  , Appendix). The means and standard deviations of the length of the verbal responses were 11.9 ± 1.4, 13.1 ± 1.8, 12.4 ± 1.7, 13.0 ± 2.2, and 13.1 ± 1.4 moras (a prosodic unit of the Japanese language) under the SW, SWo, OW, OWo, and Co conditions, respectively. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant difference in the average length of the responses across conditions [  F  (4,75) = 1.68]. Accordingly, we assumed that behavioral outputs, such as the speech and eye movements required for reading the verbal responses, were similar across conditions. 


### Task 
  
Prior to the fMRI experiment, subjects practiced the acting task outside the scanner with four stimulus sets not used in the experiment. The subjects then viewed all the stimulus sequences without verbal responses to ensure that they could understand the frustrating situations. 

During the fMRI experiment, each subject performed the acting task. Subjects acted as protagonists (i.e., as if they had been in the situation presented in the stimulus picture) by reading a verbal response with feeling. By fixing the headphones between the head coil and the temple areas, head motions were dissociated from jaw movements during reading. To record the entirety of the response, subjects were asked to press a button with their right index fingers while reading the verbal response aloud. A mixed design was applied to this fMRI experiment. To allow a parametric modulation analysis for each trial [ ], the inter-trial intervals varied from 0 to 3.5 s, as in an event-related model. Because our primary objective was to have subjects act out the task, we used a block design to decrease the load involved in switching among different types of verbal responses. In brief, four trials using the same type of verbal responses were arranged in a block design. The details of the task procedure are shown in Figure  . 
  
 Task procedure.   (  a  ) At the start of each block, a text cue indicating which type of verbal response was to be adopted was presented for 3 s. (  b  ) In each trial, a general explanation was presented for 2 s. (  c  ) The picture stimulus was then shown for 2 s, and (  d  ) the verbal response was elicited for 4 s. The subjects were asked to read the verbal response soon after it appeared and to press a button with their right index finger while reading. (  e  ) The intertrial interval (ITI) varied from 0 to 3.5 s. (  f  ) Four trials with the same types of verbal responses were presented in one block. The duration of each block was 43.5 s. The interval between blocks was 6.5 s, during which time a central fixation cross (+) was presented to signal the resting condition. Eighty stimuli (16 stimulus sets, 20 blocks) were presented while subjects underwent fMRI scanning; the order of stimuli and blocks were counterbalanced among subjects. The entire scanning time was 17 min, 20 s. 
  

### Causality scores 
  
After fMRI scanning, the subjects were presented with all of the verbal responses to the frustrating situations outside the scanner. The subjects were not informed of this task prior to scanning. They were asked to evaluate the similarity between the verbal responses given in the scanner and their natural responses to real-life situations using a nine-point scale (1: not at all natural and 9: very natural); these were referred to as causality scores. Subjects were asked to evaluate causality after the fMRI task because an evaluation during scanning may have interfered with their ability to fully immerse themselves in role playing. The causality score was defined as an index of the internal causal attribution of the described response to the hypothetical scenario. Consistent with this definition, when verbalizing a more natural response (i.e., internal causality), the subjects’ causality scores would be higher than when verbalizing a less natural response (i.e., reflecting external causality). 


### Psychological measurements 
  
All subjects completed the Japanese version of the STAXI [ ] and the Japanese version of the TCI [ ]. The STAXI assesses the intensity of feelings of anger (state anger), the disposition to experience anger (trait anger), behaviorally expressed anger (anger-out), suppressed anger (anger-in), and self-control of anger behaviors (anger-control) [ ]. The TCI has four independent temperament dimensions (novelty-seeking, harm-avoidance, reward-dependence, and persistence) and three independent character dimensions (self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence) [ ]. Self-directedness refers to the ability to control one’s own behavior to achieve one’s own goals. Cooperativeness refers to acceptance of others, which induces socially adaptive behaviors such as social tolerance, helpfulness, and compassion. Self-transcendence is related to a kind of spirituality associated with the notion that everything is an essential and consequential part of the universe [ , ]. 


### fMRI measurement 
  
Transaxial gradient-echo images (number of slices = 44, echo time = 50 ms, flip angle = 90°, slice thickness = 2.2 mm, slice gap = 0.7 mm, FOV = 192 mm, and matrix = 64 × 64) covering the whole cerebrum were acquired at a repetition time of 4000 ms using an echo planar sequence and a Siemens Symphony (1.5 T; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) MR scanner. To allow for T1 equilibration effects, eight dummy scans were acquired and subsequently discarded. Additionally, anatomical T1-weighted images (thickness, 1 mm; FOV, 256 mm; data matrix, 192 × 224; TR = 1900 ms; TE = 3.93 ms) were acquired from all participants. 


### Imaging data analysis 
  
The following preprocessing procedures were performed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM2) software (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) and MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA): correction for head motion, adjustment of acquisition-timing across slices, coregistration to the anatomical image, spatial normalization using the anatomical image and the MNI template, and smoothing using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 10 mm. Data from eight subjects (one woman, seven men) with excessive head motion (more than 2 mm) were excluded. Thus, data from 32 subjects were analyzed. 

A conventional two-level approach for fMRI data was adopted using SPM2. We designed two models of expected signal changes for each of the four types of verbal response conditions: canonical signal changes among trials (c: canonical model) and parametrically modulated signal changes correlated with the causality scores within each trial (p: parametric modulation model). The causality scores were normalized to a mean of zero under each condition to orthogonalize the four conditions. Under the Co condition, we designed only a canonical model. A voxel-by-voxel multiple regression analysis of the expected signal changes for each of the nine models (SW-c, SW-p, SWo-c, SWo-p, OW-c, OW-p, OWo-c, OWo-p, and Co) was then applied to the preprocessed images for each subject. The expected signal changes were constructed using the hemodynamic response function provided by SPM2. Parameter estimates from the parametric modulation analysis appeared as the degree of correlation between the causality scores and the signal changes. Statistical inference about the contrast of parameter estimates was performed with the second-level between-subjects (random effect) model using one-sample   t  -tests. The height threshold of all voxel-by-voxel analyses was set at   p   < 0.001, uncorrected, and the extent threshold was set at   p   < 0.05 for multiple comparisons [ , ]. 

First, to identify the neural networks involved in acting out the virtual frustrating situations, we tested the contrast of the parameter estimates of the canonical model under each of the four conditions compared with the Co condition. The neural responses associated with the adaptive social response were identified by testing the contrast of SW versus each of the other three conditions. Second, to identify the neural responses related to natural and less natural social responses to the SW conditions, we used an event-related model to allow for a parametric modulation analysis of each trial [ ] and tested for positive and negative correlations. To exclude the possibility of detecting deactivation correlated with the causality score, we restricted the analyses to the areas in which activation was significant under the SW conditions versus the Co condition (i.e., a mask; p < 0.05, uncorrected). Finally, to examine the specificity of the SW conditions, we performed a paired   t  -test between the SW condition and the three other conditions using parameter estimates of the peak activations of the cluster derived from the parametric modulation analysis. 



## Results 
  
### Behavioral results 
  
The means and standard deviations of the durations recorded for the button press while acting out each condition were 2.16 ± 0.25, 2.27 ± 0.25, 2.20 ± 0.26, 2.29 ± 0.24, and 2.31 ± 0.23 s under the SW, SWo, OW, OWo, and Co conditions, respectively (Table  ). No significant difference in duration was observed among the five conditions [one-way ANOVA;   F  (4,155) = 2.10], suggesting that the behavioral output required for reading the verbal responses was controlled across conditions. 
  
Behavioral data 
  
The duration of the acting task is shown for each condition. No significant difference in duration was observed among the five conditions [one-way ANOVA;   F  (4,155) = 2.10]. Causality scores under the four coping conditions are shown. A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of solution [  F  (1, 31) = 50.47,   p   < 0.05] and a significant interaction [  F  (1, 31) = 12.98,   p   < 0.05].   Post-hoc   paired t-tests revealed that causality scores under the OWo condition were significantly higher than those under the SW [t(31) = -2.81, p < 0.05, Bonferroni correction] and the OW conditions [t(31) = -8.11, p < 0.0001, Bonferroni correction]. Causality scores under the SWo condition were significantly higher than those under the OW condition [t(31) = 5.39, p < 0.0001, Bonferroni correction]. The values are shown as means and standard deviations. SW, self-performing/with solution; SWo, self-performing/without solution; OW, other-performing/with solution; OWo, other-performing/without solution; Co, control condition. 
  
The mean values of the causality scores for each condition were 5.25 ± 1.19, 5.82 ± 0.96, 4.72 ± 1.06, and 6.26 ± 1.30 under the SW, SWo, OW, and OWo conditions, respectively. The two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of solution [  F  (1,31) = 50.47,   p   < 0.05] and a significant interaction [  F  (1,31) = 12.98,   p   < 0.05] (Table  ).   Post hoc   paired   t  -tests revealed that the causality scores under the OWo condition were significantly higher than were those under the SW [  t  (31) = -2.81,   p   < 0.05, Bonferroni correction] and the OW [  t  (31) = -8.11,   p   < 0.0001, Bonferroni correction] conditions, and that those under the SWo condition were significantly higher than were those under the OW condition [  t  (31) = 5.39,   p   < 0.0001, Bonferroni correction]. 

The correlation analysis between the causality scores in each condition and the psychological questionnaire scales revealed a significant positive correlation between the average causality score in the SW conditions and the Anger Control subscale of the STAXI (  r   = 0.43,   p   = 0.014), as expected. Although we did not find a significant positive correlation between the causality scores in the SW conditions and the C subscale of the TCI (  r   = 0.29,   p   = 0.10), the analysis showed the positive tendency we expected. Furthermore, the causality scores in the SWo conditions had a significant positive correlation with the C subscale of the TCI (  r   = 0.37,   p   = 0.037), whereas the causality scores in the OWo conditions were negatively correlated with the C subscale of the TCI (  r   = -0.41,   p   = 0.020). 


### fMRI results 
  
#### Neural correlates of social responses to frustrating situations 
  
The brain regions significantly activated in each of the four conditions, relative to the Co condition, are shown in Table   and Figure  . Statistically significant activation under all conditions relative to the Co condition was observed in the medial prefrontal cortices, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the bilateral temporal lobes, and the bilateral occipital lobes. The OW coping style, but not the other conditions, was associated with significant activation of the dorsal part of the medial prefrontal cortices, the supplementary motor area, the right inferior frontal gyrus, and the parietal lobe. Statistically significant activation in all conditions, with the exception of the SWo coping style, was observed in the bilateral temporoparietal junctions, the orbito-insular junction, the bilateral hippocampus/parahippocampus, and the cerebellum. We found no significant differential activation between the SW and the other three conditions.

### Neural correlates of natural adaptive social responses to frustrating situations 
  
The parametric modulation analysis showed no significant positive correlations between the causality scores and neural responses in any condition. 


### Neural correlates of less natural adaptive social responses to frustrating situations 
  
The parametric modulation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation only between the SW condition causality scores and neural responses in the right anterior temporal lobe (Table  , Figure  a). The parameter estimates showed significant differences between the SW condition and the other three conditions at the peak voxel in this cluster (Table  , Figure  b). The time-series data for the percentage signal change at the peak statistical value in this area showed larger responses for the low-causality scores compared with the medium- and high-causality scores (Figure  c).

## Discussion 
  
The aim of the present study was to identify the neural correlates of adaptive social responses to frustrating situations by assessing causal attributions. We found a significant negative correlation between causality scores and brain activity in the right anterior temporal lobe while acting out adaptive social responses. The negative correlation indicated a less natural social response, suggesting that this region is specifically activated when an adaptive social response is driven by an external causal attribution. 

### Rosenzweig model and social adaptation 
  
We revealed the neural correlates of the specificity of social adaptation based on the Rosenzweig model. In the current experiment, we combined the Rosenzweig model for social responses to frustrating situations [ , ] and social adaptation, proposed according to coping theory [ ]. Through preliminary experiments, we identified two factors that contribute to social responses to frustrating situations, consistent with the Rosenzweig model. However, although the Rosenzweig model is a 3 × 3 factorial design (i.e., direction of aggression involving self, another person, and nothing × type of aggression, involving attention to the frustrating event itself, to the cause of the frustrating situation, and a to solution to the frustrating situation) [ , ], social responses in our results consisted of a 2 × 2 factorial design (i.e., self/other performing × containing/not containing a solution). Logical thought requires that social responses corresponding to self-/other-performing are consistent with those directing aggression toward the self and another person, respectively. However, those corresponding to the direction of aggression involving requests toward nothing were excluded from our stimuli through the discriminant analysis. The number of responses that were requests toward nothing was not sufficient to create a significant category. For the type-of-aggression factor, we could regard those with attention to the frustrating event itself and to a cause of the frustrating situation as “no solution” and regard a solution to the frustrating situation as containing a solution. Although a 3 × 3 factorial design was integrated into a 2 × 2 design, at least two factors of the Rosenzweig model were replicated in the present study. 

Moreover, we found specific neural responses under SW conditions that were related to socially adaptive responses [ ]. In the current study, we focused on the internal (i.e., self-performing) and external (i.e., containing a solution that implicitly responds to external demands) causality of social responses. Adaptive social responses may have a stronger association with external causal attributions than do non-adaptive social responses because the definition of social adaptation [ ] refers to managing environmental demands to solve problems, which corresponds to external causality. Although other definitions of adaptation have been proposed [ , ], the one developed by Lazarus [ ] was congruent with respect to specificity. Therefore, our data showing that a specific neural response was elicited only when adaptive behavior was observed support the appropriateness of the definition proposed by Lazarus [ ] for use in efforts examining the biological underpinnings of socially adaptive responses. 


### Causality scores and psychological measurements 
  
We found a significant correlation between causality scores and responses to the psychological questionnaires. This finding suggests that the internal causal attribution of adaptive social responses (i.e., the SW condition) requires self-control and the ability to control anger behavior in frustrating situations. Moreover, self-performing responses (i.e., the SW and SWo conditions), which put no burden on others, were associated with a cooperative personality. This is in contrast to the OWo condition, which represents a complaining/accusing attitude and is associated with a less cooperative personality. These findings reinforce the validity of the causality scores, as we predicted. 

On the other hand, we observed an apparent discrepancy between the behavioral and fMRI results regarding causality scores. Although we found a significant main effect of solution and a significant interaction in the causality scores among the four conditions, we did not detect a significant main effect or interaction among the parameter estimates derived from the parametric modulation analysis. The results of the parametric modulation model depend on within-subject variation in the causality scores under each condition, whereas the mean values of the causality scores reflect individual variability across subjects. Thus, the result related to the specificity of parameter estimates under the SW condition was robust. 


### Right anterior temporal lobe 
  
Although previous neuroimaging studies have not reported right anterior temporal lobe involvement in causal attributions, the cognitive function of this region highlights the importance of integrated processing for adaptive social behavior. A previous review suggested that the lateral prefrontal cortices contributed to adaptive social reasoning because they had been shown to mediate cognitive functions, such as social exchange, simulation, integration, deductive and inductive inference, and social cognition [ ]. One interpretation of our results is that adaptive social behaviors with an external causal attribution (i.e., less natural social responses) require a high cognitive load for the integration of emotional and social information. Previous studies have shown right anterior temporal lobe involvement in cognitive integration in social contexts. For example, this region was activated during the bottom-up processing of breaches occurring in social contexts, such as social norm violations [ ] and social–cognitive conflicts [ ]. Additionally, this region is involved in the top-down processing of comprehension in a social context, such as moral reasoning [ , ], mentalizing (understanding others’ intentions) [ ], irony [ ], and abstract conceptual knowledge [ ]. Olson et al. argued that the right anterior temporal lobe was involved in the emotional processing associated with social relationships (socio–emotional processing) [ ]. Other reports have suggested that the functional role of the anterior temporal lobe can be understood in terms of its serving as a semantic hub mediating social–emotional processing [ ]. In addition to these cognitive processes, the region plays a role in behavioral processes, such as producing communicative speech in a social context [ ]. Thus, neural activation in this region integrates social stimuli involving the social demands of frustrating situations. Such social demands constitute the characteristics of external causal attribution, particularly in the context of an adaptive social behavior. The functional role of this region highlights the importance of integration in the performance of adaptive social behaviors. 


### Neural networks for social responses to frustrating situations 
  
The neural networks associated with social responses to frustrating situations identified in the present study are consistent with those previously reported in neuroimaging studies investigating social behaviors. These brain areas are part of the brain network that mediates social cognition and behavior [ , ], such as mentalizing [ ], social interaction [ ], and communicative speech production [ ]. Furthermore, they are related to judgments about the adaptiveness of behavior in relation to a social context with regard to considerations such as social norms [ , ] and moral judgments [ , , ]. A comparison of our results with previous findings suggests that subjects must understand the meaning of a social situation to produce communicative speech during the acting task, and that this may be related to environmental demands. 

We failed to find neural correlates of adaptive social responses via conventional subtraction analyses (i.e., contrast between adaptive and non-adaptive responses). On the other hand, after fitting the causality scores, we were able to detect adaptive-specific neural responses. The results indicate that the concept of causality is needed in attempts to identify the neural correlates of adaptive-specific neural responses under experimental conditions. 


### Methodological considerations and future studies 
  
Certain methodological issues in our experiment must be considered. First, the validity of our novel methodology was supported by both psychobehavioral and fMRI results. The correlation between the causality scores and the psychological measures reinforce the validity of the causality scores. Moreover, the significant correlation between neural activation and the causality scores, together with the role of the right anterior temporal lobe in cognitive function, enabled us to interpret the fMRI results and support the validity of our novel methodology. 

Second, the reason we failed to find a significant positive correlation between brain activity and causality scores in any experimental condition should be considered. We believe this was the result of the definition we used for adaptation and the characteristics of our acting task. The definition of adaptiveness, which focused on environmental demands corresponding to an external causal attribution, was taken from Lazarus’ 1984 article [ ]. Furthermore, our acting task was designed to emphasize a frustrating situation corresponding to external causal attributions. Thus, the subjects were likely to process an external causal attribution, derived as a negative correlation between brain activation and the causality scores, more explicitly. Separate studies optimized to highlight internal causal attribution are necessary to address natural adaptive social behaviors. To accomplish this, an alternative definition of adaptiveness, focusing on the processes used to manage environmental and internal demands [ , ], must be developed. Consistent with this definition [ , ], the internal demands were related to real-life adaptive social behaviors, which could be derived as a positive correlation. 

The final issue is gender differences in the adaptive social responses to frustrating situations. Although a previous study reported a gender difference in the response to social stimuli [ ], we did not examine gender differences in adaptive social behaviors. We were only able to recruit eight female subjects for the present study and found no significant differences in this subsample. We assessed the issue of mixed data from all male and female subjects and found that an analysis of the results from the male subjects alone showed the same tendency as did the results for all subjects. Thus, we believe the results are valid despite the small number of female participants. 



## Conclusions 
  
This is the first reported study to investigate the neural correlates of adaptive social behaviors by assessing causal attributions using hypothetical scenarios under experimental conditions. We believe this novel approach has the potential to open up entirely new areas of research using neuroimaging methods. In particular, we believe that the recent development of a visual cortex decoding device using neuroimaging techniques gives neuroimaging studies the potential to provide objective assessment tools for clinical settings.

# Abstract
 
Dopamine has been implicated in the fine-tuning of complex cognitive and motor function and also in the anticipation of future rewards. This dual function of dopamine suggests that dopamine might be involved in the generation of active motivated behavior. The DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor gene (rs1800497) has previously been suggested to affect striatal function with carriers of the less common A1 allele exhibiting reduced striatal D2 receptor density and increased risk for addiction. Here we aimed to investigate the influences of DRD2 TaqIA genotype on the modulation of interference processing by reward and punishment. Forty-six young, healthy volunteers participated in a behavioral experiment, and 32 underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants performed a flanker task with a motivation manipulation (monetary reward, monetary loss, neither, or both). Reaction times (RTs) were shorter in motivated flanker trials, irrespective of congruency. In the fMRI experiment motivation was associated with reduced prefrontal activation during incongruent vs. congruent flanker trials, possibly reflecting increased processing efficiency. DRD2 TaqIA genotype did not affect overall RTs, but interacted with motivation on the congruency-related RT differences, with A1 carriers showing smaller interference effects to reward alone and A2 homozygotes exhibiting a specific interference reduction during combined reward (REW) and punishment trials (PUN). In fMRI, anterior cingulate activity showed a similar pattern of genotype-related modulation. Additionally, A1 carriers showed increased anterior insula activation relative to A2 homozygotes. Our results point to a role for genetic variations of the dopaminergic system in individual differences of cognition-motivation interaction.

## Introduction 
  
The ability to adapt oneself to uncertain, changeable needs of the environment is considered as an outstanding human skill (Collins and Koechlin,  ). These competences comprise the decision making based on exploration, adaptation to found conditions, anticipation of expected results or risks of a given action and a suitable choice from a variety of possible responses to a stimulus (Royall et al.,  ; Gilbert and Burgess,  ; Collins and Koechlin,  ). This complex set of skills is often subsumed under the term   Executive Functions   (EF), a somewhat diffuse umbrella term that attempts to capture the heterogeneity of the psychological processes involved. 

Despite their apparent heterogeneity, the brain processes typically considered as EF can be subdivided into three core functions: inhibition (including the control of interference), working memory, and cognitive flexibility (Miyake et al.,  ; Diamond,  ). These core functions support more complex cognitive functions like planning or problem solving and thus have a broad impact on human behavior and social interactions, affecting quality of life, job success as well as physical and mental health (Diamond,  ). 

Behavioral and neural manifestations of EF can be investigated in an experimental setting using a variety of well-established paradigms. For example, inhibitory processes can be investigated with the flanker task (Eriksen and Eriksen,  ), the Simon task (Simon and Berbaum,  ) or the Stroop task (MacLeod,  ). In addition to inhibitory processes, successful performance of the flanker task also depends upon selective attention (Posner and Petersen,  ; Diamond,  ). Numerous variations of the flanker task exist, but their common feature is that participants are required to focus on a centrally presented target stimulus while ignoring flanking distractor stimuli. The performance of incongruent trials, during which the target stimulus and the flanking stimuli activate different possible reactions (i.e., responding to the central arrow in >>><>>>), is typically contrasted to the performance of congruent trials, during which the target and the distractors jointly activate one single choice of action (i.e., responding to the central arrow in >>>>>>>). Behaviorally, such interference in flanker tasks is characterized by concomitantly occurring slower reaction times (RTs) and higher error rates in incongruent as compared to congruent trials (Botvinick et al.,  ; Casey et al.,  ; Botvinick et al.,  ; Richter et al.,  ; Bugg and Crump,  ). Further research suggests that the flanker task does not only allow the investigation of inhibition performance, but also action monitoring and error detection (Ullsperger and Von Cramon,  ). 

At the level of neural circuits, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is widely considered to be the key neuroanatomical structure mediating EF. The intrinsic organization of the frontal lobes is complex, and a growing body of clinical studies provides evidence for heterogeneous effects of lesions in distinct PFC subregions on different subprocesses of executive functioning (Funahashi,  ; Royall et al.,  ; Elliott,  ). While most neuroimaging research on EF has focused on frontal brain structures like the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the lateral PFC, these structures typically co-activate with parietal cortical regions (Roberts and Hall,  ), reflecting large-scale attention networks that also show increased connectivity during rest (Fox et al.,  ). Moreover, the PFC interacts with subcortical structures, most notably the striatum and the thalamus (Casey et al.,  ; Fan et al.,  ; Posner and Rothbart,  ). 

Because EF, at least to a large extent, mediate goal-directed behavior, it is conceivable that stimuli associated with potential positive or negative reinforcers are likely to undergo preferential processing (Adcock et al.,  ; Boksem et al.,  ; Krebs et al.,  ; Richter et al.,  ), but, when task-irrelevant, also interfere with the task at hand and influence its neural underpinnings (Wiswede et al.,  ; Padmala and Pessoa,  ; Richter et al.,  ). The association of a stimulus with the possibility to obtain a reward or to avoid an aversive outcome typically renders this stimulus highly salient (Boksem et al.,  ). To elucidate how processes of inhibition and error detection are modulated by such salience, the flanker task can be modified by introducing trials in which participants can receive rewards or avoid penalties upon correct performance (Boksem et al.,  ; Engelmann et al.,  ; Hubner and Schlosser,  ). Boksem and colleagues investigated the relationship between punishment/reward sensitivity (assessed with the Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System questionnaires, BIS/BAS) and electrophysiological correlates of error processing in the flanker task, demonstrating that individual differences in reward and punishment sensitivity affected the amplitude of error-related event-related potential (ERP) components in flanker trials that were associated with reward or punishment, respectively (Boksem et al.,  ). 

Additional evidence for a modulation of PFC/dACC-dependent inhibitory control by motivation comes from stop signal and Stroop tasks. Padmala and Pessoa ( ) used the stop signal-paradigm to investigate the neural mechanisms of cognition-motivation interactions during response inhibition. Selective rewarding of correct go-reactions was associated with longer inhibitory RTs in the rewarded relative to the control condition and with reduced PFC activation in rewarded trials. Compatibly, Krebs et al. ( ) observed that reward anticipation exerted beneficial behavioral effects on Stroop task performance, but reward-associated stimuli also impaired the processing of neutral stimuli. 

Converging evidence from patient studies, psychopharmacology and genetic investigations suggests that variability of prefrontal dopaminergic neurotransmission contributes substantially to the widely observed individual differences in PFC-dependent EF (Mattay et al.,  ; Meyer-Lindenberg and Weinberger,  ; Stelzel et al.,  ; Barnes et al.,  ; Tan et al.,  ). Most studies investigating the impact of the dopaminergic system on PFC function have focused on catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), an enzyme primarily involved in cortical, but not striatal dopamine clearance (Tunbridge et al.,  ), but there is increasing evidence for a delicately balanced mutual regulation of prefrontal and striatal dopamine turnover (Meyer-Lindenberg et al.,  ,  ,  ). The dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) is the predominant postsynaptic dopamine receptor in the striatum, but sparsely expressed in the PFC. Presynaptic, autoinhibitory D2 receptors, on the other hand, play an important role in the regulation of dopamine release throughout the brain. Given this dual role of DRD2, it seems plausible that genetically mediated individual differences of DRD2 expression affect both human striatal and prefrontal neural processes. A commonly investigated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linked to the DRD2 gene on chromosome 11q22-23 is the so-called TaqIA polymorphism, which is characterized by a polymorphic restriction site. The TaqIA polymorphism has been repeatedly associated with alterations of striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission. Despite the fact that the underlying molecular mechanisms are yet not fully understood, a number of studies have provided converging evidence for reduced DRD2 expression in homozygous and heterozygous carriers of the less common A1 allele relative to homozygotes of the A2 allele.   Post mortem   investigations and positron emission tomography (PET) suggest that A1 carriers show a 30–40% decrease in DRD2 density compared to A2 homozygotes in the striatum (Thompson et al.,  ; Pohjalainen et al.,  ; Jonsson et al.,  ; Ritchie and Noble,  ). One study employing single photon emission tomography (SPECT) did not find a difference in D2 receptor binding between A1 carriers and A2 homozygotes (Laruelle et al.,  ), but that study was later criticized for the combination of healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia in a sample and for the low resolution of the SPECT method (Ritchie and Noble,  ). Moreover, A1 carriers have been reported to exhibit increased striatal dopamine synthesis (Laakso et al.,  ), possibly reflecting reduced autoinhibitory signaling from presynaptic D2 receptors. In healthy human volunteers, DRD2 TaqIA has been shown to affect neural mechanisms of reward processing, compatible with the high levels of DRD2 expression in the striatum (Lee et al.,  ), and similar effects have been observed for other genetic variations that affect D2 receptor availability (Pecina et al.,  ). In light of the above-mentioned structural and functional connectivity between the PFC and the striatum and the regulation of dopamine release via autoinhibitory presynaptic D2 receptors, it seems plausible that DRD2 TaqIA also modulates PFC-dependent EFs. Indeed, DRD2 TaqIA has been demonstrated to affect task switching and working memory-related processes, the latter in epistatic interaction with COMT Val108/158Met genotype (Stelzel et al.,  ,  ; Garcia-Garcia et al.,  ). 

The reported influences of DRD2 TaqIA on individual differences in prefrontal and striatal function are likely to be particularly pronounced when cognitive processes depend directly on fronto-striatal interactions. In line with this notion, motivation-based probabilistic learning or reversal learning have been shown to be affected by the polymorphism at the levels of both behavior and neural correlates, with A1 carriers being less successful in predicting negative outcomes and showing diminished recruitment of PFC and striatum during negative feedback processing and reversal learning (Klein et al.,  ; Jocham et al.,  ). 

The tasks employed by Klein, Jocham and colleagues depend upon the direct interaction of the PFC and the striatum. Here we aimed to investigate effects of DRD2 TaqIA genotype on the modulation of primarily PFC-dependent inhibitory control and action monitoring by motivational processes, i.e., the anticipation of monetary gain or loss. We employed a modified flanker task during which, in a subset of the trials, participants could receive a reward, or avoid a punishment, or both. Recent evidence from animal studies suggests that the combination of appetitive and aversive reinforcement is associated with more pronounced improvement of learning performance than either one type of reinforcement alone (Ilango et al.,  ). Aiming to generalize this observation to human EFs, we also included a combined reward and loss condition in the task. Participants were genotyped for the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism and grouped into A1 carriers and non-carriers. In a first behavioral experiment, we hypothesized that behavioral responses to incongruent flanker trials would be faster, and possibly more accurate, in reward-associated or punishment-associated flanker trials, and that, in line with their increased risk for reward-related disorders like addiction (Noble,  ; Wang et al.,  ), A1 carriers would show more pronounced motivation-related modulation of the flanker trials. At a neural level, we hypothesized that A1 carriers and non-carriers would exhibit differential activation patterns in brain regions associated with conflict processing like the dACC and structures associated with motivational processing, like the striatum and the insula. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Participants were recruited from a cohort of 615 young (behavioral study: age range 18–30 years, mean 23.65 ± 2.86; fMRI study: age range 19–30 years, mean 23.00 ± 2.51), healthy volunteers of a large-scale behavioral genetic study conducted at the Leibniz-Institute for Neurobiology, Magdeburg. Based on the assumption that a possible small effect of genes may not only require a large number of volunteers but also a strict control of non-genetic factors (Lee et al.,  ), participants were assessed for several exclusion criteria. All participants were right-handed according to self-report, not genetically related, and had obtained at least a university entrance diploma (  Abitur  ). Importantly, all participants had undergone routine clinical interview to exclude present or past neurological or psychiatric illness, alcohol, or drug abuse, use of centrally-acting medication, the presence of psychosis or bipolar disorder in a first-degree relative, and additionally, given the design of the experiment, frequent gambling. For both studies, the behavioral and the fMRI experiment, two participants were invited for piloting of the paradigm. Their data were not used for subsequent analyses. The final study sample consisted of 46 volunteers in the behavioral study and 32 participants in the fMRI study, with no overlap between the experiments. All participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and received financial compensation for participation. The work was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Magdeburg, Faculty of Medicine. 


### Genotyping 
  
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes using the GeneMole® automated system (Mole Genetics AS, Lysaker, Norway) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genotyping was performed using PCR followed by allele-specific restriction analysis using previously described primers (Grandy et al.,  ). Briefly, the DNA fragment on Chr 11q23.1 containing the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism (NCBI accession number: rs1800497) was amplified using the primers DRD2-F: 5′-CCGTCGACGGCTGGCCAAGTTGTCTA-3′ and DRD2-B: 5′-CCGTCGACCCTTCCTGAGTGTCATCA-3′ and standard Taq polymerase (Qiagen and Fermentas). PCR products were digested with   TaqI   (Fermentas), yielding two fragments (130 + 180 bp) for the A2 allele or a single fragment (310 bp) for the A1 allele. DNA fragments were separated on a 2.5% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel and visualized under UV light. Because the COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism (NCBI accession number: rs4680) has previously been linked to individual differences in both PFC function and reward processing (Egan et al.,  ; Schmack et al.,  ; Wimber et al.,  ), participants were also genotyped for rs4680 using PCR and restriction with NlaIII (Schott et al.,  ; Wimber et al.,  ; details available upon request). 


### Behavioral study 
  
#### Paradigm 
  
We employed a modified Eriksen flanker task (Eriksen and Eriksen,  ) with a motivation manipulation (Boksem et al.,  ). Participants were instructed to fixate a central target arrow and to indicate whether it was pointing to the left or to the right by pressing a button with the index or middle finger of the right hand. They had to ignore six distractor arrows with the same (congruent condition), the opposite (incongruent condition) or random (any three left and three right) orientation. Trials were grouped into four types of motivational categories. In reward trials (REW), volunteers were rewarded with 5 ct for fast and correct responses. Conversely, in punishment trials (PUN), they were punished for incorrect, slow or missing responses by the loss of 5 ct. These two conditions were complemented by neutral trials (NEU) in which responses were associated with neither gain nor loss and with trials in which fast and correct responses were rewarded and incorrect, slow or omitted responses were punished (combination trials—COM). Each condition constituted 25% of the trials, and participants were notified about the upcoming trial type before each trial by presentation of neutral, positive, or negative cartoon face (neutral faces, smilies and frownies; see Figure  ). RTs were monitored throughout the course of the experiment. RTs exceeding the current mean RT by more than one standard deviation (SD) were considered too slow, and participants received a feedback (“Faster!”) whenever it was exceeded. Accuracy feedback was not delivered.

As in a number of previous studies, the flanker task was combined with a stop-signal paradigm (Logan et al.,  ; Krämer et al.,  ; Boehler et al.,  ). Infrequently (on 20% of the trials), a circle instead of the target arrow was presented, signaling the participants to suppress their response. We used an adaptive short stop-signal delay (SSD) to yield an approximately equal number of signal-inhibit and signal-respond trials (Krämer et al.,  ; Boehler et al.,  ). The SSD was calculated online separate for each motivation condition. Participants were informed that rewards and punishments would never be delivered in stop trials, regardless of their inhibition performance. An example trial and the overview of the trial timing are displayed in Figure  . 

The experiment consisted of four runs with 144 trials per run (including 24 stop trials). Each run was counterbalanced for experimental conditions and direction of the target arrow. The currently earned amount of money was displayed after each run. Participants were tested alone or in groups of no more than three persons. Before the experiment they were instructed using a standardized written instruction, followed by the opportunity to ask questions. Before the actual experiment, participants performed a training phase consisting of 42 trials (12 stop trials) during which an accuracy feedback was delivered. In this training the starting value of the RT limit was calculated. Data of the training phase were not analyzed further. Participants could earn up to 9 Euros (mean = 5.57 Euros ± 1.53 Euros). 


#### Statistical analysis 
  
To examine the influence of the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism on flanker performance and its modulation by reward and punishment, flanker trials were analyzed with respect to the percentage of incorrect responses and the RTs of correct responses. Correct and incorrect reactions between 200 and 1000 ms after stimulus onset were analyzed. As a measure of interference processing the difference between congruent and incongruent trials (congruency effect) was calculated. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) for repeated measures were calculated for each dependent variable with the motivation condition as within-subject factor and DRD2 TaqIA genotype as between-subject factor. Degrees of freedom were corrected for non-sphericity using the Greenhouse-Geisser correction. 



### Functional MRI experiment 
  
#### Paradigm 
  
The design of the task used in the behavioral study was simplified and adapted for the purposes of fMRI. As the random trials yielded accuracy rates and RTs that lay in between those of the congruent and the incongruent condition, we did not include random trials in the fMRI study, thereby increasing the number of congruent and incongruent trials contributing to the fMRI signal. Furthermore, the potential reward and punishment were increased from 5 to 20 ct, and participants received further 6 Euros to compensate for travel expenses, which they were told after the experiment. The trial timing of the events was the same as in the behavioral study, but the inter-trial interval was increased and jittered between 4 and 8 s, using a near-exponential jitter to optimize the estimation of the trial-specific BOLD responses (Hinrichs et al.,  ). In total, there were four runs with 96 trials each (16 stop trials). The training phase (36 trials including 6 stop trials) was performed outside the MR tomograph. Participants could earn up to 32 Euros (24.42 ± 3.48 Euros; plus 6 Euros). 


#### Image acquisition 
  
Four runs of 390 T2 -weighted echo-planar images (EPIs) per run were acquired on a GE Signa 1.5 T magnetic resonance system (General Electric Medical Systems) in an interleaved acquisition order (23 axial slices, odds first; voxel size = 3.13 mm × 3.13 mm × 4 mm + 1 mm gap;   TR   = 2 s;   TE   = 35 ms). Six EPIs were acquired before each run to allow for magnetic field stabilization and discarded from data analysis. Because proton-density (PD)-weighted MR images possess a good contrast for gray vs. white matter in the striatum and midbrain (D'Ardenne et al.,  ; Schott et al.,  ), a co-planar PD-weighted MR image was acquired and used for improved spatial normalization. 


#### Data processing and analysis 
  
Data analysis was carried out using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, London, UK). EPIs were corrected for acquisition delay and head motion. The co-planar PD-weighted image was coregistered to the mean image obtained from motion correction and used to determine normalization parameters for spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic coordinate system (voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm). Data were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 8 × 8 × 8 mm, and a high-pass filter with a cut-off of 128 s was applied to the data. 

Statistical analysis was performed using a two-stage mixed effects model. At the first stage, the hemodynamic response was modeled by convolving a delta function at stimulus onset with a canonical HRF (Friston et al.,  ). The resulting time courses were downsampled to the temporal resolution of fMRI scanning (1/  TR   = 0.5 Hz) to form covariates of a general linear model (GLM). The model included separate covariates for each condition of interest (correct responses in the conditions NEU-congruent, NEU-incongruent, REW-congruent, REW-incongruent, PUN-congruent, PUN-incongruent, COM-congruent, and COM-incongruent). The model included also covariates of no interest, namely incorrect responses, a feedback regressor, four stop-trial regressors for each motivation condition, the instruction screen, and the six rigid-body movement parameters determined from motion correction, plus a single constant representing the mean over scans. Model estimation was performed using a restricted maximum likelihood fit. 

At the second stage of the model, the conditions of interest separated by genotype were submitted to second level random effect analyses. Specifically, the within-subject factors congruency and motivation were submitted to a full-factorial ANOVA, with genotype as between-subject factor. Because of our strong   a priori   hypotheses regarding brain regions previously implicated in interference processing and motivation, several regions of interest (ROIs) were defined. The ROI of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was generated using the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) of the superior and middle frontal gyrus implemented in the WFU Pickatlas (Wake Forest University), and ROIs of the ACC, the anterior insula and striatum were generated using a previously described literature-based probabilistic approach (Schubert et al.,  ; Zweynert et al.,  ; see Figures  – ). The   a priori   statistical threshold was set to   p   = 0.05 family wise error (FWE)-corrected for all comparisons, with the correction applied to ROI volumes for regions with   a priori   hypotheses, and an additional Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for the number of ROIs (  n   = 8). Coordinates are given in MNI space. To further verify reliability of genetically driven between-group differences and reduce the influence of outliers, confidence intervals were estimated for the local maxima using bootstrap resampling and the percentile-t method (Schott et al.,  ; Wimber et al.,  ). For visualization purposes, activations were superimposed onto the MNI template image provided by MRIcron ( ). 




## Results 
  
### Genotyping 
  
Among the 615 participants in the original cohort who were genotyped for the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism, we identified 22 A1 homozygotes, 210 heterozygotes, and 383 A2 homozygotes. The distribution was at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [χ  = 1.08,   p   = 0.298]. Regarding the COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism, the sample included 164 Met homozygotes, 322 heterozygotes, and 129 Val homozygotes, and HWE was not violated [χ  = 1.57,   p   = 0.210]. 


### Behavioral results 
  
In the behavioral study the data of 46 young, healthy participants were analyzed (27 women, 19 men). The cohort consisted of one A1 homozygote, 23 heterozygotes and 22 A2 homozygotes. Thirty-two participants took part in the fMRI study (19 women, 13 men), including 15 heterozygote A1 carriers and 17 A2 homozygotes. Given the low number of A1 homozygous subjects (  n   = 1), A1 carriers (A1+: A1/A1 and A1/A2) were grouped together for all subsequent analyses. The groups A1+ and A1− (A2/A2) did not differ in gender distribution, mean age or in percentage of smokers. Because the COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism (rs4680) has previously been demonstrated to affect PFC function and reward processing, participants were also genotyped for this SNP, and the distribution of Val and Met alleles did not differ significantly between groups. For detailed demographic information see Table  . Error rates and RTs across the different conditions are displayed in Table  , separated by DRD2 TaqIA genotype.

#### Effects of congruency and motivation 
  
Overall, participants responded fast and accurately. To test for genotype-related and task-related differences in behavioral performance, we computed ANOVAs for repeated measures with congruency and motivation as within-subject factors and genotype as between-subject factor. Replicating previous results (Botvinick et al.,  ; Casey et al.,  ; Botvinick et al.,  ; Richter et al.,  ; Bugg and Crump,  ), we observed a main effect of flanker condition with higher error rates and slower RTs in the incongruent as compared to the congruent condition in both the behavioral [main effect of congruency: RT:   F   = 360.26,   p   < 0.001; error rate:   F   = 66.00;   p   < 0.001] and the fMRI experiment [RT:   F   = 387.10,   p   < 0.001; error rate:   F   = 26.73,   p   < 0.001]. In the behavioral study, error rates and RTs in the random trials lay in between those of the congruent and the incongruent trials, suggesting that the congruency effect depended on the number of distractors (Table  ). Motivational salience (i.e., the presence of reward, punishment, or both) was associated with shorter RTs in all motivated trials compared to the NEU in both the behavioral [main effect of motivation:   F   = 36.18,   p   < 0.001] and the fMRI experiment [  F   = 11.00,   p   < 0.001], while the error rates did not differ significantly across the different motivation conditions (all   p   > 0.074). In the behavioral study, the REW condition elicited the shortest RTs [REW vs. PUN:   t   = −3.98,   p   < 0.001; REW vs. COM:   t   = −4.12,   p   < 0.001; PUN vs. COM:   t   = −0.07,   p   = 0.947]. 


#### Genotype-related modulation of cognition-motivation interaction 
  
Across flanker and motivation conditions there was no genotype-related difference in overall RTs [  Behavioral experiment:   A1 carriers: 410 ± 48 ms, A2/A2: 419 ± 55 ms;   t   = −0.58,   p   = 0.567;   fMRI experiment:   A1 carriers: 438 ± 38 ms, A2/A2: 440 ± 43 ms;   t   = −0.12,   p   = 0.905], suggesting that there were no genotype-related differences in sensorimotor function. 

To specifically test for effects of genotype on interference processing and its modulation by motivational salience, we computed the behavioral congruency effects, i.e., the differences of error rates and RTs between incongruent and congruent trials, separated by motivation conditions. These values were the dependent variables in ANOVAs for repeated measures with motivation condition (NEU vs. REW vs. PUN vs. COM) as within-subject factor with four levels, and DRD2 TaqIA genotype (A1+ vs. A2/A2) as between-subject factor with two levels. The analysis of error rates revealed no significant effects of either factors motivation or genotype (all   p   > 0.120), but in the analysis of congruency-related RT differences, a significant motivation by genotype interaction was observed in the behavioral experiment [  F   = 3.07,   p   = 0.039]. While this interaction effect was not significant in the (smaller) cohort of the fMRI experiment, it remained significant when combining the data of both experiments [  F   = 2.96,   p   = 0.039; because of the differences in experimental design, the experiment—behavioral vs. fMRI—was included as a covariate of no interest in this ANOVA]. To explore the pattern underlying this interaction, we computed   post-hoc   paired   T  -tests on the RT congruency effects in the different motivation conditions, separated by DRD2 TaqIA genotype. Results of the   post-hoc   comparisons are displayed in Table   (both studies combined) and in Table   (both studies separately; note that   post-hoc   comparisons from the fMRI experiment are for illustrative purpose only, given the lack of an interaction effect in the ANOVA). In summary, the results of the   post-hoc   tests, albeit exploratory, suggest that A1 homozygotes showed a reduced congruency effect primarily in the rewarded condition (significant in the behavioral study only, see Table  ) and nominally benefitted from all motivated conditions, whereas A2 homozygotes showed smaller congruency-related RT differences in the combined condition relative to the conditions with reward or punishment alone (Figure  , Tables  ,  ).

The observed pattern suggests that A1 carries showed a small to moderate reduction of the RT difference (incongruent vs. congruent) in all motivated trials, particularly in the reward condition, whereas the RT difference reduction in A2 carriers was largely restricted to the combined condition [genotype by motivation interaction:   F   = 2.96;   p   = 0.039].

### Functional MRI results 
  
All comparisons were based on a full-factorial ANOVA model with congruency (congruent vs. incongruent), motivation (NEU vs. REW vs. PUN vs. COM), and genotype (A1+ vs. A2/A2) as factors. An overview of the relevant comparisons in the regions of interest (dACC, DLPFC, insula, striatum) is displayed in Table  .

#### Effects of congruency and motivation 
  
In line with previous studies (Ridderinkhof et al.,  ; Ullsperger and Von Cramon,  ), a one-tailed   T  -test comparing BOLD responses of incongruent and congruent trials revealed increased activity in distributed regions of the DLPFC and in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; see Figure  , Table  ).

(B)   Neural correlates of motivational salience. Brain regions exhibiting motivation-related activation differences include the striatum, the anterior insula, and the ACC. All activation maps are superimposed on the MNI template brain provided by MRIcron. Contrasts were significant at   p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected. Coordinates are in MNI space. NEU, neutral condition; REW, reward condition; PUN, punishment condition; COM, combined reward and punishment condition. 
  
The effect of motivational salience was tested by means of comparing the three motivated conditions to the neutral condition, using a one-tailed   T  -test. Irrespective of flanker condition and genotype, motivation-associated trials elicited higher BOLD responses in the bilateral striatum (Knutson et al.,  ; Wittmann et al.,  ) as well as in the ACC, the anterior insula, and in the bilateral lingual gyri when compared to neutral flanker (see Figure  , left panel). The anticipation of (avoidable) monetary punishment was associated with a similar pattern of brain activity increases, albeit of lower magnitude (Figure  , middle panel). Activations in the combined reward and punishment trials were largely comparable to those in the rewarded trials (Figure  , right panel). 

A trend for a genotype-independent interaction of congruency and motivation was observed in our ROI of the DLPFC [  x  ,   y  ,   z   = −18, 56, 16;   F   = 8.37;   p   = 0.036, FWE-corrected for ROI volume, but not significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple ROIs] where activation related to the incongruent flanker condition was reduced in the motivated trials relative to NEU (Figure  ). Further localization of the activation maximum using the BA map provided by MRIcron revealed that the cluster was located in the lateral portion of Brodmann area (BA) 10, bordering BA 46.

A genotype-independent interaction of congruency and motivation was observed in the PFC (BA 10, bordering BA 46) where activation related to the incongruent versus congruent flanker condition was reduced in the motivated relative to neutral trials. This interaction effect was significant at   p   < 0.05, small-volume FWE-corrected for ROI volume. Activations are superimposed on the MNI template brain provided by MRIcron. Coordinates are in MNI space. Bar plots depict contrasts of parameter estimates (incongruent-congruent) at the peak coordinate separated by genotypes and motivation conditions.

#### Genotype-related modulation of cognition-motivation interaction 
  
To investigate potential effects of DRD2 TaqIA genotype on the motivational modulation of interference processing, we first computed the   F  -test comparison for the main effect of genotype. Compared to A2 homozygotes, A1 carriers exhibited increased activation of the left anterior insula [main effect of genotype:   x  ,   y  ,   z   = −30, 20, −8;   F   = 17.23;   p   = 0.002, FWE-corrected for ROI volume] (Figure  ). To verify the reliability of the between-group differences, confidence intervals were estimated for the two genotype groups using bootstrap resampling and the percentile-t method (Schott et al.,  ). Between-group differences were reliable as indicated by non-overlapping 95 per cent confidence intervals in three motivated conditions (congruent REW, incongruent PUN, incongruent COM), but the confidence intervals in the neutral conditions were largely overlapping between genotype groups, raising the possibility that the genotype-related differences might be largely driven by the motivated conditions. To further explore this possibility, we performed an exploratory   post-hoc   masking analysis in which the main effect of genotype was inclusively masked with the genotype by motivation interaction contrast (thresholded at   p   < 0.05, uncorrected). The genotype-related activation difference in the left insula remained significant at   p   < 0.05, corrected for ROI volume, in this masking analysis. 
  
 Genotype-dependent modulation of insula activity  . A1 carriers exhibited increased activation of the anterior insula, when compared to A1- in the conditions with potential reward and punishment. This main effect of genotype was significant at   p   < 0.05, small-volume FWE-corrected for ROI volume. Activations are superimposed on the MNI template brain provided by MRIcron. Coordinates are in MNI space. Bar plots depict parameter estimates at the peak coordinate separated by genotypes and motivation conditions. Error bars depict standard errors of the mean. NEU, neutral condition; REW, reward condition; PUN, punishment condition; COM, combined reward and punishment condition. 
  
In addition to the main effect of genotype in the anterior insula, we observed a three-way interaction (congruency × motivation × genotype) in the ACC [  x  ,   y  ,   z   = 9, 38, 28;   F   = 8.44;   p   = 0.006, FWE-corrected for ROI volume; see Figure  , top].   Post-hoc   two-sample   T  -tests over the contrasts of parameter estimates (incongruent vs. congruent) at the peak voxel in the right ACC revealed that A2 homozygotes showed higher activation in the trials with potential reward when compared to A1 carriers [ACC:   t   = −2.87;   p   = 0.007] while A1 carriers as compared to A2 homozygotes exhibited increased activation of the right ACC in the combined reward and punishment condition [  t   = 3.12;   p   = 0.004]. We also observed a trend for a three-way interaction in the right striatum [  x  ,   y  ,   z   = 21, −1, −2;   F   = 6.02;   p   = 0.050, FWE-corrected for ROI volume; see Figure  , bottom], but this did not survive Bonferroni correction for multiple ROIs. 
  
 Interaction of genotype, congruency, and motivation  . Complex genotype-dependent modulation of interference processing was observed in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum. The three-way interaction of congruency × motivation × genotype is displayed, which was significant for the ACC at   p   < 0.05, small-volume FWE-corrected for ROI volumes. Activations are superimposed on the MNI template brain provided by MRIcron. Coordinates are in MNI space. Bar plots depict contrasts of parameter estimates at the peak coordinate separated by genotypes and motivation conditions. NEU, neutral condition; REW, reward condition; PUN, punishment condition; COM, combined reward and punishment condition; INC, incongruent; CON, congruent. 
  

#### Effects of the COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism on flanker-related brain activity 
  
In an exploratory analysis regarding the effects of the well-characterized COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism on neural correlates of the flanker task, we observed a genotype by congruency interaction in the lateral PFC, but outside our   a priori   defined anatomical ROI of the DLPFC [  x  ,   y  ,   z   = 51, 17, 22;   F   = 7.80;   p   < 0.001, uncorrected]. Specifically Val homozygotes showed relatively higher lateral PFC activation in incongruent trials relative to Met carriers. There were, however, no further interaction effects between COMT genotype and motivational salience. 




## Discussion 
  
In the present study, we investigated the influences of the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism on the modulation of interference processing by reward and punishment. Motivational salience, i.e., the possibility to obtain a reward, to avoid a punishment, or both, was associated with shorter RTs in both the incongruent and congruent flanker condition. While the congruency-related RT difference did not differ between motivation conditions, functional MRI revealed a reduced congruency effect in the DLPFC during motivated trials, possibly reflecting increased processing efficiency. Moreover, we observed a complex interaction effect of motivation and genotype on the congruency-related RT differences in the behavioral experiment. This effect was not significant in the behavioral data of the fMRI experiment, but could still be observed when combining both datasets. Nominally, carriers of the less common DRD2 TaqIA A1 allele (A1+) with presumably lower D2 receptor density in striatum showed an, at least trendwise, improvement of interference processing in all motivated conditions (most strongly in the rewarded condition), whereas A2 carriers exhibited pronounced improvement during combined anticipation of reward or punishment as compared to either reward or punishment alone. At a neural level, genotype-related activation differences were observed in the anterior insula where A1 carriers showed increased task-related activation, and in the anterior cingulate, where a complex task by genotype interaction was observed. 

### Effects of motivation on flanker performance and neural correlates 
  
The motivation to obtain a reward or to avoid a loss was associated with shorter RTs in both, congruent and incongruent trials, while error rates did not show a significant modulation by motivational salience. Because of the dichotomous nature of accuracy rates and the considerable individual variability, the power to detect significant within- or between-group differences is limited, and RTs with their continuous distribution might be a more sensitive measure of motivation-related enhancement of cognitive processing, reflecting enhanced vigilance in motivated trials (Hardin et al.,  ). One might argue, however, that shorter RTs, when accompanied by reduced accuracy, might reflect impulsive responding rather than improved performance (Caldu et al.,  ). In the present study, error rates were nominally higher in the reward-related and punishment-related trials, but not in the combined condition. Given the overall low error rates and high variability, it is not possible to determine whether the RT decrease in motivated trials observed here might be to some degree related to impulsive responding. Reward anticipation has been demonstrated to promote responding, but to impair response inhibition in a probabilistic go/no-go task, but no such pattern has been observed for the anticipation of losses (Guitart-Masip et al.,  ). During interference processing in a Stroop task, on the other hand, accuracy was actually improved for rewarded trials (Krebs et al.,  ). Future studies employing more sensitive measures of accuracy are therefore needed to determine whether reward-related reductions of response times during performance of complex tasks reflects actual improvement of performance vs. a speed-accuracy tradeoff. 

Despite the lack of a specific modulation of the RT congruency effect by motivation, at a neural level, we observed a congruency by motivation interaction in the PFC where motivational conditions were associated with reduced activation during processing of incongruent relative to congruent flanker trials. This prefrontal fMRI response reduction is well in line with previous studies suggesting that dopamine modulates processing efficiency in the PFC. Decreased PFC activation accompanied by comparable or even superior behavioral performance has previously been suggested to reflect higher processing efficiency, which has been reported in carriers of the (low-activity) COMT 158Met allele (Egan et al.,  ; Meyer-Lindenberg and Weinberger,  ; Schott et al.,  ; Caldu et al.,  ) and in Parkinson's disease patients who received L-dopa (Mattay et al.,  ). Most studies reporting dopaminergic modulation of processing efficiency focused on the DLPFC. The activation cluster showing a congruency by motivation interaction in our study was located in the lateral portion of BA 10, in close proximity to BA 46. According to a common definition, BA 9 and 46 are referred to as DLPFC (Cieslik et al.,  ), but there is considerable heterogeneity in the literature regarding the precise delineation of the DLPFC, with several authors referring to at least parts of BA 8, 10, and 45 belonging to the DLPFC (Sarazin et al.,  ; Nitschke et al.,  ; Leung and Cai,  ), while others have listed BA 46 as part of the ventrolateral PFC (Arango et al.,  ).   In vivo   segmentation of PFC subregions is also somewhat problematic, since most definitions are based on   post mortem   cytoarchitectonic mapping. The precise localization of the prefrontal cluster showing a congruency by motivation interaction to a subregion within the PFC remains thus somewhat speculative. It should be noted, though that its presumed position at the intersection of the DLPFC and the frontopolar cortex is in line with a previous study demonstrating joint deactivation of BA 10 during working memory and reward processing (Pochon et al.,  ) and with recent evidence for pronounced functional connectivity between the anterior portion of the DLPFC and the dACC (Cieslik et al.,  ). 

Given the lack of a specific behavioral effect of motivation on the RT congruency effect, our results do not allow us to directly infer that the reduced overall RTs in motivated conditions are the result of increased prefrontal processing efficiency. On the other hand, more generally speaking, the co-occurrence of reduced RTs and decreased DLPFC activation to incongruent trials is at least indicative for a relationship between motivational processes, which are known to elicit dopamine release (Koepp et al.,  ; Schott et al.,  ) and PFC-dependent cognitive processing. In line with this notion, an exploratory analysis within the present study suggested that the COMT 158Val allele, which has been linked to lower prefrontal dopamine availability, was associated with increased lateral PFC activation to incongruent flanker trials. 

Several previous studies have investigated the influence of reward and punishment on cognitive tasks, but little is thus far known about their combined effects. Recent animal studies on discrimination learning of frequency-modulated (FM) tones (Ilango et al.,  ) suggest that a combination of both reward and punishment might be associated with particularly strong performance enhancement. In a shuttle box paradigm, Mongolian gerbils were motivated by either appetitive reinforcement (brain stimulation reward) or by aversive reinforcement (avoidance of an electrical footshock), or by a combination of both. Compared to either reinforcement condition alone, the combination of both potentiated speed of acquisition and maximum performance while reducing later extinction. In the study by Ilango and colleagues, reward and punishment were qualitatively distinct (brain stimulation reward vs. foot shock), whereas in our study, the difference between the reward conditions was rather a quantitative one (monetary gain vs. loss). Therefore, the COM condition could to some extent be considered as a reward condition, although it would elicit larger prediction errors than the REW condition. On the other hand, the behavioral pattern observed here speaks against a merely quantitative difference. Namely, while the overall RT reduction across conditions was at least nominally less pronounced in the COM relative to the REW and PUN conditions, the COM condition was the one to show the strongest trend of a motivation-related reduction of the RT congruency effect (for a further interaction with DRD2 genotype, see below). One possible reason for this could be that participants might have slowed down their responses to some extent in the combination condition, in order to maximize accuracy. Indeed, accuracy was nominally higher in the COM condition as compared to the REW and PUN conditions, but these differences were not significant, possibly due to lack of statistical power given the overall high accuracy. Further experiments are needed to clarify whether the combination of both appetitive and aversive reinforcement indeed leads to a shift from speed to accuracy. As a potential limitation, it should also be noted that the size of the cue was larger in the combined condition (Figure  ), which could have distracted the participants from fixation of the target arrow after the cue (  Note:   Pilot data from a recent follow-up experiment with cues of equal size does not support the latter explanation). 


### Genetic variability of D2 receptor availability interacts with motivational modulation of cognitive performance 
  
DRD2 TaqIA genotype did not affect overall processing speed, but the congruency-related RT differences, suggesting that its effects cannot be explained by genotype-related differences in sensorimotor processing. Group-specific analysis of the congruency-related RT differences in each motivation condition revealed that A1 carriers exhibited improved interference processing in motivated, particularly rewarded trials (albeit significantly so only in the behavioral experiment), whereas the A2 homozygotes benefitted primarily from the combined reward and punishment condition. DRD2 TaqIA has been extensively investigated in neuropsychiatric disorders with presumed dopaminergic dysfunction, and the A1 allele has been associated with increased risk for disorders like substance abuse and pathological gambling or obesity, whereas the A2 allele has been implicated in the genetic risk for schizophrenia (Comings et al.,  ; Noble,  ; Dubertret et al.,  ; Klein et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). Moreover, studies in healthy humans have suggested a role of the DRD2 TaqIA A1 variant in approach-related personality traits (Noble et al.,  ; Reuter et al.,  ; Lee et al.,  ; Smillie et al.,  ). While our finding that A1 carriers exhibit a reduction of the congruency-related RT difference in rewarded trials (and nominally in all motivated conditions) is compatible with the notion that A1 carriers might be more sensitive to rewards and losses, the observation that A2 carriers specifically benefitted from the combined condition was unexpected. The A2 allele has been linked to higher D2 receptor expression in the striatum (see, for example, Ritchie and Noble,  ). Studies in transgenic mice have shown that even transient overexpression of D2 receptors in the striatum leads to persistent alterations of PFC-dependent cognitive functions, particularly working memory and cognitive flexibility (Kellendonk et al.,  ), and electrophysiological investigations further suggest that these alterations might be related to reduced inhibitory neurotransmission and lower prefrontal dopamine sensitivity (Li et al.,  ). Because levels of D2 receptor overexpression are higher than the described genotype-related D2 receptor expression differences in humans, inferences from these transgenic animal studies to effects of DRD2 TaqIA genotype effects must be considered tentative. If prefrontal dopamine sensitivity was reduced in A2 homozygotes, this might indeed provide a potential explanation for our behavioral results, namely, while reward or punishment alone might be insufficient to raise prefrontal dopamine availability to a level that allows improved interference processing, the combined condition might be associated with a further increase of prefrontal dopamine that might in turn enable a performance advantage in the A2 homozygotes. In A1 carriers, on the other hand, the congruency-related RT difference was at least nominally larger in the combined condition relative to either reward or punishment alone and not significantly different from the neutral condition. If the combined condition was indeed associated with higher prefrontal dopamine release than either reward or punishment alone, the resulting dopamine levels in A1 carriers might be too high for optimal performance, compatible with the model of an inverse U-shaped function of prefrontal dopamine (Meyer-Lindenberg and Weinberger,  ). 

At a neural level, a complex task by genotype interaction was observed in the dACC (Figure  , top). Compared to A2 homozygotes, A1 carriers exhibited relatively reduced dACC activation to incongruent vs. congruent flanker trials in the REW condition, while this pattern reversed in the COM condition, meaning that both groups exhibited lower dACC activation in the condition in which they showed their most pronounced reduction of the congruency-related RT difference. In the DLPFC, lower activation accompanied by comparable or superior performance has been suggested to reflect higher processing efficiency (Meyer-Lindenberg and Weinberger,  ; see also above), and at least one study suggests that a similar pattern can be observed in the dACC during performance of attention tasks similar to the flanker task (Blasi et al.,  ). One limitation here is the lack of a full replication of the behavioral pattern in the fMRI cohort alone (see Table  ). It should be noted, though that the sample size of the fMRI experiment was smaller than that of the behavioral experiment and therefore possibly underpowered for detection of genotype-related differences in behavior. Brain activity phenotypes have been suggested to be more directly related to the molecular and cellular effects of genetic variations and might thus be more readily detectable in smaller samples (Mier et al.,  ). Therefore, we tentatively suggest that the activation pattern in the dACC might to some extent mirror the behavioral pattern, although caution is warranted. This does, on the other hand, not explain why there was no clear genotype-related ACC activation difference in the PUN condition. One explanation for this observation could be that aversive reinforcement might be more likely to engage other neuromodulatory systems, like the serotonergic system (Daw et al.,  ) in addition to the dopaminergic system, which might reduce the overall influence of genetically mediated differences in dopaminergic neurotransmission during PUN trials. 

In addition to the interaction effect in the dACC, genotype-related differences in neural activity patterns included increased activation of the anterior insula in A1 carriers, and   post-hoc   analyses employing confidence interval estimation and masking further suggested that this genotype-related activation difference was largely attributable to the motivated trials. The insula has been commonly found to co-activate with the striatum during reward prediction errors and reward anticipation (for a review, see Diekhof et al.,  ), although some studies argue that insula-dependent processing of cues and prediction errors is particularly critical for the prediction of losses (Palminteri et al.,  ; Metereau and Dreher,  ) and negative choices (Knutson et al.,  ). Previous studies have demonstrated extensive dopaminergic innervation of the insula (Seamans and Yang,  ), and the insula also shows substantial structural and functional connectivity with the striatum (de Wit et al.,  ; Palminteri et al.,  ; Ye et al.,  ). Expression of D2 receptors, though, is sparse in the insula where the D1 receptor is the predominant dopamine receptor subtype (Hurd et al.,  ). Considering the high levels of D2 receptor expression in the striatum relative to cortical structures, including the insula, it seems somewhat counterintuitive why a genotype-dependent modulation of motivational processing was observed in the insula rather than the striatum where a more complex interaction of task, genotype, and motivation was observed instead. One possible explanation would be that insula activity during motivational processing might be affected by reduced presynaptic D2 autoreceptor density in A1 carriers. In line with this notion, Laakso et al. ( ) observed higher striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in A1 carriers, which they attributed to reduced D2-mediated autoinhibition of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. Moreover, pharmacological stimulation of D2-type receptors by pramipexole during reward anticipation has been shown to elicit increased activation of the ventral striatum during reward anticipation, which is accompanied by increased functional connectivity between the striatum and the insula (Ye et al.,  ). We tentatively suggest that the parallel reduction of postsynaptic D2 receptors and increase release of dopamine from presynaptic sites in A1 carriers might result in increased dopaminergic action outside the striatum, as also proposed by Stelzel et al. ( ), who suggested that adaptively increased dopamine signaling in A1 carriers might evoke a more pronounced gating signal that facilitates PFC-dependent updating processes during task switching. 

It must be seen as a limitation of our study that our results do not allow to make a direct connection between the increased motivation-related insula activity in A1 carriers, which could be observed across motivated conditions, including COM trials, and the complex behavioral pattern in which the different motivation conditions showed non-linear genotype-related differences. Constituting a key structure of the human salience network (Cauda et al.,  ), the anterior insula has been implicated in focal attentional processes as well as in goal-directed behavior (Dosenbach et al.,  ; Nelson et al.,  ), we therefore tentatively suggest that the increased anterior insula activation in the A1 carriers might reflect an increased recruitment of stimulus-responsive attentional resources in the motivated trials, although the relationship between the increased insula activation and the observed behavioral pattern remains, as of now, subject to speculation and needs to be addressed by future studies. 


### Potential molecular mechnanisms underlying the effects of DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIa genotype 
  
Although the TaqIA polymorphism was initially identified during the localization of the DRD2 gene to human chromosome 11q22-23 (Grandy et al.,  ), it has subsequently been pointed out that the SNP is in fact located 10 kb downstream of the DRD2 termination codon on 11q23.1, within coding region of the adjacent ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1) gene (Dubertret et al.,  ; Neville et al.,  ). Subsequent genetic association studies have since suggested that other genetic variations of ANKK1 might also be associated with addiction disorders (for a review see Ponce et al.,  ). As the DRD2 and ANKK1 gene are closely linked (Neville et al.,  ; Ponce et al.,  ), it has been suggested that genetic variations in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with TaqIA might explain the observed relationship between the SNP and alterations of human dopaminergic neurotransmission. Indeed the DRD2/ANKK1-TaqIA polymorphism is in LD with several polymorphisms on the DRD2 gene (Duan et al.,  ; Ritchie and Noble,  ; Fossella et al.,  ). Particularly the C957T polymorphism (rs6277) has received considerable attention as it is in LD with TaqIA and affects stability of the DRD2 mRNA (Duan et al.,  ). However, evidence from   in vivo   D2 receptor binding studies is not conclusive and also in apparent conflict with the   in vitro   data (Hirvonen et al.,  , see also erratum by Hirvonen et al.,  ,  , ). On the other hand, the TaqIA polymorphism, despite being located on the ANKK1 gene, has been repeatedly associated with reduced striatal D2 receptor density in A1 carriers as evident from three   post mortem   studies (Noble et al.,  ; Thompson et al.,  ; Ritchie and Noble,  ) and two out of three conducted   in vivo   binding studies (Pohjalainen et al.,  ; Laruelle et al.,  ; Jonsson et al.,  ). Moreover, the A1 allele has been associated with increased striatal dopamine synthesis, presumably due to reduced expression of presynaptic autoinhibitory D2 receptors, whereas no association was found between C957T and dopamine synthesis capacity (Laakso et al.,  ). In line with these findings, Stelzel et al. ( ) reported a generally increased striatal BOLD signal in A1 carriers. As striatal BOLD signal has been shown to correlate with dopamine release (Schott et al.,  ), this increased striatal activation might be related to higher presynaptic dopaminergic activity in A1 carriers. 

In light of the converging evidence that TaqIA seems to be most reliably associated with lower D2 receptor density further investigations directed at the interaction of DRD2 and ANKK1 is warranted. The predicted ANKK1 protein is an unselective serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase with 11 ankyrin repeats located at the C-terminal end. TaqIA is located in exon 9 of the ANKK1 gene and leads to a glutamate to lysine substitution in the 11th ankyrin repeat. While a direct interaction of DRD2 and ANKK1 has not yet been confirmed, the ontogenetic pattern of ANKK1 expression strongly resembles that of DRD2 and shows upregulation after D2 receptor stimulation by apomorphine (Hoenicka et al.,  ). Strikingly, a genetic variation in close LD with TaqIA, the ANKK1 Ala239Thr polymorphism differentially modulates constitutive and apomorphine-induced ANKK1 expression   in vitro   (Garrido et al.,  ). While D2 receptor-dependent regulation of ANKK1 expression is therefore likely, future research is required to establish whether ANKK1 in turn can also regulate DRD2 expression. 


### Limitations and directions for future research 
  
A key limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size, particularly with respect to the behavioral results that reached significance in the behavioral study alone and in the combined cohort, but not in the fMRI experiment alone. Therefore, relating the behavioral and fMRI data to each directly remains to some extent speculative. Another limitation is that, while our results are generally in line with previous studies that have demonstrated effects of DRD2 TaqIA genotype on motivational processes and EFs, one must consider that genetic variations within the dopaminergic system do not exert their effects in isolation. Regarding the flanker task, a human electrophysiological study could demonstrate relatively general effects of a DRD4 genetic variation on error processing, with a further modulation by COMT genotype specifically during stop-signal errors. While, in the present study, we could replicate previous observations of (inefficient) increased prefrontal activation in Val homozygotes (Meyer-Lindenberg et al.,  ), the sample size did not allow us to systematically investigate the combined effects of COMT and DRD2 genetic variations. Future studies should thus further consider the possibility of both additive (Bertolino et al.,  ) and non-linear (Yacubian et al.,  ) gene-gene interactions within the dopaminergic system on human cognitive and motivational processing. 



## Conclusions 
  
Taken together our results provide further evidence for a modulation of PFC-dependent EFs by motivational salience. Behaviorally, motivation was associated with overall RT reduction across flanker conditions. At a neural level, we observed a motivation-related reduction of DLPFC activation specifically during the incongruent vs. congruent flanker trials, suggesting that motivational salience might result in higher processing efficiency. A genetic variation that has previously been linked to striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability did not affect overall performance as indexed by RTs, but instead, showed a complex interaction with motivation on interference effects. A1 carriers with presumably lower D2 expression showed (at least nominally) improved interference processing during rewarded trials, while A2 homozygotes primarily benefitted from the combination of appetitive and aversive reinforcement. At a neural level, a compatible pattern was observed in a complex genotype by task interaction in the dACC. Additionally, A1 carriers showed an increased neural response of the anterior insula, an effect mostly driven by motivationally salient stimuli. These findings are in line with previous research linking prefrontal dopamine to performance of EFs, possibly following an inverse U-shaped function.

# Abstract
 
Theoretical and empirical accounts suggest that impairments in self-other discrimination processes are likely to promote the expression of hallucinations. Studies using a variety of paradigms involving self-performed actions argue in favor of perspective taking confusion in hallucination-prone subjects. However, our understanding of such processes during adolescence is still at an early stage. The present study thus aims (1) to delineate the neural correlates sustaining mental simulation of actions involving self-performed actions (first-person perspective; 1PP) and other-performed actions (third-person perspective; 3PP) during adolescence (2) to identify atypical activation patterns during 1PP/3PP mental simulation of actions in hallucination-prone adolescents (3) to examine whether differential risk for schizophrenia (clinical vs. genetic) is also associated with differential impairments in the 1PP/3PP mental simulation of actions during adolescence. Twenty-two typically developing controls (Control group; 6 females), 12 hallucination-prone adolescents [auditory hallucination (AH) group; 7 females] and 13 adolescents with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS group; 4 females) were included in the study. During the fMRI task, subjects were presented with a cue (self-other priming cues) indicating to perform the task using either a first person perspective (“you”-1PP) or a third person perspective (“best friend”-3PP) and then they were asked to mentally simulate actions based on the type of cue. Hallucination-proneness was assessed using a self-report questionnaire [Cardiff Anomalous Perception Scale (CAPS)]. Our results indicated that atypical patterns of cerebral activation, particularly in the key areas of self-other distinction, were found in both groups at risk for auditory hallucinations (AHs and 22q11.2DS). More precisely, adolescents in the AH group presented decreased activations in the right middle occipital gyrus BA19, left cingulate gyrus BA31, and right precuneus BA31 for the 3PP > 1PP contrast. Adolescents in the 22q11.2DS group presented decreased activations in the right superior occipital gyrus BA19, left caudate tail and left precuneus BA7 for the 3PP > 1PP contrast. In comparison to the Control group, only the 22q11.2DS adolescents showed a decreased activation for other-related cues (prime other > prime self contrast) in areas of visual imagery, episodic memory and social cognition. This study characterizes the neural correlates of mental imagery for actions during adolescence, and suggests that a differential risk for hallucination-proneness (clinical vs. genetic) is associated to similar patterns of atypical activations in key areas sustaining self-other discrimination processes. These observations may provide relevant information for future research and prevention strategies with regards to hallucination-proneness during adolescence.

## Introduction 
  
Auditory hallucinations (AHs) have been conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental phenomenon (Bentall et al.,  ) with a prevalence varying from 6 to 33% in adolescence (see review Larøi et al.,  ). A number of cognitive processes are thought to sustain the expression of AH, such as attention shift/enhancement, executive and inhibitory deficits, and source monitoring (SM) (Hugdahl,  ; Jones,  ; Badcock and Hugdahl,  ; Waters et al.,  ). The developmental course of these cognitive processes during childhood and adolescence suggests that investigating hallucination-proneness during these key developmental windows may help better understand the onset of early AH. 

SM is a processes associated with the development of AH. Impairments in SM are thought to lead to the misattribution of self-generated mental contents such as thoughts, memories or action to external sources in hallucination-prone adults (Bentall and Slade,  ; Rankin and O'Carroll,  ; Larøi et al.,  ,  ), in adults with schizophrenia (Bentall et al.,  ; Rankin and O'Carroll,  ; Blakemore et al.,  ; Brebion et al.,  ; Brunelin et al.,  ) and in adolescents at high genetic risk for psychosis (22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome; Debbane et al.,  ). 

Most of these studies used a verbal SM paradigm. However Larøi and collaborators used a SM task for actions and found evidence for misattribution of imagined actions in hallucinations-prone adults (Larøi et al.,  ). In this study, subjects were asked to (1) imagine themselves or (2) the experimenter performing an action (3) repeat the action statement without imaging the action or (4) simply observe the experimenter carrying out the action. The results revealed that hallucination-prone subjects more often remembered self-performed imagined actions as being imagined actions performed by the experimenter. 

A subsequent study employed a similar action-monitoring paradigm with adolescents affected by a 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) (Debbane et al.,  ). 22q11.2DS is a neurogenetic disorder with an ultra-high risk for developing schizophrenia (Murphy et al.,  ; Karayiorgou et al.,  ). Transient psychotic experiences are characteristic of more than half of the adolescents with this syndrome (Baker and Skuse,  ). Furthermore, AHs are the most commonly reported symptoms in the sample of 22q11.2DS children and adolescents investigated by our group (Debbane et al.,  ). The assessment of 22q11.2DS adolescents with a SM task adapted from Larøi et al. ( ), showed that adolescents with 22q11.2DS committed more source confusions by recalling imagined-experimenter actions as actions they had mentally repeated (and vice versa), suggesting potential impairments in third person perspective (3PP) taking. 

These two studies (Larøi et al.,  ; Debbane et al.,  ) highlight the impairments in   offline   SM for actions in two populations with hallucination-proneness. Their results might come from disturbances in how information is encoded between first-person perspective (1PP) and 3PP. Theoretical explanations suggest that encoding processes during   online   representation of actions may promote subsequent confusion between self and other by two complementary aspects (1) increased salience of internal representations leading to exaggerated self-focused orientation (Ingram,  ; Ensum and Morrison,  ; Kapur,  ; Perona-Garcelan et al.,  ) (2) impairments in the sense of agency, i.e., the ability to experience oneself as the agent of one's own actions (Gallagher,  ), as evoked by several authors (Schneider,  ; Seal et al.,  ; Jones and Fernyhough,  ; Asai and Tanno,  ). Among the multiple neurocognitive models of the sense of agency (David et al.,  ; Sperduti et al.,  ; Gallagher,  ), Jeannerod and colleagues propose to differentiate between actions overtly executed and those that remain covert, i.e., internally represented (Jeannerod,  ; Georgieff and Jeannerod,  ). Self-other attribution of covert actions might be sustained by the activity of brain areas specifically devoted to self-other representations (Georgieff and Jeannerod,  ; Jeannerod and Pacherie,  ; Jeannerod,  ). 

In order to identify the specific regions involved in the discrimination of self-other action simulation, Ruby and Decety ( ) employed positron emission tomography (PET) to compare the neural correlates of action simulation in a 1PP and a 3PP. Their results showed that both 1PP and 3PP involve overlapping areas of neural processing, in accordance with the shared neural representations theory (Georgieff and Jeannerod,  ; Grezes and Decety,  ; Decety and Chaminade,  ; Decety and Sommerville,  ). However, specific regions were identified in the right inferior parietal, precuneus, posterior cingulate and frontopolar cortices for 3PP, and in the left inferior parietal and somatosensory cortices for 1PP. The authors concluded that the right inferior parietal, precuneus and somatosensory cortices are key areas involved in self/others action discrimination. The inferior parietal lobule is thought to be involved in body image, self-recognition and integration of information coming from sensory modalities and proprioceptive signals (Jeannerod and Pacherie,  ; Torrey,  ). Interestingly, increased activation in the inferior parietal lobule has been observed during conflict between a self-produced action and its consequences (Farrer et al.,  ). The anterior region of the precuneus is related to self-centered imagery and the posterior part to successful episodic memory retrieval (Cavanna and Trimble,  ). According to the authors, the somatosensory cortex could play a role in self-representation (Ruby and Decety,  ,  ,  ). 

Another study focused more specifically on the visuo-spatial aspects of perspective taking during action imagery (Jeannerod and Anquetil,  ). The authors compared brain activity with PET while subjects imagined the same action (reaching and grasping a cylinder) from a 1PP and 3PP. This paradigm revealed increased activation in the parieto-occipital junction (BA19) specifically for the 3PP. The authors conclude that the right BA 19 is a key area for self-other differentiation by evaluating the difference in spatial localization between oneself and an other's perspective. 

In summary key areas of self/other distinction for covert actions are thought to essentially engage the parietal cortex region for multi-modal integration and the parietal-temporal-occipital region, which underpins the shift to another location in space during perspective taking (Ruby and Decety,  ,  ,  ; Vogeley and Fink,  ; Jeannerod,  ; David et al.,  ). 

In order to investigate the neural correlates underlying both self- and other-focused orientation and self-other perspective taking during action imagery, we used a functional magnetic resonance imagery paradigm adapted from Larøi et al. ( ). During this task subjects were first primed with a self-other priming cues (namely “you” or “best friend”) and secondly were asked to mentally simulate actions with either from a first-person (1PP) or a third-person (best friend) perspective (3PP) in accordance with the priming cue. Typically developing adolescents and adolescents clinically prone to hallucinate (AH group) as well as with a 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS group) underwent this task. 

This study has three aims: (1) delineate the neural correlates of action simulation in specific 1PP and 3PP during adolescence (2) identify potential impairments at a neurofunctional level in hallucination-prone adolescents (3) examine whether a differential risk for schizophrenia (clinical vs. genetic) is also associated with differential impairments in the mental simulation of action during adolescence. 

We hypothesized that: (1) typically developing adolescents would activate specific regions devoted to 1PP and 3PP already observed in adult subjects (Ruby and Decety,  ; Jeannerod and Anquetil,  ) (2) the AH group and the 22q11.2DS group would present atypical patterns of brain activation in regions sustaining self-other action simulation, along with confusion in self-other remembered actions. (3) Subjects with 22q11.2DS would present atypical patterns of activation in the parietal cortices due to functional and structural impairments (Simon et al.,  ; Dufour et al.,  ; Bearden et al.,  ; Schaer et al.,  ; Debbane et al.,  ) whereas the AH group would exhibit atypical activations in the prefrontal cortex, as suggested by previous SM studies (Vinogradov et al.,  ; Lagioia et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Eighty adolescents aged from 12 to 20 years participated in the study. Exclusion criteria included age, the presence of any neurological problem or a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Thirty-two subjects were excluded for head movement exceeding 4.7 mm in any of the 6 directions during the scan sessions (Control group:   N   = 9, AH group:   N   = 6, 22q11.2DS group:   N   = 17). In the Control group, we excluded subjects with maladaptive functioning above the clinical cut-off of the Internalizing and Externalizing scales (  t  -score >64) in the Youth Self-Report and Adult Behavior Checklist (Achenbach,  ,  ) (  N   = 1). After excluding these 33 subjects, the 47 remaining youths were distributed in the following three groups: typically developing adolescents (Control group:   N   = 22), adolescents with transient AHs (AH group:   N   = 12) and adolescents with a 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS group:   N   = 13). 

Out of the 22 subjects in the Control group (mean age: 16.00,   SD   = 2.04, 16 males), 6 were recruited within the siblings of 22q11.2DS participants and 16 from the Geneva state school system. 

In the AH group, 12 subjects with subclinical AHs (mean age: 15.97,   SD   = 2.12, 5 males) were recruited through patient associations, by word of mouth or through the Child and Adolescents Outpatient Public Service (Office Médico-Pédagogique). Subjects were selected on the basis of a positive answer (yes or no) on the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale (CAPS) items describing AH items [i.e., items 3, 7, 11, 13, 28, or 32; (Bell et al.,  ; Debbané et al.,  ); see Table  ]. If they answered positively to an item, they were asked to rate their distress, the intrusiveness and the frequency of the experience by circling a number between 1 (not at all) and 5 (very). 
  
 CAPS selected items for auditory hallucinations (Bell et al.,  ; Debbané et al.,  )  . 
  
In the 22q11.2DS group, all adolescents (mean age: 16.14,   SD   = 2.55, 9 males) were recruited through parent associations in France, Belgium and Switzerland. The 22q11.2 deletion was confirmed using DNA polymorphism analysis based on short sequence repeats or by fluorescence in situ hybridization performed on metaphase spreads spanning the deleted region. 

Written informed consent was accepted by all parents and/or subjects under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Geneva University School of Medicine. The three groups (Control, AH and 22q11.2DS) did not significantly differ according to age and gender (  p   > 0.05). At the time of testing, no participants were receiving psychotropic medication (data for this was missing for one subjects in the 22q11.2DS group). All participants underwent the Block Design subtest (Kohs,  ) in order to assess intellectual scores. 


### Design and procedure 
  
Before the scan session, the experimenter described the task to the participants (see Figure  ). The paradigm was adapted from Larøi et al. ( ) and included 60 actions to be mentally simulated (imagined) either from a 1PP or 3PP. Simple, universal and gender-neutral actions were chosen. All actions implied a movement and an object (for example   take a picture, open a bottle, open a window, play the violin, brush your hair  ). 30 actions were tested with a 1PP and 30 with a 3PP, in the same randomized order for each participant. 
  
 Action simulation task adapted from Larøi et al. ( )  . 
  
At the start of each session, the task's instructions appeared on the screen as a reminder. Then, a cross appeared on the screen for 665 ms. Immediately after the self-other priming cue appeared for 1 s stating either “You” written in red or “Best friend” in blue. Then, the photo of an object accompanied by a written instruction specifying the action to be imagined (i.e., play the violin, open a bottle, knock on a door) appeared for 1487 ms. Then the participants were reminded to either “Imagine yourself doing the action” or “Imagine your best friend doing the action” in accordance with the self-other priming cue. This instruction remained on the screen for a total of 4 s. An instruction in the center of the screen asked participants were asked to evaluate the difficulty of imagining the previous action, by pressing 1 (very easy) to 4 (very hard) on a set of buttons on a console. This last step was used to make sure that the subjects performed the task. When a button was pressed, a blank screen appeared followed by the inter-trial interval (ITI) period, which lasted from 2990 to 5990 ms. 


### fMRI data acquisition 
  
A 3T Siemens TIM Trio system was used to acquire anatomical and functional images [  TR   (inter-trial between scan acquisition) = 2400 ms, Echo time (  TE  ) = 30 ms, Slice thickness = 3.20 mm, Flip angle = 85°, FOV 235 mm]. The functional scan session consisted of 380 volumes that comprised 38 slices oriented parallel to the AC-PC lines and collected in a descending sequence. High-resolution three-dimensional anatomical images were also obtained [  TR   (inter-trial between scan acquisition) = 2400 ms,   TE   = 30 ms, Slice thickness = 1.1 mm, Flip angle = 8°, 192 coronal slices, FOV 220 mm]. 


### fMRI data analysis 
  
We used Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) 8, (Welcome Department of Neuroscience, London, UK) to analyse the data. First of all images had to be spatially transformed during the pre-processing step in order to reduce movement effects or shape differences among a series of scans. We realigned every image with respect to the first one. Then, slice timing correction was performed using the middle slice as a reference. We co-registered structural images of each participant to the mean of the realigned functional images. Gray matter separation was established by segmentation of the anatomical image. Thereafter, the normalization produced images that were warped to fit to a standard Template brain. We normalized the realigned and slice-timed images into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template using 3 × 3 × 3 mm isotropic voxels. The images were spatially smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian smoothing Kernel of 6 mm full width half maximum (FWHM) to conform to inter-individual brain size variability. 

After pre-processing, the brain responses of each subject were estimated at every voxel using a general linear mode. We defined two main conditions namely “self” and “other.” The “self” condition corresponds to the trials starting with the word “you” in the priming period and when imagining an action performed by oneself (action stimulation period). The “other” condition refers to the trials starting with the word “best friend” in the priming period and when imagining an action performed by the best friend (action stimulation period). The return to baseline periods were set in the ITIs during which subjects saw a blank screen for 2990 ms to 5990 ms between each trial. In order to compare the specific areas devoted to the two different periods of the task (prime period and action simulation period) voxel value maps of t statistics were obtained for 4 contrasts: (1) prime self > prime other (2) prime other > prime self (3) 1PP > 3PP (4) 3PP > 1PP. These contrasts were performed for the following reasons. First, the prime self > prime other contrast will shield information on the neural correlates related to attention oriented to the self. In relation to our knowledge about overlapping activated brain regions for 1PP and 3PP-taking, some authors have suggested that 3PP requires “additional” areas in contrast to 1PP and vice-versa (Jeannerod,  ,  ; Jeannerod and Pacherie,  ; Jeannerod and Anquetil,  ). As such, it may be that hallucination-prone subjects fail to properly engage these areas, thereby increasing possible confusions between self and other. The two other contrasts (1PP > 3PP, 3PP > 1PP) follow the same logic, but when considering actual action imagery. T-maps were produced to identify atypical activation of the neural correlates sustaining self-other orientation and perspective taking for actions. 

We first performed a one-sample   t  -test to characterize typical activations in control adolescents, and then proceeded to group comparison analyses. Using a two-sample   t  -test (comparison between groups), we compared Control and AH groups, Control and 22q11.2DS groups, and finally 22q11.2DS and AH groups. S{T} maps were obtained with a threshold of   p   < 0.05 and an extend threshold k of 20 voxels. Cluster level peak functional activity at   p   < 0.05 (Family-Wise corrected) was then localized on a mean structural scan with approximate Brodmann areas estimated from the Talairach and Tournoux ( ) atlas after having converted coordinates from MNI to Talairach templates ( ). Age was entered as a covariate in each analysis without any significant effects on the results obtained. 

For   post-hoc   examination of potential associations between hallucination-proneness scores and activations resulting from group comparisons, we planned to extract local brain activity of regions of interest (ROIs) using SPM8 toolbox Marsbar ( ). The ROIs were delimited around the peak of significant activations in prime self > prime other, prime other > prime self, 1PP > 3PP, 3PP > 1PP contrasts for the group comparisons. A 5 mm radius sphere was defined around the center of mass for each subject to extract Beta Values. We performed Pearson correlations between Beta Values obtained for different ROIs and CAPS components for each subjects (AHs distress, intrusiveness, frequency, total scores, as well as subscale scores) (Bell et al.,  ; Debbané et al.,  ).

Differences regarding evaluation results between the three groups and the two different conditions were analysed using a repeated-measures ANOVA 3(groups) × 2(conditions) with   post-hoc   Tukey analyses. 

With regard to the evaluation of difficulty ratings (see Table  ), our 3 × 2 ANOVA yielded a non-significant effect of diagnosis [  F   = 1.875,   p   = 0.165], a significant effect of condition [  F   = 13.315,   p   = 0.001 ] (mean evaluation for self condition = 1.6820,   SD   = 0.40360), (mean evaluation for other condition = 1.8504,   SD   = 0.47230) and a non-significant interaction between diagnosis and conditions [  F   = 0.752,   p   = 0.477].

## Discussion 
  
This study is the first to compare neural correlates in self-other priming cues and action simulation using a 1PP or 3PP in typically developing adolescents (Control group), adolescents with transient AHs (AH group) and adolescents at genetic risk for schizophrenia (22q11.2DS group). The three objectives of this study were (1) to delineate the neural correlates sustaining mental simulation of actions involving 1PP and 3PP during adolescence; (2) to identify potential atypical neural activations during self-other priming and/or action simulation in hallucination-prone adolescents; (3) to examine whether differential risk for hallucination-proneness (clinical vs. genetic) is also associated with differential impairments in self-related cues and in action simulation. Our findings showed that (1) the Control group activated the key areas involved in   other   related cues when primed for their best friend compared to themselves, and in action simulation performed by others; (2) in the 3PP condition both hallucination-prone groups exhibited decreased activation in the parieto-occipital region, which has been related to self-other distinction of imagined actions (Jeannerod and Anquetil,  ); (3) the priming period for both self and other related cues showed decreased activations in subjects with 22q11.2DS compared to those at clinical risk. 

Control group activation patterns during prime and action simulation periods will first be discussed. Then, the unique activations in the AH group and the 22q11.2DS group will be brought into consideration, followed by a discussion concerning the differences between the two hallucination-prone groups. 

### Control group 
  
Typically developing adolescents showed significant increased activations for the “other” condition compared to the “self” condition in both the prime and the action simulation periods. 

For the 3PP, we found increased activations in the PCC and the parieto-occipital regions (see Figure  ). These regions may underlie the influence of visuo-spatial components and episodic memory when adolescents imagine actions performed by their best friend. PCC is involved in the processing of familiar stimuli (Qin and Northoff,  ; Qin et al.,  ), and it has been shown that it plays an important role in memory tasks such as remembering familiar people (Maddock et al.,  ), remembering familiar objects and places (Sugiura et al.,  ) and autobiographical memory (Summerfield et al.,  ; Van Der Meer et al.,  ). The mental simulation of actions may involve the retrieval of memorized visual representations (Farah,  ; Annett,  ) of the imaginary action.

Areas in the parieto-occipital region lobe are activated when processing visuo-spatial information in the context of action representation (Kilintari et al.,  ), object-distance representation (Berryhill and Olson,  ), including position and prediction of moving objects (Maus et al.,  ), coherent moving visual motion (McKeefry et al.,  ; Braddick et al.,  ), and motor imagery of hand action (Willems et al.,  ). The 3PP contrast might engage supplementary areas devoted to motion and visuo-spatial information, as an other's perspective implies a shift in visual-spatial perspective (Vogeley et al.,  ). 

Activations in the frontal lobe could reflect the self-relevance evaluation of the prime period and the motor cognition aspect of action simulation. For the prime other > prime self contrast, we found significant increased activations in the right superior frontal part of the medial prefrontal cortex and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC (Mayka et al.,  ; Northoff et al.,  ; Murray et al.,  ). These results are consistent with recent findings on self-other related processes in healthy adults. According to a recent meta-analysis, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex DMPFC, DLPFC, and PCC act together in the evaluation and decision-making processes of self versus other relevant information (Van Der Meer et al.,  ). 

For the action simulation period, we obtained significant results in the ventral part of the dorsal premotor cortex (Grezes and Decety,  ; Mayka et al.,  ), the left pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) (Mayka et al.,  ) and the DLPFC. These regions could be recruited by the task's motor aspects. It has been shown that the ventral part of the dorsal premotor cortex plays a role in motor preparation (Hoshi and Tanji,  ), the pre-SMA in maintaining an action representation (Stadler et al.,  ) and the DLPFC in the cognitive control of motor behavior (Passingham,  ; Hoshi,  ; Cieslik et al.,  ). 

In summary, our results showed that the mental simulation of actions performed by others engage increased activations in the posterior midline structure including PCC and the parieto-occipital region. Our results may reflect the visuo-spatial and episodic memory components of self-other discrimination for imagined actions. 


### Similarities and differences for the AH group and the 22q11.2DS group compared to control group 
  
Both hallucination-prone groups showed significant decreased activations for the 3PP > 1PP contrast compared to the control group. The AH group and the 22q11.2DS group presented an atypical pattern of activations in the parieto-occipital region with significant decreased activations in the occipital gyrus BA19 and the precuneus. 

As reviewed above, it has been shown that the right superior occipital BA19 is specifically devoted to 3PP in an action imagery task focusing on a visuo-spatial perspective switch (Jeannerod and Anquetil,  ). According to the authors, the mental simulation of actions performed by others first occurs through a shift in space in order to mentally represent the other's place, and is then followed by the action simulation per se. In this framework, BA 19 would be a key area for self-other distinction by evaluating the difference in spatial localization between oneself and someone else. This interpretation is supported by data demonstrating the role of BA19 in the manipulation of spatial relationships between objects (Haxby et al.,  ; Kosslyn et al.,  ) and further confirmed by a meta-analysis (Zacks,  ). Clinical studies have also shown that posterior parietal lesions provoke visuo-spatial dysfunction (Mendez,  ; Harvey and Rossit,  ) or disturbances in the capacity to represent relative location of objects with respect to the subject (Aguirre and D'Esposito,  ). Recent evidence shows that the parieto-occipital junction responds to both gaze- and body-centered representation when reaching a target visually presented (Bernier and Grafton,  ). This could be an argument in favor of a gaze and body reference computed by parieto-occipital junction during shift in 3PP. 

Concerning the 22q11.2DS, Bearden et al. ( ) interestingly detected an decreased cortical thickness in the right parieto-occipital cortex, while to our knowledge, no clear structural alterations have been identified in this region in hallucination-prone subjects (Allen et al.,  ). Moreover, it has been shown that children with 22q11.2DS tend to present significant decreased activation in the parietal and occipital lobe during a visuo-spatial working memory task (Azuma et al.,  ). From a clinical point of view, visuo-spatial impairments have been extensively reported in the syndrome (Wang et al.,  ,  ; Simon et al.,  ; Jacobson et al.,  ). Together, these findings argue in favor of an atypical neuro-development of the parieto-occipital region in 22q11.2DS, which could lead to deficits in visuo-spatial perspective shifting in actions with objects. 

The second region showing decreased activation during 3PP > 1PP contrast for both hallucination-prone groups was located in the right precuneus BA 31 (AH group) and the left precuneus BA7 (22q11.2DS group). In the PET study previously mentioned, Ruby and Decety ( ) found stronger activation bilaterally in the precuneus for 3PP > 1PP, and thus considered the region as specifically involved in distinguishing self and other action imagery. According to their view, the precuneus would play a role in the self's representation with an overactivation during 3PP. The precuneus responds to a wide range of cognitive processes including internal self-representation, episodic memory retrieval, visuo-spatial imagery, 1PP and agency processes (Cavanna and Trimble,  ). The anatomical and connectivity data reviewed by them converges toward a functional subdivision between the anterior (y closer to −60 mm) and posterior (y closer to −70 mm) precuneus (Cavanna and Trimble,  ). Our results for both the AH group and the 22q11.2DS group correspond to a decreased activation in the posterior region. Importantly when considering left and right disparity between the AH and 22q11.2DS groups no evidence of interhemispheric specialization emerged. Whereas the anterior region responds to self-centered mental imagery strategies, the posterior region is involved in successful episodic memory retrieval (Cabeza and Nyberg,  ; Cavanna and Trimble,  ). Episodic memory relies on the ability to remember past experiences (Tulving,  ) with autobiographical references (Tulving,  ) and plays a role in mental imagery (Tulving,  ; Cabeza and Nyberg,  ; Rubin et al.,  ; Daselaar et al.,  ). Clinical data have pointed out to a link between impaired episodic memory and auditory verbal hallucinations (Seal et al.,  ; Badcock et al.,  ; Berenbaum et al.,  ; Daselaar et al.,  ). 

From a structural point of view, a significant volume reduction of the parietal lobe has been described in 22q11.2DS (Schaer et al., 2010). Results from functional connectivity also show atypical connectivity involving the left precuneus and PCC regions during resting state (Debbane et al.,  ). Concerning patients with hallucinations however, no clear alterations of the precuneus have been identified as far as we know (Allen et al.,  ). 

In addition to the BA 19 and posterior parietal similarities, the at-risk groups showed unique differences in comparison to the controls. Compared to the control group decreased activation in the left parieto-occipital junction and the right posterior temporal BA39 was found in the 22q11.2DS group, but not in the AH group. This finding might correspond to a diminished salience for other related cues in 22q11.2DS. As mentioned in the last section, posterior parietal cortex, especially the posterior part of the precuneus, is particularly involved in successful retrieval of episodic memory (Wagner et al.,  ; Cavanna and Trimble,  ; Elman et al.,  ) and in remembering familiar people (Maddock et al.,  ). The right temporo-occipital region (BA39) has been implicated in face processing (Puce et al.,  ; Dichter et al.,  ) and in the increased attention to salient social information because of its interactive processing with emotional information (Norris et al.,  ). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that the right temporo-occipital region presents decreased activation in response to affective social versus affective non-social images in schizophrenia (Bjorkquist and Herbener,  ). Clinical data indicates that the 22q11.2DS syndrome exposes to an increased risk of social withdrawal, poor social functioning and emotion recognition deficits (Baker and Skuse,  ; Debbane et al.,  ; Campbell et al.,  ). 

In summary, our results show that both groups at risk (clinical and genetic) for hallucinations exhibited decreased activation in the parieto-occipital region during 3PP compared to the Control group (see Figures   and  ), which has been related to self-other distinction of imagined actions. We suggest that an impaired shift perspective and/or episodic memory dysfunctions might alter self-other distinction in hallucination-prone subjects. Consequently, the lack of reliable representations of the actions performed by others could account for SM action impairments previously observed by Larøi et al. ( ) and Debbane et al. ( ). Our results also argue in favor of a decreased salience toward others in the 22q11.2DS, as illustrated by the decreased activations in regions sustaining social cognition and episodic memory.

### At-risk groups: differences between the AH group and the 22q11.2DS group 
  
We only obtained results for the prime condition when comparing the AH group and the 22q11.2DS group. This comparison indicated that the salience of self-other priming cues was different between the two groups at-risk for hallucinations, whereas no significant findings emerged for the 1PP and 3PP contrasts. 

Compared to the AH group, adolescents with 22q11.2DS exhibited decreased activations of the caudate body, anterior cingulate BA32 and right superior frontal BA 10 for the prime self > prime other contrast. In line with our results, a significant lower level of activation was found in the caudate nucleus and the anterior cingulate cortex during self-reflective processing in adolescents with 22q11.2DS (Schneider et al.,  ). Several meta-analyses have highlighted the role of the anterior cortical midline structure and especially the anterior cingulate cortex in self-specific stimuli processing (Van Der Meer et al.,  ; Murray et al.,  ; Qin et al.,  ). It has also been shown that the caudate nucleus and the anterior cingulate cortex are engaged in reward and personal relevance, i.e., valuing external and internal stimuli with regard to their meaning for the subject (Enzi et al.,  ). 

Our results might therefore reflect a decreased salience toward self-related cues in the 22q11.2DS compared to the AH group. The differences between the two groups could be related to neuro-structural alterations in the 22q11.2DS. Indeed reduced volume grey matter and cortical thickness have been described in the anterior cingulate cortex (Dufour et al.,  ; Bearden et al.,  ) and several studies have shown an increased volume of the caudate nucleus (Eliez et al.,  ; Kates et al.,  ; Gothelf et al.,  ). However according to several studies these regions are relatively spared in adolescents and adults with schizotypal traits (Spencer et al.,  ; Moorhead et al.,  ; Ettinger et al.,  ). 

Compared to the AH group, adolescents with 22q11.2DS exhibited decreased activations in the right postcentral gyrus BA3 (somatosensory cortex S1) and anterior prefrontal cortex BA10 for prime other > prime self-contrast. The decreased activation of the somatosensory cortex in the 22q11.2DS group for the prime other > prime self contrast is in contradiction with previous work indicating that this region responds specifically to 1PP (Ruby and Decety,  ,  ,  ). In our task however the role of the right somatosensory cortex and the anterior prefrontal cortex BA10 might be related respectively to emotion processing (Adolphs et al.,  ; Pourtois et al.,  ; Hooker et al.,  ; Saxbe et al.,  ) and mental states attribution (Gilbert et al.,  ; Burgess et al.,  ; Benoit et al.,  ). The reduced activations in these regions are in line with clinical evidence showing impairments in cognitive theory of mind tasks in 22q11.2DS (Chow et al.,  ; Campbell et al.,  ; Ho et al.,  ). 

In summary, in comparison to subjects at clinical risk, adolescents with 22q11.2DS showed atypical patterns of activations when primed for themselves and their best friend. More precisely, decreased activations were found in regions involved in self-relevance, emotion processing and attribution. 



## Limitations 
  
The present study must be considered with limitations. First, the restricted sample sizes make it difficult to completely exclude the absence of significant results for the 1PP > 3PP contrasts. Future studies with increased statistical power could address this issue. Concerning the group selection, the 22q11.2DS group had lower IQ scores compared to the Control group. However, the behavioral results showed that response times and difficulty ratings did not significantly differ between groups. This suggests that 22q11.2DS subjects were not put in a more difficult position due to the intellectual deficits they might present. 

The functional imaging paradigm did not include a cognitive control for the prime and action simulation period other than the perspective-taking variants, which could be included in a future version of this paradigm. 

Future studies should address the neurodevelopmental issues of action simulation during adolescence by also comparing children and adults data or data with longitudinal follow-up. More research exploring shift perspective and agency processes may further contribute to a better understanding of action misattribution biases in hallucination-prone subjects. 


## Conclusion 
  
This study constitutes the preliminary step of a neuroscientific examination targeting the neural correlates of self-other discrimination in mental imagery for hallucination-prone adolescents. We suggest that impairment in the capacity to shift perspective and/or episodic memory dysfunction may alter self-other distinction in hallucination-prone subjects. 

### Conflict of interest statement 
  
The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

# Abstract
 
Iterated ripple noise (IRN) is a type of pitch-evoking stimulus that is commonly used in neuroimaging studies of pitch processing. When contrasted with a spectrally matched Gaussian noise, it is known to produce a consistent response in a region of auditory cortex that includes an area antero-lateral to the primary auditory fields (lateral Heschl's gyrus). The IRN-related response has often been attributed to pitch, although recent evidence suggests that it is more likely driven by slowly varying spectro-temporal modulations not related to pitch. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study showed that both pitch-related temporal regularity and slow modulations elicited a significantly greater response than a baseline Gaussian noise in an area that has been pre-defined as pitch-responsive. The region was sensitive to both pitch salience and slow modulation salience. The responses to pitch and spectro-temporal modulations interacted in a saturating manner, suggesting that there may be an overlap in the populations of neurons coding these features. However, the interaction may have been influenced by the fact that the two pitch stimuli used (IRN and unresolved harmonic complexes) differed in terms of pitch salience. Finally, the results support previous findings suggesting that the cortical response to IRN is driven in part by slow modulations, not by pitch.

## Introduction 
  
Pitch is the sensation whose variation is associated with musical melodies. It is arguably the most important perceptual feature of music and is one of the main cues in speech and in sound segregation. There are many different physical features that can elicit the same pitch percept. For example, although a middle C played on the piano sounds very different to a middle C played on the guitar or sung, it is still recognized as the same note. It is this phenomenon that has led auditory scientists to postulate the existence of a “pitch center”—a region of auditory cortex responsible for representing pitch, regardless of the physical attributes from which it arises. It has been assumed that such a region would elicit a greater response to pitch stimuli with stronger pitch salience (the strength of the pitch percept) than it would to stimuli with weaker pitch salience (Griffiths et al.,  ; Krumbholz et al.,  ; Penagos et al.,  ; Hall and Plack,  ; Griffiths,  ). 

Iterated ripple noise (IRN) is a type of pitch-evoking stimulus that is created by generating a sample of noise, imposing a delay, and adding (or subtracting) the delayed version to (or from) the original (Yost,  ). The delay-and-add process introduces temporal regularity, which evokes a pitch percept that is related to the reciprocal of the delay. The more times this delay-and-add process is repeated, the more salient the pitch becomes (Yost,  ). The fact that pitch salience can be increased easily by repeating the iterative process has made IRN a popular choice of stimulus for use in neuroimaging studies searching for a pitch center. These studies worked on the subtractive assumption that deducting the activation produced by spectrally matched Gaussian noise from that produced by IRN leaves a representation of the pitch response. The IRN response that has been attributed to pitch is highly consistent across individual listeners and is also reproducible between studies (Patterson et al.,  ; Krumbholz et al.,  ; Seither-Preisler et al.,  ,  ; Hall et al.,  ,  ; Hertrich et al.,  ; Barrett and Hall,  ; Schönwiesner and Zatorre,  ; Hall and Plack,  ). Most of these studies have revealed an IRN-related response in an auditory region located antero-lateral to primary auditory cortex, in the lateral portion of Heschl's gyrus (HG), but not restricted to this region. When pitch stimuli other than IRN are used, however, the inter-listener consistency decreases and the group-averaged pitch response appears posterior to lateral HG, in planum temporale (Hall and Plack,  ,  ; García et al.,  ; Barker et al.,  ,  ). Hall and Plack ( ) suggested that the reason for this difference is that IRN contains an additional acoustic feature, not present in other pitch-evoking stimuli, that elicits a greater differential response in lateral HG than other pitch stimuli. 

IRN is made from a sample of Gaussian noise, which has rapidly varying envelope fluctuations. However, the iterative delay-and-add process introduces broad spectro-temporal features into the noise (Hall and Plack,  ) (Figure  ). Most previous pitch studies using IRN have not been designed to separate the pitch response from the response to the slowly varying spectro-temporal fluctuations. In order to determine whether it is the pitch, the slowly varying modulations or an interaction between the two that drives the IRN-related response, Barker et al. ( ) created a new type of stimulus. This novel stimulus consists of IRN that has been processed in a way that removes the temporal fine structure responsible for the pitch percept, whilst leaving the slowly varying spectro-temporal features intact. IRN that is processed in this way is called “no-pitch IRN” (IRNo). Results from psychophysical testing indicate that the perceptual discriminability of IRNo modulations improves with increasing number of iterations, in the same way that pitch discrimination thresholds reduce with increasing iterations for IRN (Barker et al.,  ). This is because the depth of the modulations in IRNo increases with increasing iterations. 
  
 Simulated cochlear representations of IRN (top row) and IRNo (bottom row) in the form of spectrograms  . The number of delay and add iterations increases from left to right. The analysis smoothes the representation in both time and frequency domains to remove any fine structure related to pitch. All stimuli were created from the same original sample of Gaussian noise, and the IRNo stimuli on the bottom row are processed versions of the stimuli on the top row (IRN). The color bar shows model output in dB SPL. See Barker et al. ( ) for details of the model. 
  
Since the strengths of the pitch and modulation percepts appear to covary, the results of studies that have examined the neural response to pitch salience, using IRN as the sole pitch-evoking stimulus are potentially confounded by the response to the slowly varying spectro-temporal modulations (Griffiths et al.,  ; Patterson et al.,  ; Krumbholz et al.,  ; Seither-Preisler et al.,  ,  ; Barrett and Hall,  ; Hall et al.,  ; Schönwiesner and Zatorre,  ). In a previous fMRI study, Barker et al. ( ) demonstrated that the response to these modulations contributes to the cortical auditory response that authors of previous IRN studies have interpreted as pitch specificity. In that study, IRN produced significant activation when contrasted with Gaussian noise, but did not produce any significant activation when contrasted with IRNo. Barker et al. also found that the high inter-listener consistency (75% in the left hemisphere and 88% in the right) decreased by 37% (to 38%) in the left hemisphere and by 44% (to 44%) in the right when IRNo was used as a control compared to when the control was a Gaussian noise. 

In the first fMRI study to dissociate the effects of energy onset and pitch onset, García et al. ( ) revealed a non-linear blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response for the addition of one stimulus feature (pitch) to another (energy). The authors suggested that the same neural population was responding to both stimulus features and the sum of the responses reached a maximum saturating limit. If slow-rate modulations and pitch are processed by the same neural population, it is possible that these two features saturate the neural response so that the addition of one feature has little effect on the response to the other. While Barker et al. ( ) found that BOLD responses to IRN and IRNo are broadly similar, suggesting that slow-rate modulations influence the response to IRN, they did not include a stimulus with pitch but without slow modulations, so they were unable to separately manipulate slow modulations and pitch. 

The primary motivation for the current study was to quantify the relation between cortical responses to pitch (in general) and to slow-rate spectro-temporal modulations. The research question was examined within a spherical region-of-interest centered anatomically on an   a priori   estimate of the location of the pitch center based on co-ordinates reported in the published literature. 

The second research question addressed by the current study concerned the effect of pitch and modulation salience on the BOLD response in the pitch-responsive region. Pitch salience was manipulated in two ways: using IRN with different numbers of iterations and using an unresolved harmonic complex with and without a noise masker. Additionally, IRNo stimuli (with a corresponding number of iterations) were used to determine whether activation increases with increasing modulation depth. 

In summary, the main research questions addressed here are:
   
Are the responses to slowly varying spectro-temporal modulations and to pitch co-located? 
  
Are the generators of the pitch and modulation responses sensitive to differing levels of salience for these features? 
  


## Materials and methods 
  
### Listeners 
  
Fourteen listeners (seven males, seven females; age range 22–48 years) with normal hearing (≤20 dB hearing level between 250 Hz and 8 kHz) took part in fMRI testing. All listeners were right-handed (laterality index = 50, Oldfield,  ). Seven listeners were musically trained between grade 2 and grade 7 (# 02, 07, 12, 19, 22, 23, and 25) while three others reported informal musical experience (self-taught/ungraded, # 05, 09, and 13). None had a history of any neurological or hearing impairment. Listeners gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the Medical School Research Ethics Committee, University of Nottingham. The scanning session for one of the listeners (# 25) had to be terminated due to a significant region of unilateral local MR signal decay around auditory cortex, possibly due to a shimming artifact which could not be rectified. Another subject (# 19) had to be excluded from the analysis because the fMRI time series failed the subjective quality control; the amount of head motion exceeded 3 mm and 3° in at least one plane each, hence there was an absence of reliable sound-related activity. 


### Conditions 
  
The experimental design comprised 10 stimulus conditions which part crossed the factors pitch, spectro-temporal modulation, and salience. Two types of pitch-evoking stimuli were employed; IRN and unresolved harmonic complex tones (unres). IRN stimuli comprised three levels of pitch salience (4, 16, and 64 iterations—denoted IRN , IRN , and IRN , respectively), while the unres stimuli had two levels of pitch salience (masked and unmasked unres). Another stimulus contained slowly-varying spectro-temporal fluctuations, but did not evoke a pitch percept (IRNo). This stimulus had three levels of fluctuation salience (4, 16, and 64 iterations—denoted IRNo , IRNo , and IRNo , respectively). The design also included two control conditions. The first was a Gaussian noise (noise) and the second was a Gaussian noise that had been processed in the same way as the IRNo stimuli (processed noise). 


### Stimuli 
  
All of the stimuli were matched in their average spectrum (both in spectral range and spectral density) but differed in whether they had a temporal pitch structure or slow spectro-temporal modulations. All IRN and unres stimuli evoked a pitch corresponding to a 100-Hz tone. For the unres conditions, the fundamental frequency (f0) was 100 Hz. Harmonics were added in cosine phase, and the stimuli were bandpass-filtered between 1 and 2 kHz to remove low-numbered harmonics that are resolved (i.e., separated out) by the peripheral auditory system. As in previous studies (e.g., Hall and Plack,  ) the removal of resolved harmonics was necessary to eliminate tonotopic differences between the pitch stimuli and the control noise, that could have caused differences in activation driven by processes unrelated to pitch. For the unmasked unres condition, the level of each harmonic was 72 dB SPL, chosen so that the gross spectral density (and overall level) of all the stimuli was the same. To make the low-pitch-salience (masked) unres, a bandpass-filtered (1–2 kHz) Gaussian noise masker was added to the unres complex so that the level of the complex tone equaled the level of the masking noise (0 dB signal-to-noise ratio). The level of each harmonic for the masked unres condition was 69 dB SPL, and the spectrum level of the added noise masker was 49 dB SPL, again chosen so that the gross spectral density (and overall level) of all the stimuli was the same. The addition of a noise masker in the spectral region of the unmasked unres reduces the pitch salience. A pilot psychophysical study using nine listeners revealed that f0 discrimination thresholds for masked unres were on average 11% higher than for unmasked unres. 

IRN stimuli were generated by a delay-and-add process performed on a Gaussian noise. A delay of 10 ms was imposed before adding the delayed noise back to the original sample. The delay-and-add process was repeated 4, 16 or 64 times to generate the three IRN conditions, and each stimulus was adjusted to a spectrum level of 52 dB SPL. The IRN was bandpass filtered (1–2 kHz) to remove the resolved harmonics. 

To create IRNo, a conventional IRN stimulus was generated as above. The IRN was sampled using a rectangular window with a 10-ms duration. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) was used to generate the magnitude and phase spectra of the sample, and the phase of the components was randomized. An inverse FFT was then used to regenerate the time representation. The sampling window was advanced by half of the IRN delay (5 ms) and the process repeated. The processed samples were overlapped and added (preserving the start-times of the samples), and adjusted to a spectrum level of 52 dB SPL. The phase randomization process removes any correlation in the fine structure between samples, obliterating the harmonic structure and the pitch cue. However, the slowly varying broad spectral features are preserved. These fluctuations are visible in the spectrogram representation of IRN when it is smoothed in both time and frequency domains to remove any fine structure (Figure  ). The process was repeated using the IRN , IRN , and IRN  conditions to generate the three IRNo conditions. All experimental stimuli included a noise masker, low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and with a spectrum level of 52 dB SPL, to mask cochlear distortion products. 

The noise control had a 52 dB SPL spectrum level and was low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. The processed noise control was generated in the same way as the IRNo, but was otherwise identical to the noise control. The processed noise was perceptually identical to the Gaussian noise but was included to control for any unforeseen effects of processing. All stimuli were matched in bandwidth (0–2 kHz) and spectral density, and hence overall energy (85 dB SPL). Every experimental and control stimulus was gated to produce a time waveform with a 580-ms steady state and 10-ms linear-intensity ramps. 

The energy onset response is an effect that dominates responses in the auditory cortex to repeated bursts of sounds, so that sensitivity to pitch is reduced (Krumbholz et al.,  ; Seither-Preisler et al.,  ; García et al.,  ). To improve sensitivity to the features of interest, we employed a “continuous stimulation” paradigm in which experimental sounds were interspersed by short bursts of noise. In the MR scanner, stimulus conditions each comprised a 15.19-s alternating sequence of 600-ms experimental sounds each separated by 250 ms Gaussian noise (durations included onset and offset ramps) with the same overall spectrum (0–2 kHz) and sound level as the experimental sounds. The 10-ms ramps of the two sounds in each sequence were overlapped at the 3 dB downpoint (at 5 ms); there were 18 presentations of each sound, 19 presentations of each noise and the remaining 5-ms ramps at the beginning and end of the sequence (Figure  ). Sound files of all stimuli have been included as supplementary material.

### fMRI protocol 
  
Scanning was performed on a Philips 3 Tesla Intera Achieva using an 8-channel SENSE receiver head coil. A   T1  -weighted high-resolution (1 mm ) anatomical image (  matrix   size = 256 × 256, 160 sagittal slices,   TR   = 8.2 s,   TE   = 3.6 ms) was collected for each subject. The anatomical scan was used to position the functional scan centrally on HG, and care was taken to include the entire superior temporal gyrus and to exclude the eyes. Functional scanning used a   T  2 -weighted echo-planar sequence with a voxel size of 3 mm  (  matrix   size = 64 × 64, 32 oblique-axial slices,   TE   = 36 ms). Sparse imaging with a   TR   of 8188 ms and a clustered acquisition time of 1990 ms was used (Edmister et al.,  ; Hall et al.,  ). The beginning of every odd-numbered scan triggered the onset of a stimulus condition, with the even-numbered scans occurring midway through the stimulus and a short pause before the start of the next stimulus. A SENSE factor of 2 was applied to reduce image distortions and a SofTone factor of 2 was used to reduce the background scanner noise level by 9 dB. Functional data was acquired over four runs of 98 scans each. Each sound condition had a total of 32 scans, with 34 scans for the silent baseline. Listeners were requested to listen attentively to the sounds, but were not required to perform any task. A custom-built MR compatible system delivered distortion-free sound using high-quality electrostatic headphones (Sennheiser HE60 with high-voltage amplifier HEV70) with passive noise attenuation. An active noise control (ANC) device (Hall et al.,  ) was used to reduce the overall acoustical scanner noise by a further 14 dB. Eight scans were appended to the beginning of the run in order to initialize the noise cancelling device. These scans were excluded from the analysis. 


### Data analysis 
  
Images were analyzed separately for each listener using statistical parametric mapping (SPM5,  ). Preprocessing steps included realignment to correct for subject motion, normalization of individual scans to a standard image template, and smoothing with a Gaussian filter of 8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). The realignment process generated estimates of the scan-to-scan movement for three translations (x, y, and z planes) and three rotations (roll, pitch, and yaw). These were included as variables in the individual design specification in addition to the 10 sound conditions and the four scanning runs. The silent baseline was implicitly modeled in the design. The first-level general linear model assessed the variables of interest with respect to the scan-to-scan variability. A high-pass filter cutoff of 420 s was used to remove low frequency confounds. The resulting model estimated the fit of the design matrix (X) to the data (Y) in each voxel in order to provide β-values (the contribution of a single regressor to the overall fMRI signal). Separate statistical contrasts for each sound condition were specified relative to the silent baseline. To investigate the differential responses across conditions, a One-Way ANOVA was specified at the second level with all 10 sound contrasts, using the preceding contrast images for each individual as input. We defined the model in this way because it provides maximum flexibility for assessing the different effects of interest. Different combinations of contrast weights were then specified from the variables in the ANOVA to determine differences between factors. Contrast weights for each of the stimulus conditions of interest (pitch and slow modulation) were defined to provide a factorial model where two stimulus conditions contributed to each cell in the matrix. The design is represented schematically in Figure  . It is important to note that the pitch salience of the IRN is not matched to the salience of the unres and so the design is not fully factorial.

Although 14 listeners were scanned, only 12 were included in the analyses (reasons for excluding subjects 19 and 25 were mentioned in the Listeners section above). To improve external validity, our interpretation of the pitch- and modulation-related activity was informed by a spherical region of interest (ROI) with a radius = 10 mm. This ROI was centered on the average peak co-ordinates that had been derived from four previous pitch studies (Table  ) with coordinates   x  -58   y  -24   z  -7 in the left hemisphere and   x  -63   y  -17   z  -5 in the right. All studies included in the average used normal-hearing participants with no history of neurological disease. Studies using IRN were excluded because of the potential confound with the response to slow modulation and only those studies reporting Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates for non-IRN pitch responses could be included. Pitch-related activation within this spherical ROI was interpreted to represent a highly consistent pitch response across studies. This spherical ROI encompassed parts of central and lateral HG and PT. Localization was made with reference to a software toolbox in SPM5 that estimates the cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of HG and assigns probability values estimating the likelihood that a voxel occurs within a particular auditory field (Morosan et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). According to this particular anatomical scheme, medial HG is called Te 1.1, central HG is called Te 1.0, and lateral HG is called Te 1.2.

Examining the main effect of slow modulation and the interaction between slow modulation and pitch were also restricted to the same spherical region in order to ascertain whether any such effects might be present within the pitch-responsive region. All significant results have been controlled for type I errors by employing a volume correction based on the number of independent voxel elements within the spherical ROI. This correction used a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of   p   < 0.05 (Genovese et al.,  ). 



## Results 
  
### Sensitivity to pitch and to slow modulation 
  
To determine whether the responses to pitch and to slow modulation are co-located to the same voxels within the pitch-related ROI, the response to pitch was measured by comparing the four most salient pitch conditions (masked unres, unmasked unres, IRN , IRN ) to the four matched no-pitch conditions (noise, processed noise, IRNo  and IRNo ) (Figure  ). Within the spherical ROI, this contrast highlighted bilateral peaks of pitch-related activity with maxima in posterior auditory cortex (PT) (  x  -64   y  -28   z  -6 in the left hemisphere and   x  -64   y  -22   z  -10 in the right, Table  ). The cluster in the left hemisphere contained two further maxima. Probability estimates placed both peaks in central HG, although one was potentially within lateral HG. The right hemisphere cluster contained one further maximum. This peak was most likely in PT, although again lateral HG could not be ruled out.

These images used an uncorrected threshold   p   < 0.05.

The main effect of slow modulation was determined by contrasting IRNo , IRNo , IRN , and IRN  with noise, processed noise, masked and unmasked unres (Figure  ). This contrast did not reveal any clusters of activity that survived correction for multiple comparisons (FDR   p   > 0.05). 

Although the random effects analysis did not suggest a significant effect of slow modulation, this voxel-by-voxel analysis approach is rather conservative. For example, statistical significance is dependent upon the response being present in the same voxel location across listeners. To allow for some degree of spatial variability, we conducted a region-based analysis averaging each condition-specific response (i.e., mean β-values) across all voxels within the spherical ROI, separately for each listener. Data extraction for the region-based analysis used the approach described by Hall and Plack ( ). To determine the effects of pitch and modulation and the nature of any interaction between these two factors within the spherical ROI, values were averaged for the two conditions in each cell of the 2 × 2 ANOVA depicted in Figure  . The region-based analysis revealed significant effects of both pitch [  F   = 24.30,   p   < 0.05] and slow modulation [  F   = 24.19,   p   < 0.05], with a significant interaction between pitch and slow modulation [  F   = 24.55,   p   < 0.05]. The nature of the interaction was such that both of the stimuli that contained slowly varying modulation (IRN and IRNo) and the unresolved harmonic complex elicited a similar response, whereas the stimulus that contained neither pitch nor slow modulation (noise) elicited a lesser response (Figure  ). The relation between the responses to pitch and slow modulation in the pitch-responsive region is   saturating  : the effects of the two features are not linearly additive. However, it is possible that this interaction was influenced by the weaker pitch salience of IRN compared to the unresolved complex tones (see Section Salience-Related Activity). Although there is no evidence that the responses to pitch and to slow modulation are co-located at the voxel level, it is apparent from the spherical ROI analysis that there is an overall effect of both pitch and slow modulation within that region.

The same analysis performed in medial HG (Te 1.1) also revealed a significant effect of pitch [  F   = 2.76,   p   < 0.05], of slow modulation [  F   = 2.29,   p   < 0.05] and a significant interaction between pitch and modulation [  F   = 34.23,   p   < 0.05]. However, the effects of pitch, and the interaction between pitch and modulation, were smaller in Te 1.1 than in the pitch-related ROI (Figure  ). Combining the results, there was a significant two-way interaction between pitch and region (pitch-related ROI and Te 1.1) [  F   = 29.92,   p   < 0.05], and a significant three-way interaction between pitch, modulation, and region [  F   = 13.63,   p   < 0.05]. Hence, there is evidence for some regional specificity in the pitch response, and that the response in the pitch-related ROI is not just a generic response to acoustic change. 

In order to determine whether IRN-related activity is driven by slowly varying spectro-temporal modulation or by pitch, a 2 × 3 repeated-measures ANOVA was performed within the original spherical ROI for the IRN and IRNo conditions with stimulus (IRN and IRNo) and salience (4, 16, and 64 iterations) as factors. This ANOVA did not reveal a significant effect of stimulus [  F   = 0.981,   p   > 0.05], but there was a significant effect of salience (number of iterations) [  F   = 9.070,   p   < 0.05 (Greenhouse-Geisser corrected)] with no significant interaction between stimulus and salience [  F   = 2.749,   p   > 0.05]. This pattern of results is consistent with our previous interpretation that the spectro-temporal modulations, not the pitch, drive the IRN-related response (Barker et al.,  ). 


### Salience-related activity 
  
The final analyses addressed the second research question: Are the generators of the pitch and modulation responses sensitive to differing levels of salience for these features? A pilot exploration using eight listeners demonstrated that pitch discrimination thresholds for high-salience IRN stimuli were considerably higher than for the low-salience unres stimuli (mean geometric threshold for IRN  and masked unres were 96.9 and 26.4 Hz, respectively [  T   = 4.41,   p   < 0.05]). This finding implies that IRN stimuli elicited a weaker pitch percept than unres stimuli and that the factorial design is not balanced for pitch salience, so these pitch comparisons were analyzed separately. Since the research question relates to an effect of salience   within a pitch-responsive region  , the spherical ROI described previously was applied. For unres stimuli, the subtraction (unmasked unres—masked unres) examined the effect of pitch salience. Within the spherical ROI, this contrast highlighted bilateral clusters in auditory cortex, with peaks located in PT (  x  -58   y  -30   z  -8 in the left hemisphere and   x  -60   y  -22   z  -6 in the right). The left cluster contained four maxima, of which one was potentially located within lateral HG (  x  -56   y  -18   z  -10). The cluster in the right hemisphere contained three maxima including one that incorporated part of lateral HG (  x  -62   y  -6   z  -4). To investigate the effect of pitch salience for the IRN stimuli, the subtraction (IRN —IRN ) was performed and the results were displayed using an “exclusive mask” for the subtraction (IRNo —IRNo ) which means that any voxels showing a differential response to the depth of the spectro-temporal modulations were excluded. There were no maxima for salience-related activity for IRN that remained significant when corrected for multiple comparisons (FDR,   p   > 0.05). 

In order to determine whether the pitch region as a whole was sensitive to pitch salience, the region-based analysis described in 3.1 was performed separately for IRN and for unres. For the IRN stimuli, IRN  and IRN  were contrasted, with values for IRNo  and IRNo , respectively, subtracted to control for the effects of slow-rate modulation. This analysis revealed a significant effect of salience [  F   = 7.84,   p   < 0.05] within the spherical ROI (Figure  ). For unres stimuli, masked and unmasked unres were contrasted. Unsurprisingly (based on the results reported above), this analysis also revealed a significant effect of salience [  F   = 63.02,   p   < 0.05] (Figure  ). It is apparent from Figure   that the low-salience unres produced greater activation than the high-salience IRN [  F   = 33.92,   p   < 0.05], which is consistent with results from the psychophysical testing and could explain why there were no significant salience-related voxels for IRN. 
  
 Plot of the salience analysis results for IRN and for unres within the spherical pitch ROI  . “Activation” refers to the average beta weights: a numerical measure of the effect size. The low salience conditions are represented by the light gray bars and the high salience conditions are represented by the dark gray bars. For the low-salience IRN condition, IRNo  has been subtracted from IRN  and for the high-salience condition, IRNo  has been subtracted from IRN  to remove the effects of slow modulation. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. 
  
To investigate the effect of modulation salience, the subtraction (IRNo  - IRNo ) was performed. This contrast did not reveal any supra-threshold clusters (FDR,   p   > 0.05). However, results from the ROI analysis suggest a significantly greater average response to IRNo  than to IRNo  within the spherical ROI [  F   = 5.08,   p   < 0.05]. Hence, when the average BOLD response is taken across all voxels within the pitch-responsive region defined in this study, the region demonstrates sensitivity to both pitch salience and salience of slow-rate modulations. 



## Discussion 
  
### Responses to pitch and slow modulation 
  
A previous study (Barker et al.,  ) revealed that the slowly varying spectro-temporal modulations created by the delay-and-add iterative process influence the IRN response, but the results could not determine the precise nature of this influence. It is possible that, due to non-linearities in the neural response (Sidtis et al.,  ; Friston et al.,  ; Devor et al.,  ) there is a saturating interaction between the responses to pitch and to slow modulation whereby the BOLD response is dominated by one feature (e.g., spectro-temporal modulation) so that the response to any additional feature (e.g., pitch) is limited by the saturation of the BOLD signal. In a meta analysis focusing on the role of PT (Griffiths and Warren,  ), the effects of both pitch (tone vs. noise contrast) and modulation (frequency-modulated vs. unmodulated tone contrast) fell within the spherical ROI used in the current study. It is therefore plausible that either the same populations of neurons are responsible for processing both features, or that there are dispersed feature-specific neurons for pitch and for slow modulation that occupy the same region of auditory cortex. Our ROI analysis constrained our hypothesis to a circumscribed focal brain region, and so we cannot rule out this latter alternative explanation. 

The present results revealed a saturating interaction between the responses to pitch and to slow-modulation. This could reflect a saturation in the neural response due to co-location of the representation of the two features. However, a psychophysical pilot experiment revealed that IRN stimuli elicited a much weaker pitch percept than unres stimuli, even when the unres stimuli were masked to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio. With that in mind, it is possible that the pitch percept elicited by IRN was not strong enough to increase the BOLD signal significantly above that of the IRNo stimuli. In other words, we cannot rule out the possibility that the saturating interaction was due to the differing salience of the pitch-evoking stimuli, rather than a saturation in the neural response. 


### The IRN response may be driven in part by slow modulations 
  
Due to the lack of a significant difference between the responses to IRN and IRNo discussed above, it is not clear whether the response to IRN is driven mainly by slowly varying modulations or by pitch. This is consistent with the finding of Barker et al. ( ), who reported broadly similar response patterns for IRN and for IRNo within central and lateral HG and within PT. However, both studies indicated a small additional effect of the pitch in IRN over and above the modulation response elicited by IRNo. In the current study, there were significant clusters of activation for the high vs. low salience IRN contrast at an uncorrected level but not for the equivalent IRNo contrast. In the Barker et al. ( ) study, there was a significant linear trend for number of iterations for IRN, but not for IRNo. Furthermore, the contrast (IRN - IRNo) in that study revealed a bilateral pitch-related response for IRN that was co-located for up to seven of their 16 listeners. Therefore, although it appears that slow modulation accounts for the majority of the IRN response magnitude, there is some evidence that pitch does contribute in a small way. 


### The pitch-responsive region is sensitive to pitch salience and to modulation salience 
  
Some previous research has suggested a sensitivity to pitch salience in auditory cortex (Griffiths et al.,  ; Penagos et al.,  ; Bendor and Wang,  ; Gutschalk et al.,  ), although this finding is not universal. For example, using pulse trains with different amounts of jitter, and unresolved harmonic complexes with different relative phases, Barker et al. ( ) actually found a   decrease   in activation with increasing pitch salience. The pitch-evoking stimuli used here contained only unresolved harmonics and as such, they elicit a less salient pitch percept than stimuli containing resolved harmonics (Houtsma and Smurzynski,  ). However, the unresolved stimuli were sufficiently salient to investigate the relative salience between the different conditions. Results from the current experiment provide evidence for a general sensitivity to pitch salience within the pitch-responsive region, with specific foci that exhibit a strong salience-related response for salient pitch stimuli. As previously mentioned, the pitch of the high-salience IRN condition was not as strong as the pitch of the low-salience unres condition. Hence, it is possible that the high-salience IRN condition was not sufficiently salient to produce an increase in the magnitude of the BOLD response that was large enough to survive correction in the salience-responsive foci for IRN. Indeed, Figure   provides support for this conjecture. However, results from the ROI analysis suggest a general sensitivity to differences in salience even for stimuli that evoke a weak pitch percept. 

To summarize, the results of the salience analyses suggest that the cortical representation of pitch is sensitive to differing levels of pitch salience. The analysis also provides evidence that the cortical response is sensitive to differing depths of slow modulation, which suggests that slow modulation may affect the salience response for IRN. 


### Implications for the location of the “pitch center” 
  
To minimize the effects of onset energy, we chose to use a paradigm in which noise was interleaved between stimuli. As a result of this design choice, all of the conditions except the Gaussian noise condition had perceptible acoustic changes from stimulus to stimulus, and thus the observed response pattern could possibly be driven, at least in part, by a generic response to presence of acoustic changes, rather than to the presence of modulation or pitch   per se  . However, the ROI studied here has been identified by several studies as being selective for pitch using a pulsed paradigm (without interleaved noise) (Hall and Plack,  ; Barker et al.,  ; Puschmann et al.,  ; García et al.,  ). There is external evidence, therefore, that the ROI is not a region that responds non-specifically to any stimulus change. In addition, in the present study pitch-related activation was greater in the spherical ROI than in Te 1.1, suggesting a specificity for pitch processing in the spherical ROI. 

Evidence from MEG and fMRI studies also suggests that the present results probably reflect a specific response to the effects of interest (pitch and slow modulation) rather than to non-specific response to   any   change in stimulus feature. For example, using IRN as their pitch stimulus, Krumbholz et al. ( ) reported a significant magnetic deflection for the change from noise to pitch with no corresponding deflection for the change from pitch to noise. Chait et al. ( ) found distinct temporal and spatial differences between the change from noise to pitch (Huggins pitch and pure tone in noise) and the change from decorrelated to correlated noise. Dipole source modeling locates the responses from both MEG studies in lateral HG, although the spatial resolution is not accurate enough to rule out the possibility that their responses could have been located in PT or across the two regions. Finally, in an fMRI study using Huggins pitch and an unresolved harmonic complex as their stimuli, García et al. ( ) reported a significant difference between their pitch-in-noise vs. constant noise contrast and their noise-in-silence vs. constant noise contrast in the region of PT. However, even if the pitch-sensitive region examined in the present experiment does not respond to all stimulus features, it clearly responds strongly to slow modulations, and the response to these features interacts with the response to pitch. This raises doubts regarding whether the “pitch center” is exclusive for pitch processing. 

Within the spherical ROI, it is conjectured that the precise location of pitch-sensitive responses had some spatial variability across individual listeners. Our evidence here is based on the fact that there was no significant voxel-by-voxel response, possibly due to the lack of a voxel-level overlap. 



## Summary 
  
The pre-defined pitch-responsive region was found to contain representations for both pitch and slow modulation. There was also a response to pitch salience and to modulation salience in this region. The results support the suggestion made by Barker et al. ( ) that the slowly varying spectro-temporal modulations in IRN affect the response. This finding implies that future studies using IRN as a pitch-evoking stimulus should employ a baseline that controls for these modulations (such as IRNo) and that interpretations from results of previous studies using IRN as their sole pitch-evoking stimulus should be carefully reconsidered. 

### Conflict of interest statement

# Abstract
 
Binge drinking is now considered a central public health issue and is associated with emotional and interpersonal problems, but the neural implications of these deficits remain unexplored. The present study aimed at offering the first insights into the effects of binge drinking on the neural processing of vocal affect. On the basis of an alcohol-consumption screening phase (204 students), 24 young adults (12 binge drinkers and 12 matched controls, mean age: 23.8 years) were selected and performed an emotional categorisation task on morphed vocal stimuli (drawn from a morphed fear–anger continuum) during fMRI scanning. In comparison to controls, binge drinkers presented (1) worse behavioural performance in emotional affect categorisation; (2) reduced activation of bilateral superior temporal gyrus; and (3) increased activation of right middle frontal gyrus. These results constitute the first evidence of altered cerebral processing of emotional stimuli in binge drinking and confirm that binge drinking leads to marked cerebral changes, which has important implications for research and clinical practice. 
   Highlights  
  
Binge drinking is associated with impaired emotional auditory processing. 
  
Binge drinkers show reduced superior temporal gyri activity during voice processing. 
  
This deficit is compensated by increased activity in right middle frontal gyrus. 
  
These brain alterations are parallel to those described in alcohol-dependence.

## Introduction 
  
Binge drinking refers to repeated alternation between massive alcohol intakes and abstinence periods, and is becoming increasingly prominent among young adults ( ). Its deleterious consequences have been described at medical, cognitive and social levels ( ), but the influence of binge drinking on brain functioning has received only limited attention. However, as it is largely established that long-term excessive alcohol consumption leads to marked cerebral impairments ( ) and as binge drinking might constitute a first step towards alcohol-dependence ( ), young binge drinkers may already present cerebral changes. This proposal is further reinforced by two arguments: First, binge drinking is characterized by repeated alternations between intense alcohol consumption and withdrawal periods which are harmful for brain functioning ( ). Second, the adolescent brain is in an intense neuronal remodelling phase and is thus highly sensitive to the effects of alcohol ( ). 

Nevertheless, very few functional neuroimaging studies have explored the cerebral consequences of binge drinking habits in humans. Several studies have investigated the cerebral effects of alcohol-dependence in young individuals ( ) or the anatomical consequences of binge drinking ( ) but without exploring the related functional changes. Moreover, electrophysiological studies suggested altered brain functioning in binge drinking but without precisely identifying the brain regions involved ( ). Actually, only five studies have specifically explored the functional correlates of binge drinking using fMRI ( ). These studies showed that binge drinking in adolescence is associated with decreased activity in occipital, hippocampal and prefrontal areas, but with increased activity in amygdala, insula, parietal and superior frontal regions during memory and decision making tasks. While contributing to a better understanding of cerebral changes in binge drinking, these preliminary studies have not answered several crucial questions:   
It is unclear whether the cerebral changes observed are specific to the high-level tasks used earlier or would also be observed when other cognitive abilities are required. Specifically, as large-scale emotional impairments have been shown in alcohol-dependence ( ) and as affective deficits have been suggested in binge drinking ( ), the brain deficits may also be present during the processing of emotions. 
  
Most of these studies focused on adolescent binge drinkers, but this habit is far more frequent among young adults ( ) and the generalisation of earlier results to the global binge drinking population remains unknown. As brain remodelling is more limited among young adults, binge drinking might indeed have less cerebral effects in this population. 
  
Binge drinkers with current marijuana use ( ) or other drug abuse ( ) have been included in previous studies, and subclinical comorbidities have not always been controlled for, leading to group differences in depression and anxiety ( ). Given that marijuana, subclinical depression and anxiety affect brain activity ( ), the cerebral changes reported might partly be due to these comorbidities. 
  

Here, we used an auditory affective two-alternative forced choice task among young adult binge drinkers without comorbidities and additional drug abuse to avoid the aforementioned shortcomings. Our main hypothesis is that the functional brain changes due to binge drinking, thus far observed during cognitive tasks, are also present in emotional tasks. We specifically hypothesized a reduced performance during auditory emotional processing in binge drinking, associated with a reduced activation of the brain regions classically involved in the processing of vocally expressed emotions. Specifically, earlier studies conducted among healthy participants have shown that the processing of human affective bursts and prosody mainly relies not only on superior temporal gyri ( ), but also on the right middle temporal gyrus ( ) and inferior frontal gyri ( ). Moreover, as our population consisted of young adults without psychopathological comorbidities, the present study will also test whether the deficit observed in previous studies on adolescent binge drinkers can be generalised to the core population of binge drinkers, and whether this deficit persists when comorbidities are controlled for. 


## Material and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
A general screening phase was first conducted among the under- and postgraduate community of the University of Glasgow (United Kingdom). 204 students filled in a questionnaire assessing psychological measures and alcohol-drug consumption characteristics. On the basis of this evaluation, 24 students were selected, fulfilling the following conditions: no positive personal or family history of alcohol-dependence, absence of past or current other drug or psychotropic medication consumption, absence of present nicotine dependence, no major medical problems, no central nervous system disorder (including epilepsy and history of brain trauma), no auditory impairment, low depression (i.e. score lower than 8 at the Beck Depression Inventory, BDI ( )) and anxiety scores (i.e. scores lower than 45 and 52 at the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI A–B ( ), respectively), and right-handedness. 

Three variables were used to determine the groups: mean number of alcohol doses per drinking occasion (i.e. per day during which alcoholic drinks are consumed), mean number of drinking occasions per week and consumption speed in doses per hour. One dose corresponds to 10 g of pure ethanol. According to their alcohol consumption during the last six months, subjects were distributed among two groups of 12 participants (see   for descriptive data): controls (CR; doses per occasion < 2; occasions per week < 1; consumption speed < 1) and binge drinkers (BD; doses per occasion > 5; occasions per week > 3; consumption speed > 2). One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed to check if the participants were correctly distributed across groups. These analyses showed that groups did not significantly differ for age at first alcohol consumption [  F  (1,22) = 1.03, NS], but binge drinkers presented as expected higher number of drinking occasions per week [  F  (1,22) = 94.78, p < .001], doses per occasion [  F  (1,22) = 72.67, p < .001], doses per week [  F  (1,22) = 35,26, p < .001] and drunkenness episodes [  F  (1,22) = 12.69, p < .01] than controls, as well as a faster consumption speed [  F  (1,22) = 10.05, p < .01]. Groups were matched for age (age range: 19–32 years in each group), gender (7 males per group) and education. Education level was assessed according to the number of years of education completed since starting primary school. Participants were asked to abstain from any alcohol consumption for at least three days before the scanning session. Before starting the fMRI study, a brief hearing test was performed to ensure that all participants were of normal hearing, and they were assessed for psychological control measures to evaluate subclinical depression (BDI), anxiety (STAI A–B) and current alcohol craving (as assessed by the Obsessive–Compulsive Drinking Scale, OCDS ( )). Participants were provided with full details regarding the aims of the study and the procedure to be followed. After receiving this information, all participants gave their informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were reimbursed £12 for their time. 


### Stimuli and tasks 
  
Participants performed a two-alternative forced choice task regarding one of two emotion categories of morphed affective bursts. Original recordings were taken from the Montreal Affective Voices Battery ( ) in which actors were instructed to produce emotional interjections using the vowel /a/. We chose four identities (two female), each expressing two emotions (anger and fear). The use of auditory stimuli expressing negative emotions is justified by earlier studies showing a strong deficit for the processing of these stimuli in alcohol-dependence and binge drinking ( ). Stimuli were normalised in energy (root mean square) before and after morphing. Angry to fearful continua were created separately for each identity, in seven steps that corresponded to 5/95%, 20/80%, 35/65%, 50/50%, 65/35%, 80/20% and 95/5% fear/anger. The duration of the bursts within each continuum was kept constant (range: .6–9 s). We used STRAIGHT software ( ) for stimulus manipulation and Psychtoolbox3 ( ) for stimulus presentation and response recording. Both programmes are based on MatlabR2009b (Mathworks, Inc.). Acoustic analyses of the stimuli are published elsewhere ( ). 

A continuous carry-over design ( ) was employed to control for the effects of one stimulus upon the next using a first-order serially balanced sequence of stimuli known as type-1-index-1 ( ). In this sequence each stimulus is preceded and followed by every other stimulus (seven morph steps and one silence, i.e. a period without auditory stimulation) with an equal number of times, totalling 65 stimuli. The sequence was repeated six times in each of three runs. Each run started with two silences, and each sequence of 65 stimuli was followed by nine TRs of silences. The total number of events per run was thus 446 (each corresponding to one fMRI volume), and the total number of trials for each morph step was 144. 

Stimuli were presented binaurally using the electrostatic NNL headphone system (NordicNeuroLab, Inc.) at 80 dB SPL(C). Participants were asked to perform a two-alternative forced choice task in which each affective voice had to be categorised as angry or fearful by means of two button presses mounted on an MRI compatible response box (NordicNeuroLab, Inc.). Subjects had to react as fast as possible and keep their eyes closed. Response to each stimulus and reaction times were recorded. Only correct answers were considered for behavioural analysis. As the 50/50% morph step equally comprises fear and anger, there is no correct response for this level, and it has not been included in the behavioural analyses. Before the experiment, each subject underwent a short training session to practise the task. 


### Imaging procedure and fMRI data analysis 
  
Scans were acquired in a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Tim Trio scanner using a 12-channel head coil. Whole brain T1-weighted anatomical scans were performed using fast gradient echo known as T1 ‘Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo’ (MPRAGE) consisting of 192 axial slices of 1 mm thickness with an inplane resolution of 1 × 1 × 1 (FOV = 256) and a matrix of 256 × 256 performed at the end of the experiment. T2-weighted functional scans were acquired using an interleaved ascending sequence consisting of 32 slices of 3 mm thickness (3 mm gap) with an inplane resolution of 3 × 3 × 3 (FOV = 1260) and an acquisition matrix of 70 × 70. The three runs (TR = 2 s, TE = 30 ms) consisted of 446 volumes each. The presentation of a stimulus coincided with the beginning of the TR. Vocal stimuli ranged in duration between 600 and 900 ms. A voice localizer scan (TR = 2 s, TE = 30 ms, 310 volumes) was performed before the experimental scans, allowing reliable identification of the temporal voice areas using the vocal versus non-vocal contrast ( ). This voice localizer tested whether groups differed concerning basic cerebral activations related to human voice processing. 

All MRI data were analysed using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University College London). Pre-processing of functional scans consisted of corrections for head motion (trilinear interpolation) and scans were realigned to the first volume. Functional runs were then coregistered to their corresponding individual anatomical scans. Functional (3 mm isotropic voxels) and anatomical (1 mm isotropic voxels) data were transformed to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space after segmentation of the anatomical scans. Normalised data were spatially smoothed by applying a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). Condition-related changes in regional brain activity were estimated for each participant by computing the contrasts between the mean hemodynamic responses evoked by each morph step relative to the silent baseline periods between runs. Significant cerebral activations were then examined by means of a full-factorial model with group as between-subjects factor and morph step as within-subjects factor. The statistical threshold was set to p < .05 FWE-corrected at cluster level for multiple comparisons with a cluster size of at least 10 contiguous voxels. Random effects analyses with one-sample t-tests were also used to explore the global activations found in each group and each emotion type, with statistical threshold set to p < .05 FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster size and extending to at least 20 voxels. Beta-values of the peak activity recorded in the superior temporal and middle frontal gyri were extracted using rfxplot toolbox ( ) in order to perform Pearson's correlations with behavioural data. 



## Results 
  
### Demographic and psychopathological measures 
  
ANOVAs showed that groups did not significantly differ for age [  F  (1,22) = .18, NS], gender, educational level [  F  (1,22) = 3.92, NS], depression [  F  (1,22) = 2.50, NS], state anxiety [  F  (1,22) = .44, NS], trait anxiety [  F  (1,22) = .35, NS] and alcohol craving [  F  (1,22) = 1.57, NS], confirming the correct matching of groups. These results are described in  . 


### Behavioural data 
  
These results are shown in  . 6 × 2 ANOVAs with morph step (5–20–35–65–80–95% of fear) as within-factor and group (CR, BD) as between-factor were conducted separately for reaction times and behavioural responses, with post-hoc paired-samples t-tests:   
Reaction times: we found no significant group effect [  F  (1,22) = .39, NS] and no group X morph step interaction [  F  (5,110) = 1.23, NS], but obtained a significant main effect of morph step [  F  (1,22) = 94.78, p < .001] which was due to shorter reaction times to the less ambiguous morphs. 
  
Behavioural responses: we found no group X morph step interaction [  F  (5,110) = .73, NS] but a significant group effect [  F  (1,22) = 9.62, p < .01] was identified: BD presented lower correct response rates than CR, independently of the morph step. We also obtained a significant main effect of morph step [  F  (5,110) = 24.94, p < .001], which was driven by higher correct response rates for the less ambiguous morphs. 
  


### fMRI data 
  
The voice localizer showed the classical activations in areas along bilateral superior temporal sulcus/superior temporal gyrus ( ) for both groups with no significant group differences. The 7 × 2 full-factorial model with morph step as within-factor and group (CR, BD) as between-factor showed two main effects:   
Main effect of morph step ( , part a): Both anger (i.e. 5–20–35% morph steps) and fear (i.e. 65–80–95% morph steps) bursts activated right cerebellum, left inferior frontal gyrus, left supplementary motor area and bilateral superior temporal gyri. Moreover, activations were found in bilateral thalami for anger stimuli and in left insula, right amygdala and right medial frontal gyrus for fear stimuli. The main effect of morph step showed that: (1) anger stimuli led to significantly higher activations than fear ones in left inferior frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area; and (2) fear stimuli led to higher activations than anger in bilateral insula and right medial frontal gyrus. 
  
Main effect of group ( , part b): Both groups presented significant activations in right cerebellum, right inferior and medial frontal gyri, bilateral superior temporal gyri and left thalamus. Moreover, activations were found in left inferior parietal lobule for binge drinkers. The main effect of group showed that: (1) control participants presented higher activations than binge drinkers in bilateral superior temporal gyri; and (2) binge drinkers presented higher activations than controls in right middle frontal gyrus. These results are illustrated in  . 
  
No significant activations were found for the interaction between group and morph step. 
  


### Correlational analyses 
  
Pearson's correlations were performed to explore the links between:   
Behavioural results and cerebral activations: A significant positive correlation was found between behavioural accuracy (i.e. percentage of correct responses) and peak voxel activity in the superior temporal gyri (r = 0.435, p < .05), higher activation in the superior temporal gyri thus being related to better performance. Moreover, a significant negative correlation was found between behavioural reaction times and peak voxel activity in the middle frontal gyri (r = − 0.387, p < .05), higher activation in the middle frontal gyri thus being related to shorter reaction times. 
  
Superior temporal and middle frontal gyrus activations: a significant negative correlation was found between the peak voxel activity in the superior temporal and middle frontal gyri (r = − 0.338, p < .05) showing that a reduced activation of the superior temporal gyri is linked with increased activation in the middle frontal gyri. 
  



## Discussion 
  
This study was the first to explore the cerebral correlates of emotional processing in binge drinking, and the results clearly suggest that binge drinkers present impaired behavioural and cerebral processing of emotional bursts. At the behavioural level, binge drinkers presented altered processing of negative prosody, which constitutes the primary observation of impaired emotional decoding in this population. At the neuroimaging level, the classical activation pattern related to emotional bursts processing was totally replicated: In both groups, both emotions activated the bilateral superior temporal gyri (the key region for human voice processing ( )) and the left inferior frontal gyrus (involved in the conscious categorization of emotional sounds ( )). Moreover, in line with earlier results, fear led to increased activations in the amygdala, insula and medial frontal gyrus ( ), while anger led to increased activations in the inferior frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area ( ). More centrally, two main group differences were found: (1) Binge drinkers had reduced activations in bilateral superior temporal gyri, which is involved in the processing of affective bursts ( ). This result corroborates behavioural ones and constitutes the first description of the cerebral correlates of impaired prosody processing in binge drinking; and (2) Binge drinkers had increased activations in the right middle frontal gyrus. This region is involved in the processing of the social characteristics of human voice ( ) and is strongly connected with the superior temporal gyrus ( ), but is not directly involved in the decoding of affective bursts. 

These increased frontal activations among binge drinkers reflect the enhanced involvement of alternative areas usually not activated during affective bursts processing, and could index a compensatory activity aiming at counterbalancing the reduced activations in the superior temporal gyri. Earlier studies already showed increased frontal and parietal activations among populations with alcohol-related problems to compensate for impaired temporal activations during memory tasks ( ). The present results reinforce this “compensation hypothesis” suggesting that binge drinking leads to a double functional change: reduced activation of the areas typically activated during the task and increased activation of alternative regions to compensate for this deficit. This suggestion is further reinforced by the correlational analyses, as they showed (1) that higher activity in the middle frontal gyri is associated with improved performance (i.e. faster reaction times), confirming that increasing the activity of this area can lead to faster emotional processing and (2) centrally, that the activations of the superior temporal gyri and middle frontal gyri are negatively correlated, which support the proposal that the increased middle frontal gyrus activations might compensate altered superior temporal gyrus functioning. Our results also support the “continuum hypothesis” ( ) suggesting that binge drinking and alcohol-dependence could constitute two successive steps of a same pathology, leading to analogous impairments. Indeed, as alcohol-dependence is associated with marked emotion decoding deficits ( ) and marked grey matter loss in the superior temporal gyri ( ), the similarities between our results in binge drinking and earlier ones in alcohol-dependence are in line with the proposal of a continuum in the brain deficits between these two populations. This “continuum hypothesis” should nevertheless be specifically tested in studies offering a direct comparison between binge drinkers and alcohol-dependent individuals. Moreover, the cerebral correlates of the transition from binge drinking to alcohol-dependence should also be explored, as it could be postulated that binge drinkers are still able to activate alternative brain areas to compensate for impaired activations, while during the evolution towards alcohol-dependence, this compensation might disappear due to the generalisation of brain impairments, particularly in frontal areas ( ). 

Centrally, our results confirmed our main hypothesis by showing for the first time that cerebral changes in binge drinking are present not only during cognitive processes but also during affective ones, and that binge drinking is deleterious not only for the adolescent brain but also among young adults. Importantly, the strict control of comorbidities ensures that these cerebral changes observed are related to alcohol consumption per se and not to other drug dependence or psychopathological states. It should however be noted that, while we postulate (in line with earlier longitudinal studies ( )) that these cerebral changes are the direct consequence of alcohol consumption, the reverse causation cannot be totally excluded as several brain modifications could precede and influence the development of binge drinking habits ( ). The absence of group effect concerning current alcohol craving also suggests that the results are not due to stronger alcohol-related thoughts (which might have impaired the performance) among binge drinkers. In view of the limited sample size and variety of emotional bursts, future studies on larger populations are needed to confirm these results, notably to explore the specificity of these deficits for emotional processing (by including control non-emotional stimuli) and the persistence of these brain changes when binge drinking habits end. Moreover, while the participants were repeatedly asked to avoid any alcohol consumption during the three days preceding scanning, the absence of acute alcohol consumption measure at testing day does not allow to totally make sure that no participant had consumed alcohol in the days preceding scanning. Despite these limits, this study clearly shows that binge drinking is associated with impaired emotional processing, as indexed by reduced performance in affective bursts categorization and decreased activations in superior temporal gyri. Moreover, the increased activations in an alternative voice processing network among binge drinkers support the “compensation hypothesis” ( ) and show that binge drinking leads to a reorganisation of brain functioning, combining reduced and increased activations. 

In conclusion, the present results offer the first insights concerning the cerebral correlates of emotional impairments in binge drinking and could constitute a first step towards the development of the affective neurosciences of binge drinking, potentially bearing crucial fundamental and clinical implications. At the experimental level, this could shed new light on the causes and development of alcohol-dependence by underlining the involvement of emotional impairments in the early stages of this pathology. At the therapeutic level, understanding emotional impairments in binge drinking could assist in the development of prophylactic interventions such as focusing on the rehabilitation of emotional and interpersonal skills. Our results highlight that binge drinking, despite constituting a widespread alcohol consumption habit among young people in Western countries, is associated with deleterious effects at behavioural and cerebral levels. We contribute to a growing body of literature emphasising the urgent need for more education among binge drinkers and for a reconsideration of public health policies among adolescents and young adults.

# Abstract
 
Characterizing the nature of developmental change is critical to understanding the mechanisms that are impaired in complex neurodevelopment disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and, pragmatically, may allow us to pinpoint periods of plasticity when interventions are particularly useful. Although aberrant brain development has long been theorized as a characteristic feature of ASD, the neural substrates have been difficult to characterize, in part due to a lack of developmental data and to performance confounds. To address these issues, we examined the development of intrinsic functional connectivity, with resting state fMRI from late childhood to early adulthood (8–36 years), using a seed based functional connectivity method with the striatal regions. Overall, we found that both groups show decreases in cortico-striatal circuits over age. However, when controlling for age, ASD participants showed increased connectivity with parietal cortex and decreased connectivity with prefrontal cortex relative to typically developed (TD) participants. In addition, ASD participants showed aberrant age-related connectivity with anterior aspects of cerebellum, and posterior temporal regions (e.g., fusiform gyrus, inferior and superior temporal gyri). In sum, we found prominent differences in the development of striatal connectivity in ASD, most notably, atypical development of connectivity in striatal networks that may underlie cognitive and social reward processing. Our findings highlight the need to identify the biological mechanisms of perturbations in brain reorganization over development, which may also help clarify discrepant findings in the literature.

## Introduction 
  
A recent focus in autism research is the differences in functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Early studies suggested that functional connectivity was altered in ASD during tasks examining executive function (Koshino et al.,  ,  ; Just et al.,  ; Mostofsky et al.,  ), language (Just et al.,  ; Kana et al.,  ), face processing (Kleinhans et al.,  ), social-emotion processing (Welchew et al.,  ; Rudie et al.,  ), selective attention (Keehn et al.,  ), and visuomotor coordination (Mizuno et al.,  ; Mostofsky et al.,  ). These findings have led to the strong hypothesis that ASD is a “disorder of abnormal brain connectivity” (Belmonte et al.,  ; Frith,  ; Just et al.,  ; Geschwind and Levitt,  ; Hughes,  ; Minshew and Williams,  ; Ecker et al.,  ), with the predominant theory being that hypo-connectivity, was core to the pathophysiology of the disorder. However, results from task-related functional connectivity studies have been mixed as reports indicate both hypo- and hyper- functional connectivity in ASD relative to typically developing (TD) individuals (Muller et al.,  ). 

Examining resting state functional connectivity may help address some of the discrepant findings, as it provides a measure of intrinsic functional connectivity without the task-related differences that confound comparisons across different age and clinical groups. However, similar to the task-based literature, much of the prior resting state connectivity research testing individuals with ASD has suggested overall decreases in intrinsic connectivity (Cherkassky et al.,  ; Kennedy and Courchesne,  ; Monk et al.,  ; Assaf et al.,  ; Jones et al.,  ; Weng et al.,  ; Anderson et al.,  ; Dinstein et al.,  ; Ebisch et al.,  ; Gotts et al.,  ; Rudie et al.,  ; Mueller et al.,  ; Tyszka et al.,  ; von dem Hagen et al.,  ), while some others have found increases (Noonan et al.,  ; Di Martino et al.,  ; Delmonte et al.,  ; Lynch et al.,  ; Uddin et al.,  ; Washington et al.,  ). Taken together, these findings suggest that the nature of connectivity differences in ASD is not yet fully characterized. Inconsistent findings in functional connectivity might be due to many important differences between various studies (e.g., data acquisition and analysis, small sample sizes, diagnostic criteria). It is especially likely that differences in age ranges and a lack of examination of developmental changes contribute to conflicting reports in the literature (for review, see Uddin et al.,  ). In general, developmental work in ASD is limited, with a few prior studies examining age-related change in gray matter (Langen et al.,  ; Greimel et al.,  ), structural connectivity (Kleinhans et al.,  ), behavior (Luna et al.,  ), task modulated brain function (Schulte-Ruther et al.,  ), and resting state connectivity with the default mode network (Wiggins et al.,  ). The majority of these studies report atypical trajectories in ASD. Given that (1) typical connectivity develops substantially, with connectivity patterns changing well into adulthood (Fair et al.,  ; Hwang and Luna,  ), (2) group differences may manifest differently at different time points over the lifespan, and (3) ASD is characterized as a disorder of abnormal and delayed development in the brain, there is a strong possibility that functional connectivity matures differently in ASD. Thus, examining age-related changes in brain connectivity is crucial to understanding the neural basis of ASD. Importantly, there is a need to clarify the nature of developmental change (Figure  ). For example, developmental abnormalities can be classified as arrested (a lack of development) (Figure  ), or atypical (a deviating developmental trajectory) (Figures  ). In addition, it is important to know if regions show intact development in ASD (Figure  ), or no developmental changes, but show persistent disorder effects (Figure  ). Characterizing these patterns is essential to understanding the progression of the disorder and for identifying time points of plasticity and/or vulnerabilities. 
  
 Schematic of predicted models of age-related change in ASD and TD  . The ASD group is depicted with dashed lines and the TD with solid lines.   (A)   Both groups display age-related change, but do not differ in trajectories suggesting intact development in ASD.   (B)   Stable disorder effects that persist over development, with no age-related changes.   (C)   TD group shows age-related change, but ASD group remains unchanged, suggesting a developmental arrest or delay.   (D)   Both groups display differential developmental trajectories that converge into adulthood (Equifinality).   (E,F)   Both groups display differential developmental trajectories that diverge in adulthood (Multifinality). 
  
One particularly understudied topic in the ASD literature is differences in connectivity with the striatum, an important subcortical region associated with a number of core cognitive and affective functions (Postuma and Dagher,  ) that are atypical in ASD-including social reward processing. The striatum, which includes the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens bilaterally, has extensive connections to cortex and cerebellum via the thalamus. Prior studies of functional connectivity during rest in typical adults have revealed a number of functionally distinct but overlapping cortico-striatal circuits (Di Martino et al.,  ; Kelly et al.,  ; Furman et al.,  ) that underlie core motor, cognitive, affective, and reward processes. Important for the current study, neuroimaging research has found structural and functional differences in ASD in the striatum. Structural neuroimaging studies have shown differences in striatal volume in both children and adults with ASD, specifically in the caudate nucleus (Stanfield et al.,  ; Langen et al.,  ; Qiu et al.,  ; Estes et al.,  ). Functional neuroimaging studies demonstrate striatal activation differences in children, adolescents, and adults with ASD (in separate studies) during tasks of sensorimotor control and higher order cognition (Schmitz et al.,  ; Takarae et al.,  ; Shafritz et al.,  ), social processing (Dapretto et al.,  ; Masten et al.,  ; Weng et al.,  ; Delmonte et al.,  ), and reward processing (Scott-Van Zeeland et al.,  ; Delmonte et al.,  ). Diffusion tensor imaging studies have previously shown decreased white matter connectivity between striatum and prefrontal cortex ASD relative to TD (Langen et al.,  ) or no group differences in adults (Delmonte et al.,  ). With regards to functional connectivity with striatum, most prior research has suggested hyper-connectivity. For example, Turner et al. ( ) found increased and more diffuse functional connectivity between the caudate nucleus and cortical areas such as prefrontal cortex, premotor areas, and parietal cortex in adults with ASD during a task of visuomotor coordination. Di Martino et al. ( ) reported increased cortico-striatal resting state connectivity in children with ASD relative to TD children and TD adults, and Delmonte et al. ( ) showed increased resting state connectivity between striatum (specifically caudate and nucleus accumbens) and prefrontal cortex in adults during rest. Di Martino et al. ( ) also reported aberrant as well as increased cortico-striatal connectivity in ASD children relative to TD children and TD adults. These differences were widespread but included limbic regions such as the insula and face processing regions such as the superior temporal cortex. Another prior resting state study reported hypo-connectivity between the ventral striatum and the temporal lobe in children with ASD (Abrams et al.,  ). Taken together, these findings suggest that striatal connectivity is atypical in ASD, and may be predominantly characterized by hyperconnectivity with cortical areas. To date, no study has examined the development of striatal functional connectivity in ASD from childhood to adulthood. 

The current study utilized resting state fMRI, expanding on previous work (Di Martino et al.,  ), to explore the development of the functional connectivity of the striatum in ASD and TD. We predicted that TD individuals would show decreasing cortico-striatal connectivity over development, consistent with previous literature (Supekar et al.,  ; Dosenbach et al.,  ). Given prior evidence of relative hyper-connectivity with striatum in both children and adults (Di Martino et al.,  ; Delmonte et al.,  ), we predicted that ASD individuals would overall show increased connectivity relative to typical individuals when controlling for age. We also predicted that ASD individuals would show both deviant and arrested development in connectivity with areas that change typically, especially with regions of the striatum known to support cognitive (dorsal caudate) and affective (ventral striatum) circuits, which may contribute to known behavioral impairments of the disorder. We did not have any directional hypotheses for age related differences in striatal connectivity between ASD and TD given the lack of prior developmental research in this area. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Forty-two ASD and 48 TD participants between the ages of 8 and 36 were tested. There were no differences in age (  p   = 0.88) and IQ (above 80;   p   = 0.81) between groups. Participants were recruited through the University of Pittsburgh Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) subject core (HD#055748). Participants were diagnosed with ASD using the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI; Lord et al.,  ) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-G (ADOS; Lord et al.,  ). Participants and/or their legal guardians provided consent and assent prior to being enrolled in the study, which was approved by the Internal Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh. The ASD group met cut-offs for autism on the ADI (except one individual in section D) and cut-offs for either autism or spectrum disorder on the ADOS, and an expert clinician confirmed diagnosis. Individuals were excluded from the ASD group if they reported concussions, vision problems, drug abuse, epilepsy, meningitis, and/or encephalitis. There were no effects of age on ADI scores or the ADOS social or final scores (  p  's > 0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons) though there was a significant effect of age on the ADOS communication score (  t   = 3.422,   p   = 0.002), increasing in severity with age. TD participants were recruited through the Autism Center for Excellence (Pittsburgh, PA) subject core. Exclusion criteria included learning disabilities and psychiatric disorders (individual and first-degree relative). All participants were screened for MR safety (absence of any metal and claustrophobia). See Table   for full description of participant demographics.

### Procedure 
  
All scans were conducted at the Neuroscience Imaging Center at the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh on a Siemens Allegra 3T MRI scanner. Participants first completed six runs of face and car memorization and recognition tasks. Next, we acquired Magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) and DTI sequences prior to the final resting state scan. The participants watched a movie of their choice during structural scans in order to reduce the potential for head movement. During the resting state scan, participants were instructed to lie in the scanner with their eyes closed but to remain awake. Functional images were obtained using a gradient echo, echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence sensitive to blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast (  TR   = 1500 ms,   TE   = 25 ms, flip angle = 70°, 29 4 mm slices axial slices, voxel size = 3.1 × 3.1 × 4, 200 volumes per run,   FOV   = 200 mm), interleaved slices MPRAGE sequences (  TR   = 2100 ms,   TE   = 3.93 ms, flip angle = 7°, 176 1 mm axial slices, voxel size = 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.1) were used to obtain structural images, prior to functional imaging. 


### fMRI preprocessing 
  
Each participant's resting scan data were motion corrected using AFNI (Cox,  ), using the first volume as a reference. To correct for signal corrupted by physiological noise, Physiologic EStimation by Temporal Independent Component Analysis (PESTICA v2.0) (Beall and Lowe,  ) was used to create respiration and cardiac estimators, and apply impulse response function retrospective correction of physiological motion effects (IRF-RETROICOR) (Beall,  ). These estimates were then filtered temporally based on the empirically derived default windows of 48–85 bpm for cardiac and 10–24 bpm for respiration and adjusted for dithering. Resulting images were then slice time corrected, aligned to the MPRAGE using FLIRT in FSL (Smith et al.,  ) and, scaled to the mean of each voxel. We used Freesurfer's automated segmentation program (Fischl et al.,  ) to segment gray matter, white matter, ventricles and non-brain tissue (NBT) in each participant's MPRAGE scan. These anatomical parcellations were used to extract signal from white matter, ventricles and NBT in the resting state fMRI scans. Using measures of head movement obtained from motion correction, we averaged translation and rotation values in the x, y, and z directions to calculate root mean square (RMS) of linear and angular precision. Next, using the ANATICOR program in AFNI (Jo et al.,  ), we reduced noise and artifacts from hardware, the draining vessel effect, and motion in each gray matter voxel by regressing out the following nuisance variables: (1) motion regressors for the standard 6 parameters, (2) local white matter regressors averaged from white matter voxels within a spherical mask (radius = 30 mm) centered at each gray matter voxel of interest, (3) ventricle signal regressors, and (4) NBT regressors. There were no significant differences in head motion across age (  P   = 0.15) or between groups (  P   = 0.25). Data were subsequently bandpass filtered at 0.009 Hz < f < 0.08 Hz and voxels were spatially smoothed using a 5 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Structural scans (MPRAGE) were warped to a standard template space using a template brain from the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI, Montreal, Canada) using FSL's non-linear registration procedure (FLIRT and FNIRT), and resulting warp coefficients were saved. Preprocessed fMRI data were spatially aligned and normalized to each participant's warped MPRAGE scan using FSL's non-linear registration procedure (FNIRT). Further, using the methods proposed by Power et al. ( ), we calculated frame-wise displacement (FD) and RMS variance of the temporal derivative of the time-series (DVARS). FD and DVARS values were used to identify volumes in the fMRI time series to remove from data analysis. There were no differences in FD between groups or across age (Figure  ) (  p  's > 0.05). Using the same threshold as Power et al. ( ) we removed volumes where FD exceeded 0.5 mm and DVARS exceeded 0.5% signal change. There were no significant differences between groups (  t   = 0.656,   p   = 0.513) or across age (  t   = −1.449,   p   = 0.151) for the number of volumes removed (TD: mean 26.08 ± 10.02, ASD: mean 30.66 ± 9.38). 


### Striatal volume analysis 
  
Given prior research suggesting that the structural development of the striatum differs in ASD relative to TD, we obtained volumetric measurements from the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens, and the whole brain using Freesurfer's automated segmentation tool (Fischl et al.,  ). We entered these values into linear regression models with age and age  as continuous variables, and diagnosis as a categorical variable. We chose to model both linear and quadratic functions of age given prior evidence that striatal structures show both linear and quadratic changes over development (Langen et al.,  ). We also examined whether striatal volume differed as a function of age or diagnosis therefore potentially introducing a confound. We found no age or diagnosis, group main effects or interactions on striatal volume for any of the six striatal structures even at an uncorrected threshold of   p   < 0.05. 


### fMRI data analysis 
  
We used functionally distinct seed regions of interest (ROI) in striatum, bilaterally, including the dorsal caudate (DC), inferior and superior ventral striatum (VSi, VSs), dorsal-caudal and dorsal-rostral putamen (dcP, drP), and ventral rostral putamen (vrP) as previously defined in the literature (Di Martino et al.,  ) (Table  ). Prior research using these seed regions has demonstrated increased connectivity in ASD children relative to TD children and adults, suggesting that developmental differences might exist (Di Martino et al.,  ). Striatal ROI's were manually inspected against each participant's warped MPRAGE to ensure that they all fell within the boundaries of the striatal regions that they represented. In each participant's resting scan images, using single value decomposition in AFNI (1dSVD), we extracted the first principal component vector in the time series for each of the 12 ROIs using AFNI (Cox,  ). In order to ensure that the first component time series was the most representative of all of the voxels in the seed, we correlated this time series with the average time series of each seed. Across participants and across all seed ROI's, the correlation values were above   r   = 0.99. We then correlated each first component vector with time series in every voxel in the brain. Resulting whole brain correlation maps were Z-transformed (Fisher r to z transformation) and entered into group-level regression models with diagnosis (ASD, TD) as a categorical factor and age as a continuous factor, controlling for sex. We also ran regression analyses to examine any non-linear relationships with age, including a quadratic model of age (age ), given prior research suggesting that striatal volume in ASD showed both quadratic and linear change with age (Langen et al.,  ). We generated maps of regions that exhibited positive and negative connectivity for each seed as a function of age within group (ASD, TD) as well as age by group interactions. We used a group inclusive mask, masking for regions that overlapped across all participants (Figure  ). To correct for multiple comparisons (family-wise error correction), we ran a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine cluster size at a voxel threshold of   p   = 0.005, and a cluster threshold of   p   = 0.004. We chose the value for the cluster threshold based on a Bonferroni correction for multiple seed regions (  p   = 0.05/12 seeds = 0.004).

Furthermore, as a secondary analysis, we excluded all participants over the age of 25, as we had fewer participants who exceeded this age, and reran the whole brain group analysis. We thus report resulting significant clusters that showed main effects of age or age , main effect of diagnosis group (controlling for age), and age by diagnosis group interaction, across all participants in regions that remained significant when we excluded participants over the age of 25 (in order to ensure that our age effects were not driven by the older participants). For the regions that showed an age by diagnosis interaction, average beta values were extracted for each individual and entered into linear regression models using the lm function in R (R Core Team,  ) to determine the direction of the developmental slope of each group. To assess the effect of autism diagnosis on connectivity, we ran separate regression models on the ASD group with age and ADI scores as independent variables (controlling for sex) in each of our resulting significant clusters. Lastly, given the recent discussions in the literature regarding the optimal methods of motion correction (e.g., Power et al.,  ; Satterthwaite et al.,  ), we reran our analyses without the motion censoring procedure and covaried FD at the group level. 



## Results 
  
For the analyses that included the quadratic function of age, we found no significant clusters. Therefore, all results reported below are based on regression models that included only linear relationships with age. We also did not find any significant effects of ADI scores on connectivity (all   p  's > 0.05). Lastly, we did not find differences in which clusters were significant when covarying FD at the group level. Therefore, we report our findings when employing the scrubbing procedure described previously. 

Our results were consistent with previous work on striatal connectivity and development. Collapsed across groups and age, we found patterns of positive correlations between the striatal seeds and a distributed set of cortical areas. Overall, connectivity patterns were similar to previously published research in TD adults (Di Martino et al.,  ) (Figures  ,  ). Independent of diagnostic group, we found decreases with age in connectivity between striatal seeds and a wide set of striatal and cortical regions including prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortices, and cerebellum (Figures  ,  ). Below, for each striatal seed, we first report clusters that showed a main effect of diagnosis group when controlling for age, to establish regions that show differences in ASD relative to TD overall (Figure  , Table  ). We then report clusters that showed significant group by age interactions (Figures  ,  , and Figure  , Table  ).

 Regions showing significant Age × Diagnosis Group Interactions  . 
    
### Dorsal caudate (DC) 
  
The DC has extensive connections with dorsal and lateral aspects of cortex involved in inhibitory control, working memory, and task switching. 

Group differences: We found no group differences between the DC when controlling for age. 

Whole brain group × age interaction: We found significant age by diagnosis interactions in connectivity between the left DC and right fusiform gyrus. TD individuals exhibited a significant decrease in connectivity with age, and ASD individuals showed increased connectivity with age. 


### Dorsal caudal and rostral putamen (dcP, drP) 
  
The dorsal putamen is involved in primary motor control including motor selection and execution. 

#### dcP 
  
Group differences: We found a main effect of diagnosis group in connectivity between the left dcP and the left superior medial gyrus, and between the right dcP and the left middle frontal gyrus. In both clusters, TD individuals exhibited increased connectivity relative to ASD. 


#### drP 
  
Group differences: With the left drP, the ASD group showed increased connectivity with the right superior and inferior parietal lobule, and decreased connectivity with the left superior medial, superior frontal, and inferior frontal gyri. With the right drP, the ASD group demonstrated decreased connectivity with the right parahippocampal gyrus, and increased connectivity with the superior occipital gyrus. 

Whole brain group × age interaction: We found no whole brain age group by diagnosis interactions with either the dcP or the drP. 



### Ventral rostral putamen (vrP) 
  
The ventral rostral putamen is implicated in cognitive control and executive function, with connections to the anterior cingulate, and regions of the insula. 

Group differences: Collapsed across age, the ASD group showed increased connectivity between the left vrP and right superior parietal lobule, and decreased connectivity between the right vrP and the right inferior frontal gyrus, relative to TD. 

Whole brain group × age interaction: There were significant age by diagnosis interactions in connectivity between the left vrP and the left medial temporal pole, the right fusiform gyrus, and the right superior temporal gyrus. We also found an interaction between the right vrP and the right inferior temporal gyrus. The ASD group showed increased connectivity with age, and the TD group showed significant decreases with age in all clusters except the superior temporal gyrus, which showed no change over development in the ASD group and a significant decrease in connectivity in the TD group. 


### Inferior and superior ventral striatum (VSi and VSs) 
  
The ventral striatum, which has connections to medial aspects of the prefrontal cortex, and other areas of the limbic system, is strongly implicated in reward-related processing. 

#### VSi 
  
Group differences: We found a significant group difference between the Right VSi and the right anterior cingulate cortex. 

Whole brain group × age interaction: Age by diagnosis group interactions were evident in connectivity from both VSi seeds to the bilateral cerebellum (Lobule VI and Lobule VIIa, Crus I). In addition, we found an interaction between the left VSi and the right amygdala and right fusiform gyrus, and between the right VSi and the left supplementary motor area. The ASD participants showed significant increases with age whereas TD showed decreases with age except with the right fusiform gyrus, where the ASD group showed no change with development. 


#### VSs 
  
Whole brain group × age interaction: There were significant age by diagnosis group interactions between both VSs seeds and the cerebellum (Lobules VI and VIIa, Crus I), precuneus, and right inferior temporal gyrus. The ASD group showed increased connectivity with age, whereas the TD group showed decreased connectivity with age. 




## Discussion 
  
We examined striatal resting state functional connectivity across the ages of 8–36 years in individuals diagnosed with ASD, relative to typically developing individuals. Using previously defined striatal seed ROIs (Di Martino et al.,  ), we identified connections associated with each seed, respectively, and examined changes in connectivity patterns across age and between diagnosis groups. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first to examine striatal functional connectivity in ASD across development, from late childhood to adulthood. Thus, our results provide a novel understanding of the development of functional connectivity with the striatum in ASD and identify connectivity patterns that parallel and deviate from typical development. 

Patterns of striatal functional connectivity in both individuals with ASD and TD individuals were consistent with previous studies utilizing the same seed regions in both child and adult populations separately (Di Martino et al.,  ,  ; Kelly et al.,  ; Furman et al.,  ). In general, we noted a dorsal to ventral and medial to lateral gradient, where more dorsal seeds in striatum were significantly connected to dorsal and lateral aspects of cortex, and ventral areas of striatum connected to more medial and ventral cortical regions. This is consistent with purported cognitive/affective divisions previously identified in cortico-striatal circuits using the same seed regions (Di Martino et al.,  ). Collapsed across diagnostic groups, we found decreases in connectivity between all striatal seeds and various cortical areas across age, consistent with studies of typical development, which may reflect necessary decreases in striatal influence over cortical function, supporting the emergence of long-range cortico-cortico connectivity in adulthood (Fair et al.,  ,  ; Kelly et al.,  ; Supekar et al.,  ; Dosenbach et al.,  ). As developmental changes that occur in typically developing individuals are often interpreted as necessary for maturation into adulthood, regions that show similar age-related change with TD suggest intact development in ASD. Thus, deviations from typical maturation may indicate development of compensatory connections or impairments that persist into adulthood. 

Stable disorder effects (i.e., connections that are atypical in ASD independent of age) were noted with only the putamen and the inferior ventral striatum seeds, and suggest that posterior connections (superior and inferior parietal lobule) are increased, whereas anterior connections (anterior cingulate and superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri) are decreased in ASD. Previous resting state functional connectivity studies using the striatum did not find differences in the posterior parietal cortex, and differences with the prefrontal cortex have been in the opposite direction with ASD individuals (both children and adults) showing increased striatal-prefrontal connectivity relative to typicals (Turner et al.,  ; Di Martino et al.,  ; Delmonte et al.,  ) with some studies reporting no differences (Kennedy and Courchesne,  ; Tyszka et al.,  ). Discrepant findings previously might have been specific to the age groups tested, whereas the present study controlled for age-related changes when examining group differences. We suggest that there are differences in network connectivity in ASD that is characterized by both hypo- and hyper- connectivity in a region specific manner. Although the behavioral implications of these findings are unclear, these novel results highlight atypical connectivity patterns that are unchanged with development (see Figure  ). One caveat to the interpretation of these group level findings in relation to prior results must be highlighted. We did not include the average global time series as a nuisance regressor (GSR), as prior studies did due to our use of the PESTICA program to estimate and remove the effects of physiological noise, as well as the recent evidence in the literature regarding the potential spurious correlations that may arise when using GSR with seed based resting state analyses in both typical (Saad et al.,  ), and ASD samples (Gotts et al.,  ). A recent resting state study in children with ASD suggested that GSR does not significantly alter resting state results (Di Martino et al.,  ), although those findings were specific to a different measure of connectivity [network centrality—which may be less affected by GSR (Yan et al.,  )] than the seed based correlations used in the current study. Although differences in preprocessing is a limitation in our ability to compare our results to previous findings, nonetheless, we estimated and removed physiological noise without the potential confounds of GSR. As it is vital that results be comparable in the literature, and future developmental work in ASD should consider both GSR and non-GSR approaches in analysis and interpretation. 

The predominant goal of the current study was to identify regions that showed age-related differences from late childhood to adulthood in ASD relative to TD. Within the majority of clusters that showed age by diagnosis group interactions, the TD individuals showed significant developmental decreases, whereas the ASD group showed increases with age, suggesting deviating developmental trajectories into adulthood. Similar to the direction of results in the current study, prior research has suggested that maturation of white matter connectivity is aberrant in ASD relative to TD in a similar fashion in roughly the same age range (10–40), with ASD participants showing increased white matter integrity in subcortical to cortical projection tracts across age, whereas TD participants showed decreased white matter connectivity (Kleinhans et al.,  ). It is possible that age-related differences in structural connectivity in subcortical-cortical tracts underlie the functional differences noted in the present study. 

Notably, age by diagnosis interactions revealed that the connectivity between striatum and superior aspects of the cerebellum, specifically with regions VI and VIIa (including Crus I) were decreased in TD participants but increased in ASD. These differences in the development of cerebellar connectivity are not surprising given the convergence of evidence targeting the cerebellum as a locus of abnormality in ASD (Courchesne et al.,  ; Nowinski et al.,  ; for review see Fatemi et al.,  ). The cerebellum has extensive connections with cortical and subcortical brain regions, including bidirectional connections with striatum (Habas et al.,  ; Krienen and Buckner,  ; Strick et al.,  ; Bostan and Strick,  ). Studies have previously shown that individuals with lesions in cerebellar areas including lobules VI and VIIa demonstrate cognitive impairments such as motor control and planning, attention, sensory integration, language, and affective processes (Habas et al.,  ; Krienen and Buckner,  ; Stoodley et al.,  ), all of which are known to be affected in ASD. Furthermore, structural MRI research has found reduced overall cerebellar as well as reduced regional gray matter volume in children, adolescents and adults with ASD (Hashimoto et al.,  ; Bauman and Kemper,  ; Stanfield et al.,  ; Riva et al.,  ). Functional MRI research has demonstrated atypical cerebellar activation during motor control (Muller et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ; Mostofsky et al.,  ), and attention (Allen and Courchesne,  ) in children, adolescent and adults with ASD separately. Finally, functional connectivity findings suggest reduced connectivity between cerebellum and motor execution areas (e.g., sensorimotor and supplementary motor cortices) in children with ASD (Mostofsky et al.,  ). These findings highlight a potential developmental deficit where initial hypoconnectivity relative to TD may be later compensated with relative hyperconnectivity in adulthood, specifically in more ventral aspects of striatum that are involved in reward processing (VSi and VSs). As we did not find any significant correlations with our cerebellar clusters and ADI scores, further work will have to explore the behavioral implications of the aberrant development of cerebellar connectivity in ASD. It is important to note one limitation with our cerebellar results; due to differences in head size between participants, we were unable to acquire complete coverage of cerebellum across all participants. Therefore, our results were limited to the anterior and superior portions of the cerebellum. It is possible that there are connectivity differences with inferior aspects of the cerebellum that we were unable to detect. 

The inferior and superior temporal gyri (ITG and STG) and the fusiform gyrus (FG) also showed age by diagnosis group interactions, mainly demonstrating increased connectivity with age in ASD, and decreased in TD. Two clusters suggested developmental arrests or delays in ASD (showing no change with age), and significant decreases with TD; connectivity between the left vrP and the superior temporal gyrus, and the left VSi and the right fusiform gyrus. Structural abnormalities of the temporal gyri gray matter have also been reported in children, adolescents, and adults with ASD, which may contribute to differences in the development of connectivity with temporal regions (Jou et al.,  ; Toal et al.,  ). ITG and FG connectivity differences were found in connections with both dorsal and ventral aspects of the striatum. The ITG and FG, which are components of the ventral stream visual pathway with direct connections to occipital cortex, are largely implicated with face processing, face recognition, and in discrimination of facial expression, including affective interpretation, which may be affected in ASD (Sergent et al.,  ; Kanwisher et al.,  ; Apps et al.,  ; Prochnow et al.,  ). Exaggerated ITG activation and reduced FG activation during face perception in young adults with ASD has also previously been reported (Schultz et al.,  ; Coutanche et al.,  ). The STG has previously been implicated in social communication abnormalities in ASD (Frith,  ; Wang et al.,  ; Pelphrey et al.,  ; Hubbard et al.,  ). Therefore, abnormalities in striatal connectivity with the temporal cortex may underlie social and/or social reward deficits. 

We also found a significant age by group interaction between the inferior ventral striatum and the amygdala. Several prior studies have reported altered activation in and reduced connectivity with the amygdala in association with social perception deficits in ASD (e.g., Kleinhans et al.,  ; Pelphrey and Carter,  ; Sato et al.,  ), although these findings were with the ITG and not striatum. Given the role of the ventral striatum in reward-related processing and its extensive connections to the amygdala, it is possible that aberrant functional connectivity between striatum and amygdala underlies deficits in social rewards in ASD, which may increase in a compensatory fashion over development (e.g., Delmonte et al.,  ; Sepeta et al.,  ). 

This is the first study to examine age related change in functional connectivity with striatum in ASD compared to typical development. We identified a number of connections, with a range of brain regions, showing atypical development from late childhood to adulthood. Importantly, we found that social processing regions such as ITG, STG, and FG, and cerebellar regions implicated in cognitive and motor functions demonstrated a decrease in connectivity over development in TD, but an increase in ASD. As these are novel findings, replication will be necessary, especially given recent debates in the literature regarding methodological considerations related to head motion (e.g., Power et al.,  ; Satterthwaite et al.,  ; Yan et al.,  ), and the removal of nuisance variables such as physiological noise and/or the global signal e.g., when analyzing resting state data. In addition, it is likely that larger sample sizes, wider age ranges, and longitudinal data are needed to replicate these findings, and perhaps identify patterns that the current study may not have had the power to detect, including correlations with symptoms of ASD, identifying regions that show developmental delays, and non-linear trajectories. Despite these limitations, our findings were robust and highlight the important notion that examining the progression of ASD over development is crucial for identifying the neural bases of ASD and how they relate to behavioral impairments in the disorder.

# Abstract
 
This study examined the effects of linguistic task demands on the neuroanatomical localization of the neural response related to automatic semantic processing of concrete German nouns combining the associative priming paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To clarify the functional role of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) for semantic processing with respect to semantic decision making compared to semantic processing per se, we used a linguistic task that involved either a binary decision process (i.e., semantic categorization; Experiment 1) or not (i.e., silently thinking about a word's meaning; Experiment 2). We observed associative priming effects indicated as neural suppression in bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), occipito-temporal brain areas, and in medial frontal brain areas independently of the linguistic task. Inferior parietal brain areas were more active for silently thinking about a word's meaning compared to semantic categorization. A conjunction analysis of linguistic task revealed that both tasks activated the same left-lateralized occipito-temporo-frontal network including the IFG. Contrasting neural associative priming effects across linguistic task demands, we found a significant interaction in the right IFG. The present fMRI data give rise to the assumption that activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) in the semantic domain might be important for semantic processing in general and not only for semantic decision making. These findings contrast with a recent study regarding the role of the LIFG for binary decision making in the lexical domain (Wright et al. 2011).

## Introduction 
  
While automatic language processes are described as proceeding without awareness and producing benefits and no costs, controlled language processes are described as slower acting and requiring effort and awareness (Posner and Snyder  ). In Psycholinguistics, behavioral evidence from priming studies on lexical access suggests that automatic lexical retrieval can be affected by controlled strategic processes depending on experimental parameters such as the stimulus onset asynchrony  (SOA; De Groot  ; Altarriba and Basnight-Brown  ), the proportion of related prime–target pairs (PRP; De Groot  ; Altarriba and Basnight-Brown  ) and the linguistic task (De Groot  ; Balota and Chumbley  ; Balota and Lorch  ; for reviews, Neely  ; McNamara and Holbrook  ). The present priming study focused on the effect of linguistic tasks on the neural response related to automatic lexical-semantic processing. In the light of a considerable controversy regarding the exact function of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) in lexical-semantic processing with respect to language-specific versus domain-general cognitive functions (decision making), we examined the functional role of the LIFG using two semantic linguistic tasks that differed in the presence of a binary decision process. Recently, Wright et al. ( ) investigated the role of the LIFG by studying the neural effects of lexical processing with respect to a binary decision process using a lexical-decision task (LDT) and a passive listening task. They showed that activation of the LIFG was larger for the LDT than the passive listening task. In contrast, passive listening elicited higher activations in a cluster composed of the right superior and middle temporal gyri (STG, MTG). At first glance, the absence of activation in the LIFG for passive listening reported by Wright et al. ( ) supports the view that LIFG may be involved in semantic decision making only. However, neural semantic priming effects (Wheatley et al.  ; i.e., suppression of neural activation for related compared to unrelated word pairs) and neural word repetition priming effects (Chee et al.  ) have been reported in the LIFG with linguistic tasks that did not require a binary response, namely silent reading and silently thinking about the meaning of words. The absence of consensus between the studies of Wheatley et al. ( ), Chee et al. ( ), and Wright et al. ( ) may be due to the fact that both the paradigms (Priming vs. Word presentation) and the linguistic tasks (Silently reading vs. Passive listening) did not activate semantic properties of words in the same way. In the present research, using the same experimental design and the same linguistic materials, we compared the neural response related to lexical-semantic processing by contrasting two semantic tasks that involved either a binary decision process (i.e., semantic categorization task: natural/manmade decision; Experiment 1) or not (i.e., silently thinking about a word's meaning; Experiment 2). 

The role of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in semantics was intensively investigated in the last two decades (for a review, Thompson-Schill et al.  ; Bookheimer  ; Noppeney et al.  ). Activation of the LIFG is discussed as especially contributing to the processes required for semantic decision making (Demb et al.  ; Gabrieli et al.  ; Wagner et al.  ; Roskies et al.  ) and strategic semantic retrieval (Sylvester and Shimamura  ). 

Semantic processing using lexical tasks involving a binary decision like the LDT, semantic judgment or categorization tasks shared activations in temporal brain areas such as the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), the MTG, and the STG, in the inferior parietal lobe (IPL), and particularly, in the LIFG (Demb et al.  ; Roskies et al.  ; Wagner et al.  ; Kotz et al.  ; Copland et al.  ; Rossell et al.  ; Giesbrecht et al.  ; Raposo et al.  ; Kuperberg et al.  ; Ruff et al.  ; Wright et al.  ). Roskies et al. ( ) showed that brain activation during a two-choice semantic synonym task (i.e., subjects indicated whether two words had the same meaning) compared to a rhyme-judgment task was modulated within the LIFG. This task-driven activation of left inferior frontal regions was discussed as possibly subserving controlled “end-stage decision processes” that interact with other brain regions like the temporal cortex to access, select, gate, or retrieve semantic information stored in the lexical entries of the mental lexicon. This interpretation is in accordance with Wu et al. ( ) suggesting activation of a separate fronto-parietal network for semantic decision making and it matches the general role of frontal regions during cognitive control processes (Duncan et al.  ; Fuster  ; Miller and Cohen  ; Koechlin et al.  ). Recent neuroimaging studies showed that the neural response underlying semantic processing in semantic priming paradigms was affected by the explicit (Semantic judgment task vs. LDT) versus implicit nature of a binary linguistic decision task (Kuperberg et al.  ; Ruff et al.  ). Thus, semantic priming in implicit tasks was related to semantic suppression in the left anterior IFG and the right anterior orbito-frontal gyrus (Kuperberg et al.  ), as well as in the left STG and bilateral middle frontal gyri (cf., Rissman et al.  ). In contrast, for explicit semantic tasks, differential effects were observed with semantic suppression in the LIFG by Ruff et al. ( ), and semantic enhancement (i.e., increased neural activation for related compared to unrelated word pairs) in the left IPL by Kuperberg et al. ( ). Both studies showed consistent Task by Relatedness interactions in the left IPL with suppression for the LDT and enhancement for the semantic judgment task. Neural suppression effects for the implicit linguistic task might be explained by facilitated lexical access induced by either automatic spreading of activation that typically occur with short SOAs (i.e., 50 msec; Ruff et al.  ), or the use of semantic expectancy strategies that occur with long SOAs (i.e., 800 msec; Kuperberg et al.  ) as proposed before in lexical priming studies (Collins and Loftus  ; Copland et al.  ; Wheatley et al.  ; Gold et al.  ; Raposo et al.  ). In contrast, neural enhancement effects for the explicit semantic task might be related to postlexical semantic matching mechanisms that might have been induced by the explicit nature of the task and that are especially induced by high PRPs present in both studies (cf. also, Kotz et al.  ; Rossell et al.  ; Raposo et al.  ; Kuperberg et al.  ; for reviews, Henson  ; James and Gauthier  ). Although the findings of Kuperberg et al. ( ) and Ruff et al. ( ) underline that linguistic task effects affect the neural response related to semantic processing, both studies cannot shed light on the function of the LIFG with respect to automatic semantic processing because semantic processing might have been affected by lexical strategies induced either by large SOAs or large PRPs. In the present study, we tested the functional role of the LIFG in automatic semantic processing with respect to a semantic decision making process controlling for SOA and PRP. 

In contrast to linguistic tasks requiring a semantic or lexical decision, semantic processing using linguistic tasks that do not involve a binary decision process led primarily to activation of temporal brain regions including inferior, middle, and superior temporal regions (Petersen et al.  ; Howard et al.  ; Moore and Price  ; Wright et al.  ). The temporal brain areas are assumed to support activation of lexical entries within the mental lexicon (Howard et al.  ; Fiebach et al.  ). It appears that both kinds of tasks (i.e., with a binary decision or not) show neural effects in temporal brain areas but linguistic tasks involving a binary decision process seem also to involve activation of inferior frontal brain regions (cf., Wright et al.  ). However, as pointed out before, neural semantic and repetition priming effects have been found in the LIFG using linguistic tasks requiring no binary decision (Chee et al.  ; Wheatley et al.  ). So, activation of the LIFG in semantic processing seems not to be restricted to complex semantic retrieval demands like in a semantic decision making task. To date, no study directly compared the neural effects of a semantic task requiring a binary decision with a semantic task that did not. 


## Current Study 
  
In the present study, we evaluated the impact of a binary semantic decision process on the neuroanatomical localization of neural associative priming effects within a fronto-parieto-temporal network (including the IFG, ITG, STG, MTG, and IPL) that is assumed to support semantic processing at word level (for a review, see Price  ; Bookheimer  ; Wu et al.  ) by contrasting two semantic tasks that differed with respect to a binary semantic decision, (i.e., semantic categorization [Experiment 1], and silently thinking about a word's meaning [Experiment 2]). In both experiments, we used an associative priming paradigm with a short SOA (300 msec) and a low PRP (6.25%) to increase the chance to capture automatic lexical access of semantic representations assumed to be stored in each lexical entry. The focus lay on the functional role of the LIFG in semantic processing. 

We tested whether the LIFG was specifically activated by semantic tasks involving a binary decision process. For Experiment 1, we expected associative suppression effects in temporal and frontal brain areas with a predominant activation of the LIFG shown to be especially involved during semantic decision making (Demb et al.  ; Gabrieli et al.  ; Wagner et al.  ; Roskies et al.  ; Wu et al.  ). For Experiment 2, alternative hypotheses were formulated. If the LIFG was specifically task-related as suggested by Wright et al. ( ), then associative suppression effects should predominantly be observed in occipito-temporal regions (Petersen et al.  ; Howard et al.  ; Moore and Price  ; Fiebach et al.  ). However, if the LIFG also takes in charge lexical-semantic processing irrespective of the nature of the task, then similar results in Experiments 1 and 2 should be expected. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Thirty-six native speakers of German (17 females, 19 males, mean age = 26.45 ± 4.9, age range 21–41 years) recruited from a database available at the Department for Systems Neuroscience (University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany) took part in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. All participants were right-handed according to the Edinburgh Inventory (Oldfield  ; mean laterality index of 97.1 ± 5.05%). All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None had a history of neurological or psychiatric disease. All participants gave informed consent after the experimental procedure was explained and were paid for participation. This study was approved by the research ethical committee of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Eighteen of the 36 subjects (8 females and 10 males, mean age = 26.3 ± 4.6 years, age range: 21–41 years) were assigned pseudo-randomly to Experiment 1 (semantic categorization) and the remaining 18 subjects (9 females and 9 males, mean age = 26.6 ± 5.2 years, age range: 21–38 years) were assigned to Experiment 2 (silently thinking about a word's meaning). None of the subjects participating in Experiment 2 took part in Experiment 1. 


### Stimuli 
  
Critical items were 60 morphologically simplex concrete German nouns of the open class category. These items were adapted from a previous fMRI study of the neural representation of the bilingual mental lexicon (Isel et al.  ). Half of the words (  n   = 30) referred to natural entities (e.g., Frucht ), whereas the other half (  n   = 30) referred to manmade entities (e.g., Koffer ). The mean age of acquisition (AoA) of the critical words was 2.7 years (±0.1) for the 30 natural concrete nouns and 3.3 years (±0.1) for the 30 manmade concrete nouns. Target words were matched for word frequency (mean word frequency: natural nouns = 34 [SEM = 7.9], manmade nouns = 22 [SEM = 5.9]; CELEX database, Baayen et al.  ), word length (mean word length: natural nouns = 5.4 letters [SEM = 0.2], manmade nouns = 5.8 letters [SEM = 0.2]) as well as for concreteness and imageability (MRC Psycholinguistics database, Coltheart  ). Prime words in the related and unrelated conditions were matched for frequency (mean word frequency: related condition = 28 [SEM = 6.8], unrelated = 31 [SEM = 7.3]; CELEX database, Baayen et al.  ). 

In the related condition, prime–target word pairs were associatively related and therefore were matched for associative strength  (mean association strength: natural nouns = 39.7% [SEM = 2.9%], manmade nouns: 42.1% [SEM = 2.3%]). In the unrelated condition, prime and target words did not present either a phonological/orthographic, morphological, or semantic/associative link. Finally, in both the related and unrelated conditions, natural noun targets were primed by natural nouns whereas manmade noun targets were primed by manmade nouns. Table   displays examples of word pairs in the related and unrelated conditions. 
  
Examples of word pairs in the related and unrelated conditions 
    
In addition, we selected 420 filler pairs (300 word–word pairs, 60 “blank screen”–word pairs [12.5%; neutral condition], and 60 symbol pairs [12.5%]). Among the 300 word–word pairs, half of them were constituted of two natural nouns, whereas the other half was constituted of two manmade nouns. The nouns used for creating the filler pairs were matched on different dimensions (frequency, number of letters, imageability, and concreteness). For each word–word pair, the nature of the relation existing between the prime word and the target word was carefully inspected by two native speakers of German for ensuring that the two words did not share semantic or associative properties. All neutral pairs consisted of a blank screen of 300 msec followed by a target word (50% natural and 50% manmade words). Finally, half of the symbol pairs consisted of a series of six identical symbols (e.g., %%%%%%), whereas the other half was constituted of six different symbols consisting of the repetition of two different symbols (e.g., %$%$%$). 


### Experimental design 
  
In order to minimize the use of a possible postlexical semantic matching processing strategy, a low proportion of related prime–target pairs (PRP) was used (i.e., 6.25%). By means of a Latin square design, four experimental lists were created such that related (e.g., Saft −FRUCHT ) and unrelated (e.g., Anzeige −FRUCHT ) pairs were balanced across four different lists. Each target was presented under both priming conditions, but no participant saw the same prime or the same target twice, thus avoiding possible practice effects that could arise from multiple presentations of an item (Slowiaczek and Pisoni  ). Furthermore, although there was no orthographic overlap between prime and target words (i.e., a same letter at the same position in the word), primes were presented in lowercase letters, whereas targets were presented in capital letters in order to minimize sensorial match between primes and targets. In each list, the 30 related, 30 unrelated, and 420 filler pairs were organized into five sessions, with session order counterbalanced across subjects. Each session comprised 96 trials (6 related pairs, 6 unrelated pairs, and 84 filler pairs). In each session, item pairs were pseudo-randomly interspersed according to the two following constraints. First, each type of pair (related, unrelated, filler, neutral, symbol) was presented in no more than three consecutive trials. Second, no more than three pairs with natural or manmade targets were presented in succession. 


### Procedure 
  
In the related, unrelated, and filler conditions, two German words were presented successively. Each word-word trial consisted of a fixation cross presented in the middle of the screen for 500 msec that was followed by (1) a blank screen presented for 100 msec, (2) a written prime word presented in lowercase letters for 200 msec, (3) a blank screen for 100 msec, and (4) a written target word presented in capital letters and remaining on the screen until the participants responded (maximal response time was limited to 1800 msec; see Fig.  ). The same timing was applied for the neutral and symbol pairs. For the neutral pairs, the prime word was replaced by a blank screen for 200 msec. For the symbol pair, the prime word was replaced by a blank screen for 200 msec, and the target was replaced by a series of either identical or different symbols. The SOA between prime and target was 300 msec. The use of a short SOA between prime and target (300 msec) ensures to reduce the risk of semantic expectancies (i.e., creation of a mental list of potential associates). The intertrial interval (ITI) separating the single trials varied between 2000 msec and 2000 msec plus one repetition time (TR; here TR = 2.37 sec) to increase the sampling rate of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response (Josephs et al.  ). The stimuli were presented visually via projection to a mirror directly above the participant's head at eye level. The experimental procedure was programmed using the software presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems,  ). 
  
Timing (in milliseconds) used in each experimental trial of Experiment 1 (semantic categorization [SC]) and Experiment 2 (silently thinking about a word's meaning [SilTh]). 
  
Critically, Experiments 1 and 2 differed with respect to the linguistic task. However, a linguistic task involving a binary decision was used in Experiment 1 (i.e., semantic categorization), a linguistic “task” that did not require a binary decision was used in Experiment 2 (i.e., silently thinking about a word's meaning). 

#### Experiment 1: semantic categorization 
  
Participants were asked to decide whether each item presented in capital letters (i.e., the second word of each trial) was natural or manmade (i.e., semantic categorization). For the symbol pairs, participants indicated whether the series of symbols were identical or different. Participants responded using their left hand. Half of the participants (  n   = 9) used the forefinger for the response “natural” and the middle finger for the response “manmade” and the other half (  n   = 9) used the reversed pattern. The first session was preceded by a short practice session of 12 items before scanning started. Practice was repeated until participants responded without errors. 


#### Experiment 2: silently thinking about a word's meaning 
  
In the related, unrelated, neutral, and filler conditions, the trial timing was identical to the one used in Experiment 1 except for the presentation duration of the target word. The written target word was presented in capital letters for 300 msec followed by a blank screen for 1500 msec. The same timing was applied for the presentation of symbol pairs. As in Experiment 1, the prime word was replaced by a blank screen for 200 msec in the neutral and symbol trials. All other parameters (i.e., SOA, variable ITI) and the software used for stimulus presentation were equivalent to Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, inspired by Chee et al. ( ), participants were instructed to read each uppercase target-word silently and to think of its meaning (i.e., deeply process its semantic properties). Participants performed the semantic processing from the onset of the target until the next trial started. The experimental task of Experiment 2 (“silently thinking about a word's meaning”) did not require an overt behavioral decision. To ensure that participants carefully processed the critical target words, a paper–pencil postscanning recognition-test was administrated outside the scanner after the completion of the main experiment. The recognition-test was composed of 240 words. Among these words, 30 words were critical target words of the experiment (“old” target words, 1/8) whereas, the other 210 words were not (“new” target words). For each word, participants were told to indicate whether this word was presented during the experiment (“old” word) or not (“new” word). The first session was preceded by a short practice session of 12 items before scanning started. Practice was repeated once if participants did not understand the task. 

Each of the five sessions lasted for ∼10 min, with 1–2 min rest between each session. 



### Behavioral data analysis 
  
#### Experiment 1 
  
A counter module was started at the onset of the visual target presentation to register RT using presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems). We recorded both reaction times (RTs in msec) and accuracy (in %). Time-out was set at 200 msec and at 1800 msec; if the participants responded before 200 msec or after 1800 msec, the response was coded as missing. A correction procedure (mean ± 2SD) was applied on the RTs for correct responses in order to discard extreme values. RTs were then averaged in the two experimental conditions across participants and across items. Priming effects were calculated by subtracting the averaged RT in the related condition from the averaged RT in the unrelated condition by participants and by items. 


#### Experiment 2 
  
The postscanning recognition-test resulted in accuracy rates that are indicated by the percentage of hits (percentage of “old” words that were correctly recognized as “old”) and of correct rejections (percentage of “new” words that were correctly identified as “new”). We computed the mean percentage of hits and the mean percentage of correct rejections of the postscanning recognition-test per participant to gain accuracy rates. 



### fMRI acquisition and analysis 
  
All imaging data were collected with a 3.0-Tesla Magnetom TrioTim syngo MR B13 whole body system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Image acquisition consisted of a fast   T  -weighted sequence (localizer) and   T  *-weighted sequences for functional images. Functional images were acquired in 38 axial slices using a BOLD-sensitive gradient-echo echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence with an echo time (TE) of 30 msec, a flip angle of 90 degrees, a TR of 2.37 sec, and an acquisition bandwidth of 100 kHz. The matrix acquired was 64 × 64 with a field of view (FOV) of 192 mm , resulting in an in-plane resolution of 3 mm × 3 mm. Slice thickness was 3 mm without interslice gap. Each trial had a length of 2.7 sec followed by an ITI in milliseconds varying from 2000 msec to 2000 msec + 1 TR. The functional measurements were carried out in five sessions of about 10 min length. There were 96 trials per session (480 trials, in total). In each session, about 240 volumes were recorded. For each run, the functional scanning was always preceded by five dummy scans to insure tissue steady-state magnetization. After functional scanning, a high-resolution (HR) 3D   T  -weighted sequence for anatomical images was performed (12 min). HR   T   images were acquired for coregistration of the functional images (data matrix = 256 × 256, slice-thickness = 1 mm, FOV = 256 mm , TR = 2.3 sec, TE = 2.98 msec). The whole experiment lasted for about 1 h. Preprocesing of fMRI data was carried out with Statistical Parametric Mapping SPM2 (Wellcome trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK,  ). First, the functional images were checked for motion-related artifacts per participant per experimental session. The exclusion criterion was set to 3 mm deviation from the initial position of the head at the beginning of a session according to the six movement parameters. Then, all functional images were corrected for slice timing, spatially realigned, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, and smoothed using a Gaussian filter of 8 mm. A high-pass filter was used to remove low-frequency drifts. 

Random-effects analyses were conducted using SPM8 (Wellcome trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK,  ). At single-subject level, we modeled each experimental condition (related, unrelated, filler pairs, neutral, and symbol trials) as separate events using the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) supplied by SPM8 and its temporal derivative to correct for the implied impreciseness in timing, resulting in two regressors per experimental condition. The onset of the second word of each pair (i.e., the target word, or the presentation of the symbol string) was defined as the onset of the HRF used in the regressor. For Experiment 1, we added two regressors for incorrect and missed trials to explain variance introduced by error trials. Six realignment parameters (three translation, three rotation) estimated during preprocessing were added as regressors of no interest. We computed individual contrast images for the critical conditions (related, unrelated) by subtracting the activation associated with the symbol condition from the related and unrelated condition for each linguistic task, respectively. We used the symbol condition as visual baseline condition in both tasks to subtract out any activation associated with motor responses in Experiment 1 and with activation related to basic processing of visual stimuli for both linguistic tasks. Otherwise, a comparison of both linguistic tasks would have resulted in a main effect of semantic categorization in motor brain areas. 

These individual contrast estimates for the critical conditions for both linguistic tasks were subjected to a group analysis. At the group level, we ran a 2 × 2 full-factorial model with the within-subject factor Relatedness (levels: related, unrelated) and the between-subject factor Linguistic task (levels: semantic categorization, silently thinking about a word's meaning). In addition to the full-factorial model, we conducted a conjunction analysis across both linguistic tasks to examine whether both tasks recruit overlapping brain areas. For the analysis of fMRI data, the resulting statistical parameter maps were thresholded at   P   < 0.001 uncorrected. All brain areas surviving this threshold are reported in the results section. However, we restrict the discussion of data to effects found in a priori regions of interest (ROI) such as inferior and middle frontal regions, inferior parietal, middle, superior, and inferior temporal regions including the fusiform gyrus. We report the significance level at the peak level and at the cluster level corrected for multiple comparisons (family-wise error [FWE] corrected   P  -values). Only clusters of at least 25 connected voxels (i.e., 675 mm ) are reported. Given the a priori hypothesis of linguistic task effects in the LIFG, we also ran ROI analyses using small volume correction (SVC) implemented in SPM8. It is recommended to derive the location for the ROI from meta-analyses of functional imaging studies that explored the process of interest like “semantic processing” (Poldrack  ; Poldrack et al.  ). ROI analyses were performed with 15 mm spheres around the peak voxel (a) in the LIFG (MNI coordinates:   x   = −44,   y   = 24,   z   = 4, see   for location) showing activation for “semantic processing” in a meta-analysis provided by the Neurosynth database (source:  ; number of implemented studies: 60), and (b) in the LIFG (MNI coordinates:   x   = −36,   y   = 33,   z   = −12) showing linguistic task effects in the Wright et al. ( ) study. Although statistical effects drawn from ROI analyses should be corrected for multiple comparisons (cf., Poldrack  ), we used liberal significance thresholds of   P   < 0.005 (uncorrected) with at least five connected voxels to avoid Type-II errors (cf., Lieberman and Cunningham  ). 

For labeling of brain regions, we transformed MNI-coordinates to the Talairach space and used the “Talairach Daemon Client” (Lancaster et al.  ,  ). All coordinates were reported in MNI space in the results section. 



## Results 
  
### Experiment 1 
  
#### Behavioral data obtained in the MRI scanner 
  
##### Reaction times 
  
The mean RTs averaged across participants and items and the standard errors of the mean (SEM) are displayed in Table  . We subjected the correct RTs to an omnibus test consisting of a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by participants (  F  1) and by items (  F  2) in which Relatedness (2 levels: related, unrelated) was considered as a within-subjects factor and in which List (4 levels: list 1, list 2, list 3, list 4) was considered as between-subject factor. The factor List was introduced merely to extract any variance due to the counterbalancing of critical items. A significance level of   α   = 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. The lack of any interaction with List (  Fs   < 1) indicates that the counterbalancing of items in the four experimental lists did not introduce variance in the results. Therefore, all further tests were performed on data collapsed across list. We then submitted the correct behavioral RTs to one-way ANOVAs with the within-subject factor Relatedness. The main effect of Relatedness was significant for participants (  F1   = 4.43,   P   = 0.5, mean square error = 1850.1), indicating that the averaged correct response times were significantly faster for the related (813 msec, SEM = 25) than for the unrelated (843 msec, SEM = 29) condition. In contrast, the main effect Relatedness was not significant for items (  F  2 < 1). 
  
Reaction times to correctly answered trials 
    
We included the neutral condition into the experimental design to control for inhibition effects. Behavioral analyses of RTs of the related, unrelated, and neutral condition showed that we observed facilitation but not inhibition effects. Two-tailed paired   t  -tests revealed that the mean RT of the neutral condition (894 msec [SEM: 21 msec]) was significantly longer than the mean RTs of the related (  t   = 5.337,   P   < 0.001) and the unrelated conditions (  t   = 3.082,   P   < 0.001). 


##### Accuracy 
  
The error data (in %) are presented in Table  . Relatedness had no effect on errors   (   Fs   < 1). 
  
Task accuracy: percentages of error 
    



### Experiment 2 
  
#### Behavioral data obtained postscanning outside the MRI scanner 
  
We assessed accuracy rates for hits (old words correctly identified as “old”) and correct rejections (new words correctly classified as “new”). The mean accuracy rates were 80% (SEM = 3%) for hits and 90% (SEM = 2%) for correct rejections. A significant positive correlation between hits and correct rejections (  r   = 0.56) was found. This correlation indicates that participants showing a high accuracy rate for hits, showed as well a high accuracy rate for correct rejections. 


#### Imaging data 
  
All results of the 2 × 2 full-factorial ANOVA and the conjunction analysis are based on whole-brain analyses surviving a significance threshold of   P   < 0.001 and represent clusters of at least 25 connected voxels. The 2 × 2 full-factorial ANOVA with the within-subject factor Relatedness and the between-subject factor Linguistic task revealed neural associative priming effects and Relatedness × Linguistic task interactions. Comparing neural activity with respect to the factor Linguistic task, no differences were apparent at a significance threshold of   P   < 0.001. The conjunction analysis revealed that semantic categorization and silently thinking about a word's meaning activated an overlapping left-lateralized network of infero-temporal and inferior frontal brain areas. 

##### Neural associative priming 
  
In order to investigate which brain areas show neural associative priming effects independently of the factor Linguistic task, we contrasted the hemodynamic response of the unrelated with the related condition. Contrasts were assessed according to suppression of neural activity (activation of related trials < activation of unrelated trials) and to enhancement of neural activity (activation of related trials > activation of unrelated trials). We showed associative suppression effects in bilateral STG, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in occipito-temporal brain areas such as the lingual and the parahiccocampal gyrus and in medial frontal brain areas (BA 6/BA 9). All brain regions showing neural associative priming effects are presented in Table  . Brain areas belonging to a priori ROIs; that is, brain regions usually involved during semantic processing as highlighted in the Introduction section (i.e., inferior and middle frontal regions, inferior parietal, middle, superior, and inferior temporal regions including the fusiform gyrus in both hemispheres) are marked in bold face. Brain areas showing neural associative suppression effects are shown in Figure  . Additionally, we present the mean contrast estimates for related compared to unrelated trials for the neural associative priming effects in the left and right STG. No associative enhancement effects were observed. A comparison of related and unrelated trials with the neutral condition was carried out to exclude that our data were affected by inhibition effects. Consistent with the behavioral data of Experiment 1, no inhibition effects (unrelated > neutral) were observed in relevant brain areas for semantic processing ( ).

Mean contrast estimates (% signal change) for related (RL) compared to unrelated (UL) trials across participants are shown for the left and right superior temporal gyri (STG) for both tasks (semantic categorization [SC], silently thinking about a word's meaning [SilTh]). Error bars indicate the SEM. 
  

##### Linguistic task effects 
  
No linguistic task effects could be observed in prefrontal brain areas. ROI analyses in the LIFG (a) active during semantic processing in a meta-analysis ( ; MNI coordinates:   x   = −44,   y   = 24,   z   = 4), and (b) showing a linguistic task effect in the Wright et al. ( ) study (MNI coordinates: −36, 33, −12) did not reveal task-specific activation, even at liberal significance thresholds of   P   < 0.005 (uncorrected). Consistently, no brain region was more active for semantic categorization compared to silently thinking about a word's meaning at the specified threshold of   P   < 0.001 (uncorrected) in the full-factorial ANOVA. In contrast, higher activation was observed in occipital and inferior parietal brain areas for silently thinking compared to semantic categorization (see Table   section B) at   P   < 0.001 (uncorrected). Note that the individual contrast estimates for the critical conditions subjected to group-level analysis were subtracted from the symbol condition, the visual, and in the case of semantic categorization, the motor response baseline condition.

##### Relatedness × Linguistic task interaction 
  
We evaluated the Relatedness × Linguistic task interaction by contrasting neural associative priming effects for semantic categorization with silently thinking about a word's meaning (i.e., Associative Suppression – semantic categorization > Associative Suppression – silently thinking about a word's meaning and vice versa). Relatedness × Linguistic task interactions were revealed in the right (R) IFG and the cingulate gyrus (see, Table   section C). This effect was significant at the specified threshold of   P   < 0.001 uncorrected, but not at a significance level corrected for multiple comparisons at peak or cluster level. The Relatedness × Linguistic task interaction in the RIFG and its mean contrast estimates are displayed in Figure  .

Mean contrast estimates (%) for related (RL) and unrelated (UL) trials across participants for semantic categorization (SC) and silently thinking about a word's meaning (SilTh) are displayed. Error bars indicate SEM. 
  

##### Conjunction analysis 
  
In addition to the 2 × 2 full-factorial ANOVA, we computed a conjunction analysis across both tasks independently of the factor Relatedness. The conjunction analysis revealed overlapping task activation in a left-lateralized network consisting of occipito-temporal brain areas including the fusiform gyrus and inferior and middle frontal brain areas (Fig.  ). All the brain areas showing overlapping activation for semantic categorization and silently thinking about a word's meaning are reported in section A of Table  . In addition, we report the task activation ([Related + Unrelated] – Symbol) for semantic categorization and silently thinking about a word's meaning separately in sections B and C of Table  .

## Discussion 
  
In the present study, we investigated whether the neuroanatomical localization of neural associative priming effects within a fronto-parieto-temporal network thought to subserve semantic processing (for a review, see Price  ; Bookheimer  ; Wu et al.  ) differed with respect to the presence of a binary semantic decision process. In particular, we focused on the functional role of the LIFG in semantic decision making. Linguistic task demands were systematically manipulated with respect to a binary semantic decision process in two associative priming experiments designed to elicit automatic lexical processing by controlling the SOA and PRP (cf., De Groot  ; Balota and Lorch  ; Neely  ; McNamara and Holbrook  ). 

Our results provide a clear picture: the two semantic tasks activated the same left-lateralized fronto-temporal network, recruiting the fusiform gyrus, the cingulate cortex, the IFG, and MFG, irrespective of the presence of a binary decision component. No linguistic task effects could be observed in the LIFG. However, silently thinking about a word's meaning showed higher activation in inferior parietal brain areas compared to semantic categorization, but no brain area was more active for semantic categorization. Regarding associative priming effects, we found neural associative suppression effects in bilateral superior temporal brain areas, occipito-temporal, and medial frontal brain regions independently of the linguistic task. However, one brain area seemed to be selectively activated as a function of the binary decision process, namely the right IFG. At the behavioral level for semantic categorization, there was a significant 30-msec associative priming effect indicating that lexical access was facilitated (cf., Meyer and Schvaneveldt  ). No inhibition effects were observed as expected for experimental paradigms with short SOAs and low PRPs (cf., Neely  ). For silently thinking about a word's meaning, we observed high accuracy rates in the postscanning recognition-test with a significant positive correlation between hits and correct rejections emphasizing that participants did well process the critical words. 

### Neural associative suppression effects 
  
Observation of neural associative suppression effects in a fronto-temporal network across both tasks indicates that semantic processing was facilitated for related compared to unrelated word pairs (Copland et al.  ; Wheatley et al.  ; Gold et al.  ). In the present research, the neuroanatomical activation pattern of associative suppression effects in frontal and temporal brain areas is in line with the assumption that semantic processing necessitates that prefrontal brain regions interact with temporal brain regions (cf., Roskies et al.  ). We propose that the neural associative suppression effect in the STG and MTG likely reflects facilitated lexical access of the second word of an associatively related word pair at the level of the mental lexicon (cf., Howard et al.  ; Fiebach et al.  ). Temporal brain areas are discussed as being involved in accessing, selecting, gating, or retrieving semantic information stored in lexical entries of the mental lexicon (Roskies et al.  ). Furthermore, the neural associative suppression effect observed in medial frontal brain areas (BA 6/BA 9) might reflect facilitated integration, control, and retrieval processes of semantic information that is necessary to activate semantic representations in the related compared to the unrelated condition. Activation of anterior prefrontal areas has previously been associated with integration of verbal information and control processes (e.g., Christoff and Gabrieli  ; Prabhakaran et al.  ), management of multiple task-relevant goals (e.g., Koechlin et al.  ), and memory retrieval processes (Tulving et al.  ; Schacter et al.  ; Lepage et al.  ; McDermott et al.  ). Regarding neural associative suppression in the ACC, we suggest that this effect might be related to the conflict arising in the unrelated critical condition compared to no conflict in the related condition. It is well known that the ACC is activated in conflicting situations (e.g., Botvinick et al.  ,  ; Kerns et al.  ). Thus, this effect is mainly related to nonlexical processes that are induced by the associative priming paradigm underlining that the paradigm worked very well. 


### Linguistic task effects 
  
Linguistic task effects were found in inferior parietal regions with higher activation for silently thinking about a word's meaning compared to semantic decision making. We suggest that this difference might be due to the fact that silently thinking about a word's meaning led to a deeper analysis of semantic content like previously observed for explicit semantic tasks (cf., Kuperberg et al.  ; Ruff et al.  ). No brain area was more active for semantic decision making. In contrast to Wright et al. ( ), who showed linguistic task effects with respect to binary decision making (LDT vs. Passive listening) in the LIFG, we showed overlapping activation in occipito-temporal and inferior and middle frontal regions irrespective of the binary decision. This finding suggests that the whole fronto-temporal network including the LIFG is important for activating semantic content in general irrespective of linguistic task demands. In our study, activation of the LIFG with a task that did not involve a binary decision might be explained by the fact that a “deep” semantic analysis was conducted. This could be due to the fact that we combined a paradigm favoring activation of the semantic representation of words, that is, associative priming, with a task that explicitly led the participants to deeply process the semantic properties of the words, that is, silently thinking about a word's meaning (cf., Ruff et al.  ). Our findings are consistent with previous lexical priming studies (semantic/repetition) showing neural responses related to lexical/semantic processing in the LIFG (Chee et al.  ; Wheatley et al.  ) with linguistic tasks that did not involve an overt behavioral response (silently activating the meaning of words/silent reading). Activation of the LIFG irrespective of linguistic task demands converges also with a previous study of Ruff et al. ( ), who failed to show a linguistic task effect (LDT vs. Semantic judgment) in the LIFG indicating that the LIFG is active independently of the explicit or implicit nature of a linguistic task. 

This is the first study that directly compared the neural response related to semantic processing in two semantic tasks, which differed with respect to semantic decision making, assessed with a linguistic paradigm tapping into automatic lexical access. Unlike in previous studies, we are convinced that the participants analyzed the semantic properties of the target words in depths in both tasks underpinned (1) by associative suppression effects in brain areas typically active during semantic processing as the STG, (2) by behavioral associative priming effects for semantic categorization, and (3) by high-accuracy rates in a postscanning recognition-test for silently thinking about a word's meaning. Altogether, our experimental choices may have contributed to be able to capture activation in the LIFG and temporal brain areas with the two linguistic tasks. 

Moreover, we found a Task × Relatedness interaction in the RIFG with associative suppression for semantic categorization but not for silently thinking about a word's meaning. This interaction may be related to decision making per se, independently of activating semantic content, which would be consistent with the general role of prefrontal brain areas in decision making. However, this effect was significant at the specified significance threshold, but not after correction for multiple comparisons. Conservative significance testing in fMRI analyses has been discussed as possibly increasing the risk of committing Type-II errors compared to Type-I errors in statistical inference (Lieberman and Cunningham  ). Thus, we suggest that the effect in the RIFG with a large cluster size of 40 voxels and a   t  -value of 4.22 is unlikely to represent a false positive. Further investigation should be conducted to disentangle the functional role of the left and right IFG in semantic processing. 



## Conclusion 
  
Left-lateralized activation of temporal and inferior frontal brain areas irrespective of linguistic task demands call into question the role of the LIFG as center of semantic decision making (cf., Demb et al.  ; Fiez  ; Gabrieli et al.  ; Wagner et al.  ; Roskies et al.  ; Wu et al.  ). The present fMRI data lend support to the claim that the LIFG is involved in semantic content activation in general and not especially involved during semantic decision making. In contrast, the right IFG may play a role in decision making independently of semantic processing. Further investigation would be necessary to investigate the temporal structure of the involvement of the different parts of the fronto-temporal network involved during lexical access depending on the task demands. For this purpose, combined neurophysiological and neuroimaging methods will be fruitful to precise the neurodynamics of activation within this cortical network.

# Abstract
 
Recent studies indicate that the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is active not only when touch is physically perceived but also when it is merely observed to be experienced by another person. This social responsivity of S1 has important implications for our understanding of S1 functioning. However, S1 activity during touch observation has not been characterized in great detail to date. We focused on two features of the S1 functional architecture during touch observation, namely the topographical arrangement of index and middle finger receptive fields (RFs), and their dynamic shrinkage during concurrent activation. Both features have important implications for human behavior. We conducted two fMRI studies at 7 T, one where touch was physically perceived, and one where touch was observed. In the two experiments, participants either had their index finger and/or middle finger stimulated using paintbrushes, or just observed similar touch events on video. Our data show that observing and physically experiencing touch elicits overlapping activity changes in S1. In addition, observing touch to the index finger or the middle finger alone evoked topographically arranged activation foci in S1. Importantly, when co-activated, the index and middle finger RFs not only shrank during physical touch perception, but also during touch observation. Our data, therefore, indicate a similarity between the functional architecture of S1 during touch observation and physical touch perception with respect to single-digit topography and RF shrinkage. These results may allow the tentative conclusion that even primary somatosensory experiences, such as physical touch perception, can be shared amongst individuals.

## Introduction 
  
In recent years, the unisensory and private character of many primary sensory brain areas has increasingly been questioned. Traditionally, primary sensory brain areas, such as the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), have been assumed to be unisensory in character, and to only respond to modality-specific input; however, recent research has provided evidence for their multisensory response properties (Kayser  ). The responsivity of primary sensory brain areas to multimodal input has even been called a “revolution in multisensory research” (Driver and Noesselt  ), and S1 seems to be part of it. An increasing amount of evidence shows that S1 activity is not only influenced by direct somatosensory input, but is also modulated by other factors such as attention (Eimer et al.  ; Hsiao et al.  ; Macaluso et al.  ), reward (Pleger et al.  ), spatial processing (Eimer et al.  ), or visual stimulation (Dionne et al.  ; Zhou and Fuster  ). As a consequence, the emerging view in cognitive neuroscience is that S1 can no longer be regarded as a strictly unisensory brain area, but rather as an area whose activity levels can be shaped by multiple environmental inputs. 

Yet another quantum leap for our understanding of S1 is that recent studies have shown a specific influence of social cues on its functioning. Not only has evidence been provided that viewing the body compared with viewing an object can influence S1 processing during physical touch perception (Cardini et al.  ; Fiorio and Haggard  ; Longo et al.  ), but it has also been shown that viewing touch to a body, without physically perceiving touch at all, can increase S1 activity levels (Blakemore et al.  ; Ebisch et al.  ; Kuehn et al.  ; Schaefer et al.  ,  ). S1 activity changes during touch observation were shown to be stronger when human touch compared with object touch was observed (Blakemore et al.  ), and a specifically   social responsivity   of S1 during touch observation has been assumed (Kuehn et al.  ; Rossetti et al.  ). 

Importantly, active voxels in S1 that were triggered by touch observation were shown to overlap with voxels activated during physical touch perception (Blakemore et al.  ; Ebisch et al.  ; Schaefer et al.  ). For example, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Blakemore and colleagues showed that somatotopically specific areas in S1 were activated when touch to another person’s face and neck was observed and that such activity changes overlapped with those areas that were activated during the physical perception of touch to the subject’s own neck and face (Blakemore et al.  ). This is similar to the neuronal “resonance” responses reported for the motor system (Buccino et al.  ; Gazzola and Keysers  ; Mukamel et al.  ), and the emotional system (Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al.  ; Singer et al.  ), where similar areas in the brain were shown to activate during action observation and execution, and emotion observation and perception, respectively. It is assumed that such resonance responses allow a basic understanding of the observed action or emotion, respectively (Bernhardt and Singer  ; Fabbri-Destro and Rizzolatti  ). According to this logic, S1 activity during touch observation should allow a basic understanding of another person’s somatosensory experiences as has recently been proposed (Avenanti et al.  ; Keysers et al.  ). 

An interesting resulting question is how activity changes in S1 during touch observation can be characterized. Which features of the   functional architecture   of S1 are shared between physically perceiving and observing touch, and which only occur in one or the other condition? Based on recent neuroimaging research on the human somatosensory system, two features of the functional architecture of S1 seem to be of specific importance in this respect. On the one hand, the   topographical arrangement   of cortical receptive fields (RFs) in S1 plays an important role in our understanding of somatosensory processing. S1 activity during physical touch perception represents the contralateral side of the human body in a mediolateral sequence (Blankenburg et al.  ; Gardner EK  ; Kaas et al.  ; Krause et al.  ), and has been shown to make an important contribution to the ability to localize tactile stimuli on the skin (Beauchamp et al.  ; Chen et al.  ,  ; Schweizer et al.  ). Changes in the topographical arrangement of single-digit RFs in S1 can, for example, lead to a diminished ability to assign touch to a particular digit (Braun et al.  ; Schweizer et al.  ). 

On the other hand,   suppressive interactions   between coactivated RFs in S1 have often been used to describe the functional architecture of S1. RFs in S1 react within milliseconds to sensory inputs given to surrounding RFs. For instance, the RF of one digit contracts when other digits are stimulated simultaneously and rapidly expands again when the digit is stimulated alone. This shrinking and re-enlarging of S1 RFs, depending on the tactile input given to surrounding RFs, has been demonstrated in studies on cats, mice, and monkeys (Friedman et al.  ; Moore et al.  ; Zarzecki and Wiggin  ), and is posited to reflect a wide-spread cortical mechanism, which results in increased perceived stimulus contrast (Dykes  ; Falkner et al.  ; Jones  ; Moore et al.  ). Suppressive interactions during physical touch perception have also been investigated in multiple human studies (Biermann et al.  ; Braun et al.  ; Gandevia et al.  ; Haavik Taylor and Murphy  ; Hoechstetter et al.  ; Ishibashi et al.  ; Naka et al.  ; Ruben et al.  ; Tanosaki et al.  ; Torquati et al.  ), where the arithmetic sum of S1 signals measured during separate single-digit stimulations of two fingers was compared with the signal change during the stimulation of both fingers at once. In these studies, decreased signal strength during double-digit stimulation, compared with the sum of signals from separate single-digit stimulations, indicated how much the RFs contracted. Also in humans, such RF shrinkages presumably mediated by suppressive interactions, are assumed to positively relate to perceived stimulus contrast (Braun et al.  ; Cardini et al.  ; Puts et al.  ). 

Given that the aim of the present study was to characterize the functional architecture of S1 during touch observation along these two dimensions (topographical arrangement of RFs and suppressive interactions between RFs), the use of standard 3 Tesla (T) fMRI designs would have limited the scope of this approach. On the one hand, S1 activity during touch observation has been shown to be subtle, often only to survive significance thresholds when small volume corrections are applied to the fMRI data (Blakemore et al.  ; Fitzgibbon et al.  ; Keysers et al.  ; Schaefer et al.  ). This low signal strength clearly limits the possibility to characterize suppressive interactions, because subtle activity differences between different experimental conditions are of primary interest here. On the other hand, the spatial resolution of the functional data in 3 T fMRI studies is often too low to describe fine-grained architectonic characteristics in sufficient detail, for instance when specifying the topography of RFs in S1. In both cases, fMRI at ultra-high field offers a promising approach to circumvent some of these limitations (Chen et al.  ; Kuehn et al.  ; Stringer et al.  ). As has recently been argued in a similar context (Kuehn et al.  ; Stringer et al.  ), 7 T fMRI can characterize brain activity changes in greater spatial detail, and with far greater sensitivity than is available with standard designs at 3 T (Bandettini  ; Gati et al.  ; Heidemann et al.  ; Sanchez-Panchuelo et al.  ; Scouten et al.  ). 

One recent study used 7 T fMRI to characterize S1 activity during touch observation (Kuehn et al.  ). It was found that S1 activity during touch observation was restricted to posterior parts of contralateral S1; anterior parts were spared. This suggests that anterior S1 may still be considered a primary (and private) sensory brain area that is involved in social cognitive processes to a lesser extent, whereas somatosensory processes that are mediated by posterior S1 can be shared between, and are therefore influenced by, social interaction partners. However, that study did not characterize the functional architecture of activity changes in S1; it focused on the main effect of touch observation elicited by observing touch to one part of the hand. In order to characterize the topography of S1 activity during touch observation, one would have to let participants observe touch to different parts of the hands, such as different digits, and see whether distinct and topographically arranged activity changes in S1 were evoked. In addition, in order to characterize whether touch observation leads to similar inhibitory interactions between adjacent RFs, such as during physical touch perception (Gardner and Costanzo  ; DiCarlo et al.  ; DiCarlo and Johnson  ; Friedman et al.  ), one would have to compare the signal strength between conditions where touch to one finger is observed and conditions where touch to two fingers is observed, as is classically done in paradigms on suppressive interactions (Gandevia et al.  ; Ruben et al.  ). 

For such an approach to be successful, it is important to know that single digits are distinctly represented not only in anterior S1, but also in posterior S1 (Duncan and Boynton  ; Stringer et al.  ; Sutherling et al.  ), the area where touch observation elicits higher activity changes (Kuehn et al.  ). More precisely, the RF of the index finger in posterior S1 is more lateral, more anterior, and more inferior than the RF of the middle finger of the same hand (Nelson and Chen  ). A second important prerequisite for this approach is that, in principle, it has to be possible to characterize RF interactions by means of fMRI. Whereas many human studies have used EEG or MEG to characterize suppressive interactions between adjacently activated RFs in S1 (e.g., Biermann et al.  ; Gandevia et al.  ), one study with human participants successfully used fMRI for this purpose (Ruben et al.  ). Importantly, fMRI was able to show that suppressive interactions between adjacently activated RFs in S1 occur not only in anterior but also in posterior parts of S1. 

In the present study, we used fMRI at 7 T to characterize the functional architecture of S1 during touch observation along two dimensions: topographical arrangement of RFs and suppressive interactions between adjacent RFs. During the scanning session, participants observed video clips where touch was applied either to the index finger alone, the middle finger alone, or both the index and middle finger together using paintbrushes. While observing the videos, participants had to decide which of two subsequently presented paintbrushes offered the rougher stroke. This secondary task was included because the shrinkage of adjacent RFs during their concurrent activation is assumed to relate to more precise stimulus perception (Braun et al.  ; Cardini et al.  ; Puts et al.  ), which we hypothesized could also transfer to the situation of touch observation. In this experiment (hereafter referred to as the observed touch experiment), no physical touch was applied to the participant’s hands or fingers. Based on previous findings (Kuehn et al.  ), we expected that particularly posterior areas of contralateral S1 would show increased activity levels when touch videos were observed. Importantly, we further expected that activity foci during observed touch to the index finger alone and middle finger alone would be partly distinct and somatotopically ordered in accordance with the expected S1 functional topography. We also expected that observing touch to the middle finger and to the index finger together would decrease activity levels in S1 compared with observing touch to the same fingers alone. Such a reduction could likely be explained by suppressive interactions between adjacently activated RFs. 

As a control experiment (hereafter referred to as the physical touch experiment), we performed another 7 T fMRI experiment where physical tactile stimulation was applied to participants’ index and middle fingers using paintbrushes in the same way as was observed in the observed touch experiment—the index finger alone, the middle finger alone, or both the index and middle fingers together. We expected the same pattern of results for this experiment, i.e., greater activity changes for physical touch perception compared with rest, partly distinct representations of the index and middle finger RFs in posterior S1, and suppressive interactions between index and middle finger RFs. In the conjunction analysis between both experiments, we expected an overlap between activity changes during physical touch perception and touch observation. 

In summary, we intended to produce the first characterization of the functional architecture of S1 during touch observation, and relate the results to the well-described functional architecture of S1 during physical touch perception. Given the novelty of this experimental approach, our results should make an important contribution to understanding the role of S1 in social cognition. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Experimental design 
  
We conducted two separate fMRI experiments using a 7 T MR scanner, where participants either physically perceived tactile stimulation on their finger(s), or merely observed similar events on video. In the physical touch experiment, tactile stimulation was applied to participants’ index and/or middle finger using paintbrushes. In the observed touch experiment, videos were presented to participants showing touch to the corresponding fingers, again applied using paintbrushes. The observed touch experiment was always conducted first to exclude any influence of touch experience in the scanner on touch observation (Gazzola and Keysers  ). Both experiments were separated by 6–7 days (mean: 6.5 days ± 1.1 days [SD]). 


### Participants 
  
Sixteen healthy volunteers between 22 and 30 years (mean age 25.6 years, 8 females) participated in our study. All were right-handed (mean handedness score on the Edinburgh inventory: 98.1; Oldfield  ), had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and none reported history of neurological, major medical, or psychiatric disorders. They were paid for their attendance and informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the local Ethics committee at the University of Leipzig. One participant was excluded from further analyses due to a high number of missed trials (9.4 %) and a reported failure to stay awake throughout the experiment. The functional and behavioral analyses were therefore conducted with data from 15 participants. 


### Physical touch experiment 
  
While subjects underwent fMRI scanning, physical tactile stimulation was applied via paintbrushes, either to the participants’ middle finger (MF) or index finger (IF), or simultaneously to both the middle and index fingers (both fingers = BF) of their right hands. In this way, the RF topography during physical touch perception could be described and later be compared to the RF topography during observation of touch to the corresponding fingers. In addition, added S1 activity changes during single-finger stimulation could later be compared with S1 activity changes during double-finger stimulation, as a measure of suppressive interactions (Gandevia et al.  ; Ruben et al.  ). 

In the scanner, participants had their right hands fixed on a plastic board placed on the abdomen. The two paintbrushes used for tactile stimulation were mounted on two sticks that were connected to the plastic board to hold them at an optimal and fixed angle towards the fingers. To apply tactile stimulation, the two sticks were manually moved back and forth by the experimenter, who sat next to the scanner. Prior to the actual study, the experimenter was given intensive training in applying touch with constant pressure and with as little resultant movement as possible. Stimulation blocks lasted 24 s, consisted of four upward and four downward strokes (3 s per stroke), and were always followed by a 24 s rest period. In each run, the three stimulation blocks (IF, MF, BF) were repeated three times in a randomized sequence. The experiment consisted of four runs. Thus, each stimulation block was repeated 12 times throughout the experiment, which lasted about 30 min in total. Participants were instructed to close their eyes and to completely relax their hands and fingers throughout the scanning session. Trial order and temporal sequence of stimulation blocks were indicated to the experimenter via earphones. 


### Observed touch experiment 
  
During touch observation, participants in the scanner observed short video clips (6 s in duration) showing human right hands being touched by different paintbrushes. While watching the videos, no physical tactile stimulation was applied to the participants’ fingers. In the videos, analogous to the physical touch experiment, either the IF, MF, or BF of the right hand were stroked by one or two paintbrushes, respectively. When only one finger was stroked, the other paintbrush stroked the tabletop next to the hand. We also included a no-touch (control) condition, where both paintbrushes stroked the tabletop, while the hand was still visible. In half of the videos, participants saw their own hand from the first person perspective; in the other half they saw another person’s hand from the third person perspective. In this way, half of the observed touch and no-touch videos were related to the self, whereas the other half were clearly assigned to another person. Overall, this resulted in eight experimental conditions (observed touch IF/observed touch MF/observed touch BF/no-touch × self-related/other-related observed touch, see Fig.  b). Throughout the experiment, each condition was repeated 12 times.   
Design and example trial of the observed touch experiment.   a   Example trial as shown to participants in the scanner. Each trial started with the same question (“Which paintbrush is rougher?”) followed by two video clips presented in direct succession that belonged to the same experimental condition, but showed two different paintbrush pairs for tactile stimulation; while seeing a question mark on the screen, participants then had to indicate via left-hand button-presses which of the two paintbrush pairs was rougher. Half of the participants responded with their left index finger when they thought the first paintbrush pair was rougher and with their left middle finger when they thought the second was rougher, the other half responded vice versa; the pause between two trials was 6 s in two-thirds of the trials and 20 s in one-third of the trials, and this was counterbalanced across conditions.   b   Participants saw either their own hand in the first person perspective or another person’s hand in the third person perspective on video; in the observed touch conditions, touch was applied to either the middle finger (MF), the index finger (IF), or to both fingers (BF) of the right hand; in the no-touch condition, the paintbrush pair stroked the white surface on which the hand was positioned 
  

In each trial, two brief video clips were presented in direct succession that both belonged to the same experimental condition. In both clips, the paintbrushes shown differed in their roughness levels. After watching both video clips, participants had to indicate via left hand button presses whether they thought that the first or the second video displayed the rougher paintbrushes (see Fig.  a for an example trial). A correct response could be given in each trial (see “ ” for details). This secondary task was conducted to ensure constant attention during the experiment and to estimate how well participants could judge the sensory experience related to paintbrush strokes by sight. 


### Design 
  
The entire experiment took approximately 47 min in total and consisted of 96 trials. Half of the trials in each experimental condition showed the rougher paintbrushes first, the other half showed the smoother paintbrushes first. Trials were pseudo-randomly presented with the constraint that none of the experimental conditions was repeated more than twice in a row, and in such a way that trials in each condition added up to the same relative time point within the experiment. Prior to scanning, participants were allowed to practice the task in four trials outside the scanner room. The experimenter ensured that they understood the task well, and were familiar with the response mode prior to entering the scanner room. 


### Stimuli 
  
The video clips were recorded several weeks prior to scanning, with the same participants who later took part in the fMRI studies. During the video recordings, participants placed their right hand comfortably on a white table. Their right arm passed through a hole in a paper wall mounted in front of the table, so that they could not see their hand, the paintbrushes, or the experimenter throughout the video recordings. Their right hand was positioned such that their fingers did not touch each other but were also not stretched too far apart, and they were told to completely relax their right hand and fingers for the recording. For tactile stimulation, the experimenter used five different identical-looking paintbrushes [DaVinci paintbrushes, series 5025 (1), 5073 (2), 5036 (3), 5040 (4), and 5076 (5)]. Tactile stimulation was applied for 6 s, either to the participants’ right MF, IF or BF. In all conditions, two paintbrushes moved in parallel following a fixed temporal sequence that was indicated to the experimenter by an auditory signal (3 s per stroke, two strokes in total). All videos were recorded at a constant illumination level and with a constant angle and height between the video camera and the hands. During the video session, participants were blind with respect to the purpose of the video recordings, and they were not told how many or which kind of paintbrushes were used for stimulation. 

During the fMRI experiment, the following paintbrush pairs were compared in the two videos of one trial: (1) versus (4), (2) versus (5), (1) versus (2), and (3) versus (5). Paintbrushes with higher numbers had softer and more flexible brushes and thus a smoother stroke than those with lower numbers. This was tested in a behavioral pre-experiment with an independent group of 9 participants. Roughness levels of all the paintbrush pairs used could be correctly distinguished well above chance (see Online Resource 1 for more information on this experiment). As a criterion to define self/other hand pairs, we matched the self-related and other-related hands for each participant in terms of gender, and chose partners with a similar hand shape index [i.e., ratio of width to length of hand (Longo and Haggard  ); mean hand shape difference between self/other-pairs in our study: 4.4 %]. Importantly, once a self/other hand pair was identified, the videos that served as the self conditions for one partner always served as the other conditions for the matching partner. In this way, self/other differences in the video clips that could not be explicitly controlled (for example differences in skin color) were counterbalanced across participants. 


### Imaging acquisition parameters 
  
Functional and structural MRI data were acquired using a 7 T MR scanner (Magnetom 7T, Siemens Healthcare Sector, Erlangen, Germany) with a 24-channel NOVA head coil. Prior to both experiments, high-resolution 3D anatomical T1-weighted scans were acquired. For the observed touch experiment, which was always conducted first, structural data were acquired using the MP2RAGE sequence with the following parameters: TR = 5.0 s, TE = 2.45 ms, TI1/TI2 = 900 ms/2,750 ms, flip angle 1/flip angle 2 = 5°/3° with an isotropic voxel resolution of 0.7 mm (Marques et al.  ). For the physical touch experiment, we used a shorter T1-sequence with a slightly reduced spatial resolution, because the T1-images acquired for each participant during the observed touch experiment could later be used for data analyses; the MP2RAGE sequence here served only to anatomically localize S1 in the subsequently measured functional scans. Acquisition parameters in the physical touch experiment were: TR = 4.0 s, TE = 2.36 ms, TI1/TI2 = 900 ms/2,750 ms, flip angle 1/flip angle 2 = 5°/3° with an isotropic voxel resolution of 0.9 mm. Shimming was performed in both experiments prior to collecting the functional data. In both experiments, T1-weighted scans were subsequently used to select 30 axial slices (interleaved slice acquisition, slice thickness = 1.5 mm, no gap) covering bilateral S1 and adjacent areas (see Fig.  ). The hand knob area was used for this purpose. This is easily identified in sagittal T1-images, and reliably indicates the location of the hand area in the primary motor cortex (Yousry et al.  ), and the primary somatosensory cortex (Moore et al.  ; Sastre-Janer et al.  ; White et al.  ). Functional T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar images were then acquired using GRAPPA acceleration (iPAT = 3; Griswold et al.  ). A field of view of 192 × 192 mm  and an imaging matrix of 128 × 128 were used. The functional images had isotropic 1.5 mm voxels. The other sequence parameters were: TR = 1.5 s, TE = 20 ms, flip angle = 90°. The acquisition parameters of the functional scans were identical for the physical and observed touch experiments.   
Selected slices for functional imaging of one example subject. Shown is a sagittal slice of the anatomical MP2RAGE scan which was used to select 30 axial slices covering bilateral S1 on the basis of the individual subject’s brain anatomy (i.e., hand knob area) 
  

To attenuate scanner noise, participants were provided with earplugs and ear-defenders. During the observed touch experiment, the middle and index fingers of participants’ left hands were placed on two buttons of a response box. Visual stimuli were projected onto a plastic screen vertically mounted in front of the participants, which could be looked at via a mirror mounted on the receiver coil. 


### fMRI preprocessing and localization of S1 activity 
  
Preprocessing and statistical analyses of the functional imaging data were carried out using SPM8 (Statistic Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, London, UK). A slice timing correction was applied to correct for differences in image acquisition time between slices, and realignment was performed to minimize movement artifacts in the time series (Unser et al.  ,  ). Normalization to standard MNI space was done using the unified segmentation approach based on image registration and tissue classification (Ashburner and Friston  ). The high-resolution T1-weighted images of both sessions were used to visually confirm correct registration between the sessions. In addition, the co-registration of each participant within the experiments was visually checked in order to identify possible spatial distortion effects that may occur at higher field strength (none were found, however). Data were filtered with a high-pass filter of 0.01 Hz to eliminate slow signal drifts. Data were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 4 mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM). 

S1 is not a homogenous area, but can be classified into four sub-areas (from rostral to caudal: areas 3a, 3b, 1 and 2). The Anatomy Toolbox implemented in SPM8 (Eickhoff et al.  ,  ,  ; Geyer et al.  ,  ; Grefkes et al.  ) was used to specify in which sub-area activity changes took place for the normalized group-level and single-subject analyses. Single-subject analyses were additionally performed without normalization into stereotactic space in order to describe the site of the suppressive interaction effect as precisely as possible in relation to the cortical anatomy of each individual subject. We used guidelines that linked cytoarchitectonic labeling with anatomical descriptions of subregions (Geyer et al.  ,  ; Grefkes et al.  ; White et al.  ). According to these specifications, areas 3a and 3b (anterior S1) are found in the deep valley of the central sulcus and in the anterior wall of the postcentral gyrus, respectively, whereas areas 1 and 2 (posterior S1) are located at the crown of the postcentral gyrus and at the posterior wall of the postcentral gyrus, respectively. It is important to note that although these specifications are useful, no clear anatomical landmark exists for the exact transition zone between S1 subregions (Geyer et al.  ). However, using a combination of automated and manual labeling, and by including single-subject analyses, the localization of the suppressive interaction effect in S1 in the current study is described in reasonable detail. 


### fMRI statistical analyses 
  
A general linear model (GLM) was fitted to the data and   t  -maps were created on the individual subject level. In the observed touch experiment, the observation times of the two video sequences in each trial were modeled as blocks and used to compute contrast images by linear combination of parameter estimates. In the physical touch experiment, the physical tactile stimulation blocks were used for this same purpose. In the observed touch experiment, the questions and the button-press events were included into the model as regressors. We used one-sample   t   tests at the second level to calculate different contrasts for the physical and observed touch experiments. All contrasts on the group level and on the normalized single-subject level were a priori masked with the anatomical S1 mask offered by the Anatomy Toolbox implemented in SPM8. Because the functionally scanned regions were manually selected in each individual subject based on the T1 scans (see Fig.  ), thus always covering S1 but covering varying parts of the motor or parietal cortices depending on the individual subject’s brain anatomy, this anatomical masking ensured comparable data analyses for all participants. 

For the group-level calculations, reported voxels of the functional data were considered significant at   p   < 0.001 when belonging to a cluster significant at   p   < 0.05 (FWE-corrected). In addition, we describe some of the group-level clusters at uncorrected cluster-thresholds (i.e., without FWE-correction) when this provided additional information (for example on the question of whether ipsilateral S1 would show any sub-threshold activity). When these more liberal analyses were used, it is explicitly pointed out in the results section. In addition to group-level analyses, single-subject analyses were also performed in order to describe some of the reported effects in greater detail. For the single-subject analyses, reported voxels were thresholded at   p   < 0.001. They are mentioned when belonging to a cluster with a minimum size of five voxels (16.8 mm ). 

#### Topographical arrangement 
  
For the physical touch experiment, we calculated the main effect of physical touch perception versus rest (IF touch + MF touch + BF touch − 3 × rest), and the specific effects of touch applied only to the IF, MF, and to BF, respectively (e.g., IF touch – rest). For the observed touch experiment, we calculated the main effect of observing touch to the hand versus observing no touch to the hand, as presented in the videos [(self-related observed touch IF + self-related observed touch MF + self-related observed touch BF − 3 × no-touch self) + (other-related observed touch IF + other-related observed touch MF + other-related observed touch BF − 3 × no-touch other)]. This effect was also calculated separately for observing touch to the IF, MF and BF, respectively. To look at whether S1 RFs during observed touch were topographically aligned, we masked the observed touch contrasts with the corresponding physical touch masks (e.g., observed touch IF – no-touch masked with IF touch – rest) and non-corresponding physical touch masks (e.g., observed touch IF – no-touch masked with MF touch – rest). Physical touch masks contained all voxels significant at   p   < 0.001 that belonged to a cluster significant at   p   < 0.05 (FWE-corrected). In addition, we estimated whether the topographical arrangement of S1 RFs during observed touch followed the expected pattern (i.e., the RF of the IF was supposed to be more lateral, more anterior, and more inferior than the RF of the MF). 


#### Suppressive interactions 
  
To calculate suppressive interactions between adjacent RFs in S1, we compared the expected activity changes to the actual activity changes during BF physical stimulation or observation, respectively. More precisely, for the physical touch experiment, we calculated the expected activity changes in S1 in the case where signal changes during touch applied to the IF and MF added up linearly. This was calculated as a first-level contrast [i.e., (IF touch – rest) + (MF touch – rest)]. This contrast was then compared with the actual activity changes during BF stimulation (i.e., BF touch – rest). Also this calculation was performed at the first-level. Note that this is analogous to how suppressive interactions during physical touch were characterized in a previous fMRI study (Ruben et al.  ), as we confirmed in an additional analysis (results not reported). 

For the observed touch experiment, analogous methodology was applied: to measure suppressive interactions during observed touch, we first calculated the expected activity changes in S1 if activity changes during observed touch to the IF and MF added up linearly [i.e., (self-related observed touch MF + self-related observed touch IF − 2 × no-touch self) + (other-related observed touch MF + other-related observed touch IF − 2 × no-touch other)]. To define suppressive interactions during observed touch, this contrast was compared with actual S1 activity changes during observed touch to BF [i.e., (self-related observed touch BF − no-touch self) + (other-related observed touch BF − no-touch other)]. These same analyses were also performed separately for the self- and other-related observed touch conditions. 

The suppressive interaction contrast therefore specified signal decreases in S1 that particularly occur in the BF stimulation and observation conditions, respectively. Signal decreases in these conditions that most likely reflect suppressive interactions are those which occur in voxels that belong to the RF of one of the two single fingers. Other signal drops can be less easily explained by suppressive interactions between adjacently activated RFs. We, therefore, spatially specified the suppressive interaction contrast by only describing significant activity decreases in voxels that that belonged to the RFs either of the IF or of the MF. More precisely, the suppressive interaction contrast for physical touch perception was masked by all voxels that were activated by physical IF stimulation plus those that were activated by physical MF stimulation at   p   < 0.001 belonging to a cluster of   p   < 0.05 (FWE-corrected; see Ruben et al.   for a similar approach). The suppressive interaction effect for observed touch was analogously masked by all voxels that were activated during observed touch to the IF plus those that were activated during observed touch to the MF. Here, we restricted our search volume to this mask area. Note that this spatial specification was necessary in order to clearly identify signal decreases that were specific to the effect under investigation (i.e., suppressive interactions). 

We also needed a way of quantifying the degree of suppressive interactions, both during physical touch perception and during touch observation. Using contrast estimates, we calculated interaction ratios (IRs), which have frequently been used to specify the relation between expected and real activity changes in S1 (IR = 100 − ([BF/(IF + MF)] × 100); Biermann et al.  ; Hsieh et al.  ; Ishibashi et al.  ; Ruben et al.  ). We used the masks created for specifying the suppressive interaction contrast for physical touch and observed touch (see previous paragraph) to extract all relevant contrast estimates for each individual subject. The individual IRs could then be used to calculate the mean IR across participants. This allows a much more detailed and spatially specific analysis than taking the contrast estimates as a mean across the whole group of participants. However, this procedure comes with the cost of only allowing the analysis of those participants for whom a mask could be created. More precisely, only those participants who showed significant activity changes at the single-subject level for physically/visually perceiving touch to the MF and IF could be included. As expected, this was the case for all participants with respect to physical touch perception (  N   = 15). However, this was not the case for all participants with respect to touch observation. More precisely,   n   = 10 participants could be used to calculate the mean IR for observed touch, and   n   = 9 participants could be used to calculate the mean IR for self-related observed touch. For other-related observed touch, only   n   = 4 participants fulfilled these criteria (i.e.,   n   = 11 participants did not show significant activity changes when observing other-related touch to the MF or to the IF at the single-subject level). Thus, the mean IR for other-related observed touch was not calculated. 

To summarize, whereas voxel-wise statistics included all participants (  N   = 15), contrast estimates to calculate the IR during observed touch could only be extracted for a subset of participants due to the masking procedure that required significant single-subject results [  n   = 10 for main effect of observed touch,   n   = 9 for self-related observed touch,   n   = 4 for other-related observed touch (not calculated)]. 


#### Overlapping RFs 
  
To find out whether suppressive interactions occurred only in voxels where IF and MF RFs overlapped (and could, thus, theoretically be explained by ceiling effects of the BOLD signal, for example), or also occurred in non-overlapping voxels, we additionally calculated whether suppressive interactions occurred only in “overlapping”, or also in “non-overlapping” S1 voxels. Overlapping voxels were defined as those voxels in S1 that were active when both touch to the IF and touch to the MF were observed (i.e., observed touch IF – no-touch ∩ observed touch MF – no-touch) or experienced (IF touch – rest ∩ MF touch – rest), whereas non-overlapping voxels were those which did not overlap between the two contrasts. We calculated the percentage (%) of suppressive interaction voxels in either category (i.e., suppressive interaction effect in overlapping and non-overlapping voxels) separately for physical and observed touch. 



### Behavioral analyses 
  
During the observed touch experiment, participants solved a secondary two-alternative forced-choice task in the scanner, in which they had to indicate which of two subsequently presented video clips displayed the rougher paintbrush pair. The two video clips presented in one trial always showed paintbrushes of different roughness levels, such that a correct or incorrect response could be given in each trial. We performed a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to estimate the influence of hand identity (self-related, other-related) and observed event (observed touch, no-touch) on the percentage of correct responses given in this task. We also calculated a one-way ANOVA to estimate the influence of finger touch (MF, IF, BF) on the percentage of correct responses. To investigate whether the individual degrees of suppressive interactions across trials were related to how precisely roughness levels could be estimated by sight, we performed Pearson correlations between individual IRs during touch observation and the percentage of correct responses both for the IRs across conditions and the IRs for the self-conditions. 



## Results 
  
### Topographical arrangement 
  
As expected, physical touch administered to participants’ right fingers activated, as a main effect, a large significant cluster in left (contralateral) S1 that peaked in left posterior S1, and extended to left anterior S1. Touch applied specifically to the right IF, MF, or to BF, respectively, also activated significant focal areas in left S1. The IF and MF RFs partly overlapped, but were also partly distinct. The significant clusters peaked in left posterior S1, but extended to left anterior S1 (see Fig.  a; Table  ). No significant activity changes were found in right (ipsilateral) S1 for these contrasts. We also looked at sub-threshold activity in ipsilateral S1. Here, we found that when the significance threshold of   p   < 0.001 and   k   ≥ 5 was not FWE-corrected, one cluster in right (ipsilateral) S1 showed greater activity during physical touch perception compared with rest [  k   = 9;   t   = 4.05; 53, −18, 34 (  x  ,   y  ,   z  )] (see Online Resource 2 for a complete list of sub-threshold activity changes).

For observed touch, we found that looking at a hand being touched compared with looking at the same hand not being touched significantly increased activity in left (contralateral) posterior S1. Note that participants did not receive any tactile stimulation in either of these observation conditions. No significant activity changes were found for the reverse contrast (no-touch vs. observed touch). In addition, we were interested in whether right (ipsilateral) S1 would show any sub-threshold activity during touch observation. When we omitted the FWE-correction, significant activity changes in ipsilateral S1 were found (  p   < 0.001 and   k   ≥ 5). This cluster was localized in posterior parts of right S1 (see Online Resource 2 for a list of all sub-threshold activity changes). 

Observing touch to specific fingers also activated left (contralateral) S1. Whereas activity changes in left S1 during observed touch to the IF and to BF survived the standard cluster-corrected thresholds, activity change in left S1 during observed touch to the MF was only significant when no cluster-correction was applied (  p   < 0.001 and   k   ≥ 5). All observed touch clusters peaked in left posterior S1 (see Table  ; Fig.  ). To verify that activity changes in contralateral S1 in response to touch observation were restricted to posterior S1, and did not occur in anterior S1 (particularly in area 3b), we conducted an ROI analysis focusing on left area 3b. We masked the contrast observed touch–no-touch with the left area 3b mask provided by the Anatomy toolbox implemented in SPM. Here, we found that no significant activity changes survived the standard significance threshold, even when voxels at   p   < 0.001 and   k   ≥ 5 belonging to uncorrected clusters were taken into account. 

We also looked at whether S1 activity changes during observed touch overlapped with S1 activity changes during physical touch. We masked the contrast observed touch–no-touch with physical touch–rest, and found that significant clusters for touch observation were present in posterior contralateral S1. Similarly, we found that activity changes specific to observing touch to the IF were still significant when masked with the effect of physically experiencing touch to the IF (number of voxels: 124), but not when masked with the effect of physically experiencing touch to the MF (number of voxels: 111). The significant overlap was found in left posterior S1 (see Table  ; Fig.  ). As explained above, observing touch to the MF evoked activity changes in contralateral S1, significant only when no cluster-correction was applied. We then looked at whether these clusters would be preserved when masked with physical touch to the IF or MF. We found that one cluster remained significant both when masked with physical touch to the MF and when masked with physical touch to the IF (number of voxels MF mask: 25, number of voxels IF mask: 23). This overlap was also found in left posterior S1 (see Table  ; Fig.  ). To estimate whether the mask would have any significant effect on the number of voxels included in the corresponding and non-corresponding masks, we performed a Chi-square test including the number of voxels significant within the two mask conditions of both contrasts. This test did not reach statistical significance (  p   > 0.2). When estimating the percentage of participants who showed overlapping activity changes between physical and observed touch in the different conditions, we found that 75 % of participants showed shared voxels for observed touch to the IF, 78 % showed shared voxels for observed touch to the MF, and 92 % showed shared voxels for observed touch to BF.

We additionally looked at the topographic arrangement of activity changes as evoked by observing touch to the IF and the MF, respectively. We found that activity changes in both conditions were partly overlapping, but partly distinct. Importantly, activity changes evoked by observing touch to the IF were more lateral, more anterior, and more inferior than activity changes evoked by observing touch to the MF (see Table  ; Fig.  ).

Shown are five axial slices ordered from inferior (  z   = 42) to superior (  z   = 47) of   N   = 15 participants; the borders of the MF RFs are indicated using   blue lines  ; functional images are masked with an anatomical mask covering contralateral S1 and visualized at an individual’s normalized T1 image; to make both conditions better comparable, a slightly more conservative threshold was chosen for physical touch perception [  p   < 0.0001 (uncorrected)] than for touch observation [  p   < 0.001 (uncorrected)] 
  

One last analysis was performed due to a concern that activity changes in contralateral S1 during touch observation could be explained by preparatory motor activity for the later button-press responses rather than by touch observation. To counter this argument, we looked at whether left and right primary motor cortex (M1) showed any increased activity changes during touch observation that could indicate preparatory motor activity or motor imaginary during touch observation. There were no significant activity changes neither in left nor in right M1 for the observed touch–no-touch contrast. This was also true when not correcting for multiple comparisons. 


### Suppressive interactions 
  
In order to estimate the degree of suppressive interactions in S1 during physical touch perception, we compared the summed activity changes during physical touch perception to the IF and MF to the activity changes in the BF stimulation condition. We found a significant suppressive interaction effect for physical touch in left (contralateral) S1, which peaked at the border between left area 2 and the left inferior parietal cortex, and extended to left area 2, left BA 1, and left area 3b (see Table  ; Fig.  a). No significant suppressive interaction effect was found in right (ipsilateral) S1, even when the analysis was performed without correcting for multiple comparisons. At the individual subject level, suppressive interactions for physical touch were significant in all but one of the investigated participants (  n   = 14), and could be assigned to left area 1 and left area 2. Only a subset of participants showed additional significant activity changes in left area 3b (  n   = 4) and left area 3a (  n   = 2) for this contrast. The mean IR for physical touch perception was 37.2 %, SD = 15.9 (Fig.  a, see Fig.   for single subject data). 

We then calculated the suppressive interaction effect for observed touch, which was similarly calculated by comparing summed activity changes in S1 evoked by observing touch to two single fingers separately to activity changes evoked by observing touch to both fingers together. Here, we found a significant suppressive interaction effect in two clusters that both peaked in left (contralateral) area 2. One cluster also extended to left area 1, the other extended to the left superior parietal lobule (see Table  ; Fig.  b). No significant suppressive interaction effect was found for right (ipsilateral) S1. At the individual subject level, we found a significant suppressive interaction effect in left S1 for   n   = 8 participants (see individual subject data of   n   = 5 participants in Fig.  ). In all of them, the effect was located in left area 2. In   n   = 7 participants, activity changes also extended to left area 1, and in one subject, the activity changes extended to left area 3. Note that most of the other participants also showed suppressive interaction voxels in left S1 during observed touch, but these results are not reported due to the relatively conservative single-subject threshold we defined for our analyses [e.g.,   n   = 14 participants showed a suppressive interaction effect when we lower the single-subject threshold to   p   < 0.005 (uncorrected)].

The   left side   of the figure shows functional data of physical touch to the index finger (IF), the middle finger (MF), and the suppressive interaction (SI) effect for physical touch; the   right side   of the figure shows functional data of observed touch to the IF, the MF, and the SI effect for observed touch; note that the same axial and coronal slices of the same subjects can here be visually compared; functional data are presented at the individual’s normalized T1-anatomical scans; to make both conditions better comparable, a slightly more conservative threshold was chosen for physical touch perception [  p   < 0.001 (uncorrected)] than for touch observation [  p   < 0.005 (uncorrected)] 
  

We also calculated the suppressive interaction effect specifically for self- and other-related observed touch. The suppressive interaction effect for self-related observed touch revealed one significant cluster in left area 2. The suppressive interaction effect for other-related observed touch did not reveal any significant activity changes in S1. At the individual subject level,   n   = 8 participants showed a suppressive interaction effect for self-related observed touch, and   n   = 4 participants showed a suppressive interaction effect for other-related observed touch. The mean IR for self-related observed touch was 54.93 %, SD = 11.35. The mean IR for observed touch (main effect) was 50.22 %, SD = 9.35. 


### The role of overlapping RFs 
  
We found that the suppressive interaction effect for physical touch occurred in both overlapping and non-overlapping S1 voxels. More precisely, we found part of the cluster of the suppressive interaction effect for physical touch in overlapping voxels [  k   = 113;   t   = 7.47; −54, −26, 39 (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ), localized in left area 2, the left inferior parietal cortex, and left area 1] and part of the cluster in non-overlapping voxels [  k   = 7,   t   = 4.74, −52, −21, 38 (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ), localized in left area 2, the left inferior parietal cortex, and left area 3b]. Also at the individual subject level, the suppressive interaction effect for physical touch occurred within both overlapping and non-overlapping S1 voxels in all subjects. As a mean across participants, 79 % of the suppressive interaction voxels were overlapping voxels, whereas 21 % were non-overlapping voxels. 

The suppressive interaction effect for observed touch was, on the group level, only observed in non-overlapping S1 voxels [  k   = 14;   t   = 4.61; −56, −24, 45 (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ), localized in left area 2]. When looking at the individual subject level, however, the effect was found both in overlapping and non-overlapping S1 voxels in all participants. Across participants, 60 % of the voxels that showed a suppressive interaction effect were overlapping voxels, and the remaining 40 % were non-overlapping voxels. For self-related observed touch, again suppressive interactions at the group level were only found in non-overlapping S1 voxels [  k   = 14;   t   = 4.62; −42, −40, 62 (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ), localized in left area 2,   k   = 9;   t   = 4.93; −49, −36, 57 (  x  ,   y  ,   z  )]. At the single subject level, however, the effect was again found in both overlapping and non-overlapping S1 voxels. Here, 56 % of the voxels that showed suppressive interactions for self-related observed touch were overlapping voxels, and the remaining 44 % were non-overlapping voxels. 


### Behavioral results 
  
All participants performed the visual roughness discrimination task (where participants had to distinguish between roughness levels of different paintbrush pairs by sight) with high levels of accuracy [self touch: 93.1 % ± 5.4 (SD), self no-touch: 95.0 % ± 7.6 (SD), other touch: 91.8 % ± 7.4 (SD), other no-touch: 91.7 % ± 7.0 (SD),   N   = 15]. The participants maximally missed two trials throughout the entire experiment. The percentage of correct responses in the visual roughness discrimination task was not significantly influenced by hand identity (self, other) or the presence of hand touch (observed touch, no-touch). There was also no significant interaction between these two factors (  p   > 0.1). Also, the finger that was touched (IF, MF, BF) did not influence the percentage of correct responses, neither across conditions nor for the self- and other-related conditions separately (  p   > 0.05). With respect to how individual IRs related to the degree to which roughness levels could be distinguished by sight, there was a significant correlation between the individual IRs when the self was observed and the accuracy to solve the visual roughness discrimination task when self-related touch to the IF and to BF was observed (  r   = 0.78 for IF, and   r   = 0.76 for BF self,   p   < 0.05, two-tailed, see Online Resource 3). There was no such relation between the individual IRs during observed touch and percentage of accuracy across conditions. Note, however, that the number of subjects whose data were available to calculate this correlation (  n   = 9) was very small, such that this positive relation between individual IRs and behavioral performance has to be replicated and verified by future studies using a greater number of participants. 



## Discussion 
  
The present study offers the first detailed characterization of the functional architecture of S1 during touch observation. Our data show that posterior parts of contralateral S1 in particular, but not anterior parts, are activated when touch is observed on video. Activity changes in posterior S1 elicited by touch observation also overlap with those elicited by physical touch perception. Importantly, observing touch to the index finger alone or the middle finger alone offers a similar topographical arrangement of RFs in S1 as those elicited by physically perceiving touch to the same fingers. In addition, index and middle finger RFs show the characteristic dynamic shrinkage when activated concurrently not only during physical but also during visual touch perception. Our study, therefore, provides novel evidence indicating that the functional architecture in posterior S1 with respect to RF topography and RF interaction is similar between touch observation and physical touch perception. 

### Posterior S1 activity during touch observation 
  
In the present study, short video clips were presented to participants, which showed right hands being touched or not being touched by paintbrushes. By comparing observed touch conditions to conditions where no touch was observed, we found significant activity increases in left (contralateral) S1 as a main effect. This effect was not only found at the group level but also in almost all individual participants. Significant activity changes in right (ipsilateral) S1 were only found when the group level statistics were analyzed at uncorrected thresholds. The results of the present study show that observing touch to fingers of a right hand, therefore, clearly evokes activity increases in left posterior S1. 

The finding that touch observation can elicit activity increases in S1 is in accordance with a growing body of evidence suggesting the independence of S1 activity from direct somatosensory input (Chen et al.  ; Yoo et al.  ; Driver and Noesselt  ; Meehan et al.  ; Wood et al.  ). Specifically touch observation has, in a number of fMRI studies, been shown to trigger profound activity increases in S1 (Blakemore et al.  ; Ebisch et al.  ; Kuehn et al.  ; Schaefer et al.  ,  ,  ). A previous study also indicated that in particular posterior rather than anterior contralateral S1 responds to the observation of tactile events (Kuehn et al.  ). This appears to contrast findings reported in an fMRI study by Schaefer et al. ( ). Participants in that study also observed short video sequences where hands were either touched or not touched by paintbrushes. Whereas, in accordance with the present results and those previously reported, touch observation induced activity increases in posterior contralateral S1, the authors also reported responsivity of anterior S1, specifically when participants looked at a hand presented in a first-person viewing perspective. A recent study re-investigating this topic using 7 T fMRI (Kuehn et al.  ) yielded divergent findings. In that study, anterior S1 did not show significant activity changes, neither as a main effect, nor when first-person and third-person viewing perspectives were directly compared. Kuehn et al. ( ) argued that the lower spatial resolution of the data used by Schaefer et al. ( ), in terms of voxel size and smoothing, may have accounted for the divergent findings. Although an involvement of anterior S1 cannot be excluded, it seems that the major responsivity of S1 during touch observation stems from its posterior parts. This is also in accordance with the recently formulated hypothesis that posterior S1 in particular is open to social influences, for example during action observation (Keysers et al.  ). 

The high connectivity between posterior S1 and visual input areas in the parietal cortex, some of which are known to contain bimodal visuo-tactile neurons (Duhamel et al.  ; Ishida et al.  ; Lewis and Van Essen  ; Maunsell and van Essen  ; Pons and Kaas  ; Rozzi et al.  ) and to show bimodal activation pattern in humans (Sereno and Huang  ), can serve to explain this greater influence of vision on activity changes in the posterior rather than the anterior part of S1. Anterior S1 is more strongly connected to the thalamus than posterior S1 (Kaas  ; Nelson and Kaas  ); therefore, we assume that the thalamus did not strongly contribute to the S1 activity observed in the present study. A dichotomic division of S1 into posterior S1, showing pronounced reactivity to visual input (e.g., during observed touch) and anterior S1, which may still be regarded as a unisensory brain area mainly driven by bottom-up somatosensory input, has been suggested previously (Keysers et al.  ; Kuehn et al.  ), and is supported by our results. 

Another important question is whether the activity changes in posterior S1 found in our study were triggered by touch observation, or resulted from preparatory motor responses or mental imaginary of action. Given the role of area 2 in proprioception (Hsiao and Bensmaia  ), and the involvement of S1 in motor preparation (Kawashima et al.  ), such an explanation cannot a priori be excluded. However, for the present findings, this explanation is highly unlikely. Activity changes in S1 were strongly lateralized to left S1 (contralateral to the observed touch events), whereas right S1 (contralateral to the motor response) showed only sub-threshold activity. In addition, we did not find any activity increases in left or right M1 during touch observation, which would be expected if one assumed an involvement of motor preparation (Kawashima et al.  ) or motor imaginary (Dushanova and Donoghue  ). We are, therefore, confident that the S1 activity reported in the present study is due to touch observation rather than preparatory motor activity or motor imaginary. 


### Topography of S1 activity during touch observation 
  
In order to describe the functional architecture of posterior S1 during touch observation, we first looked at whether S1 activity during observed and physically perceived touch showed a regional overlap. Any overlap would indicate a resonance response (Hogeveen and Obhi  ; Landmann et al.  ; Virji-Babul et al.  ) within S1 between physically perceived and observed touch. Such resonance responses have often been described for the motor system (Buccino et al.  ; Mukamel et al.  ; see Caspers et al.   and Gazzola and Keysers   for an overview), the insula (Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al.  ; Singer et al.  ; see Bernhardt and Singer   and Lamm et al.   for an overview), S2 (Keysers et al.  ), and also for S1 (Blakemore et al.  ; Ebisch et al.  ; Schaefer et al.  ). However, so far, they have not been characterized with such a high sensitivity and high spatial specificity as offered by the design of the present study. Whereas previous studies indicated spatial specificity of S1 activity when touch to different body areas, such as the face and neck, was observed (Blakemore et al.  ), or showed that observing hand touch elicited specific activity increases in the hand area of S1 (Kuehn et al.  ; Schaefer et al.  ), the present study indicates a spatially specific resonance response at the level of the single finger. More precisely, observing touch to the index finger overlapped with activity changes during physically experiencing touching of the index finger, and observing touch to the middle finger overlapped with activity changes during physically experiencing touching of the middle finger. Interestingly, whereas this resonance response seemed relatively specific for the index finger (i.e., S1 responses to observing touch to the index finger significantly overlapped with those to physical touching of the index finger, but did not significantly overlap with those to physical touching of the middle finger), this specificity was not present for observing touch to the middle finger. Here, the same significance level was reached irrespectively of whether the contrast of observing touch to the middle finger was masked with physical touching of the index finger or physical touching of the middle finger. In addition, the responsivity of S1 was generally larger when touching to the index finger was observed compared with when touching to the middle finger was observed. These results indicate that observing touch to the index finger leads to higher and spatially more specific responses in S1 compared to observing touch to the middle finger. These results could be explained by the generally enhanced use of the index finger compared to the middle finger, for example during the so called precision grip (Napier  ). In studies on the motor system, greater experience in a certain motor behavior has been shown to lead to increased responses in the motor system not only during action performance (Karni et al.  ,  ) but also during action observation (Calvo-Merino et al.  ; Cross et al.  ). In addition, a more precise response of the action observation network has also been assumed for participants that have more experience with the observed actions (Cross et al.  ; Diersch et al.  ). One may therefore argue that the results of the present study indicate a similar relation in the somatosensory system. Increased tactile experience of a certain body area, such as the index finger, that has been shown to relate to increased S1 activity (Braun et al.  ; Pleger et al.  ) and better discrimination abilities (Braun et al.  ; Ragert et al.  ; Schweizer et al.  ) during physical touch perception, may also cause a stronger and more precise representation during touch observation. 

It is important to note, however, that the present data do now allow a direct comparison between touch observation and physical touch perception. Whereas in the observed touch videos, different paintbrushes were used for tactile stimulation, and a roughness task had to be solved, in the physical touch experiment, tactile stimulation was applied passively, and the same paintbrushes were used for tactile stimulation. The experimental set-ups therefore differ, and do not allow direct comparison of S1 RFs as evoked by visual and physical touch perception. Future studies should use completely analogue designs with respect to stimulus characteristics and attention requirements in order to compare the overlap between RFs in both conditions more precisely. Only such a design would finally allow conclusions to be drawn about the specificity of the activity overlap between physical touch perception and touch observation. 

A second main aspect that characterizes S1 topography during touch observation is the topographical arrangement of the evoked activity changes. Our results show that activity changes in S1 during touch observation to the index finger were partly distinct, and located more lateral, more anterior, and more inferior than activity changes in S1 during touch observation to the middle finger. This topographical alignment of index and middle finger RFs follows exactly the same pattern as has classically been described for physical touch (Nelson and Chen  ), and as has also been found in the present study. This indicates a surprisingly precise representation of observed touch events in S1, and assumes a precision down to the level of the single finger. Should further studies manifest this finding, this would offer another parallel to the action system. Also, observing motor movements of specific body parts has been shown to elicit somatotopically precise representations in the premotor cortex (Buccino et al.  ; Wheaton et al.  ); the present study assumes a similarly spatially specific and precise representation of observed human touch. 

Taken together, our results indicate that observing touch to single fingers does not simply activate the hand area in S1, but activates parts in S1 that are topographically precise. The spatial arrangement of S1 activity seems therefore highly similar during physically perceived and observed touch, which leads to the suggestion that not only action events but also tactile events can be shared between the observed person and the observer (Bufalari et al.  ). 


### Suppressive interactions during touch observation 
  
In the present study, the functional architecture in S1 was additionally characterized by looking at suppressive interactions between adjacently activated cortical RFs. Suppressive interactions in S1 have often been characterized by measuring the relative shrinkage of index and middle finger RFs when both are activated simultaneously, compared to when they are activated alone (Gandevia et al.  ; Ruben et al.  ). Using this approach in the present study, we found suppressive interactions mainly in posterior parts of contralateral S1, slightly extending to anterior S1. This confirms previous studies that found greater suppressive interactions during touch perception in posterior contralateral S1 (Friedman et al.  ; Ruben et al.  ; Sur  ; Sripati et al.  ), which may indicate an increasing convergence of somatosensory input from anterior to posterior sites of S1 (Ruben et al.  ). Also the mean interaction ratio found in the present study (38 %) was similar to that which has been described previously (Biermann et al.  ; Gandevia et al.  ; Ruben et al.  ). These comparable results between the present and previous attempts to characterize suppressive interactions in S1 confirm that the present approach was, in principle, suitable to characterize this phenomenon. 

This is important given that analogue contrasts were used to characterize suppressive interactions during touch observation. This characterization was attempted for the first time in the present study. Here, we looked at whether suppressive interactions in S1 would similarly occur when touch to two fingers, compared to two single fingers separately, was not physically experienced but merely observed. Our data indicate that suppressive interactions in S1 may also occur during touch observation. More precisely, we found that observing touch to two fingers elicited decreased activity levels in S1 compared to observing touch to two single fingers separately, an effect that was specific for the areas in S1 where observed touch to single fingers separately elicited effects. Spatially, the effect was restricted to contralateral posterior S1, which was expected given that touch observation particularly activated posterior parts of contralateral S1. Importantly, suppressive interactions were also found in voxels that did not overlap between index and middle finger RFs, making vascular ceiling or saturation effects an unlikely explanation for the observed effects (Beauchamp et al.  ; Gardner and Costanzo  ). 

It is important to note, however, that while the principle way of characterizing suppressive interactions during visual and physical touch perception in the present study was similar, the results of these two analyses should not be compared directly. During physical touch perception, participants lay in the scanner with their eyes closed, while they actively solved a roughness discrimination task during touch observation. Because previous research has evidenced an influence of attention on suppressive interactions in S1 (Braun et al.  ), the suppressive interaction effect in both conditions is not directly comparable because attentional demands varied between both experiments. Secondly, there was a difference in control conditions. During touch observation, S1 activity changes were compared to a control condition (i.e., where participants saw hands which were not being touched), whereas in the physical touch condition, no such control condition was present (i.e., physical touch perception was compared to a rest condition). Given that merely looking at hands may influence S1 activity (Fiorio and Haggard  ; Longo et al.  ) and the degree of suppressive interactions in S1 (Cardini et al.  ), one should avoid comparing the degree of suppressive interactions between physical and visual touch perception in the present study directly. 

The indicated existence of suppressive interactions in S1 during touch observation can be embedded into the results from recent studies that assign S1 a specific and highly flexible role during touch and action observation (Avenanti et al.  ; Bolognini et al.  ; Bufalari et al.  ; Caspers et al.  ; Keysers et al.  ; Meyer et al.  ). For instance, using multivariate pattern analysis, it has been shown that activity patterns in S1 are separable when haptic exploration of different everyday objects is observed (Meyer et al.  ). Such variable and spatially specific activity changes in S1 could be regarded as an indication of the existence of inhibitory regulatory mechanisms that modulate S1 activity during touch observation. More direct evidence that vision can influence the degree of suppressive interactions in S1 during physical touch perception is offered by studies investigating somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in different viewing conditions. Here, it has been assumed that looking at a body while receiving tactile stimulation increases suppressive interactions in S1 (Cardini et al.  ; Gillmeister et al.  ), which has been related to RF sharpening in this condition (Cardini et al.  ; Haggard et al.  ). Whereas the results of the present study are, therefore, in accordance with previous investigations, they are novel because they target the mechanism of suppressive interactions during touch observation for the first time directly. 


### The relation between suppressive interactions and behavioral performance 
  
During physical touch perception, suppressive interactions are assumed to positively relate to perceived stimulus contrast (Braun et al.  ; Cardini et al.  ; Puts et al.  ). We therefore hypothesized that, if suppressive interactions during physical and observed touch share a mechanistic basis, such a relation to the ability to discriminate tactile stimulus features should also occur during touch observation. This analysis, however, was hampered by the very small sample size available to calculate this correlation (  n   = 9). However, when looking at the correlation, the degree of suppressive interactions during observed touch related positively to performance levels to discriminate roughness levels of paintbrushes by sight. Although this relation clearly needs further exploration in future studies, it indicates a powerful message: the degree of suppressive interactions in S1 during observed touch may determine the precision with which observed tactile events can be decoded by the observer. This is particularly interesting because, so far, signal decreases in S1 during touch observation are mostly assumed to indicate a lower resonance response, and are, thus, interpreted as evidence for lower degrees of inner simulation (Blakemore et al.  ; Ebisch et al.  ; Kuehn et al.  ). Given the results of the present study, this view may be rather one-dimensional. Signal decreases, at least when they can clearly be assigned to the occurrence of suppressive interactions, may indicate a more precise and less noisy, rather than a weaker, stimulus representation. This similarly holds for action observation. A recent study showed that the BOLD response in the action observation network, which is classically assumed to increase during observed actions that are more familiar (Buccino et al.  ; Calvo-Merino et al.  ; Cross et al.  ), does not increase when more familiar actions compared to less familiar actions are observed (Cross et al.  ). Given our framework, one may speculate that the decreases in the BOLD signal indicate a more precise representation of the observed familiar movements. Future studies should, therefore, take decreases of the BOLD signal into account when investigating the role of S1, or other brain areas, in the realm of social cognition. 



## Conclusions 
  
Taken together, the results from our study provide strong evidence that posterior contralateral S1 is active during touch observation, and that these activity changes overlap with those elicited by physical touch experience. In addition, our results indicate that touch observation to single fingers elicits partly distinct and topographically precise single finger representations in S1, which show similar dynamic interactions as they do during physical touch perception. Although this study only provides a first step to understanding the functional architecture of S1 in a social context, it critically emphasizes the importance of taking fine-grained architectonic details into account when describing the role of S1 in social cognition.

# Title

Regional Homogeneity of Intrinsic Brain Activity in Happy and Unhappy Individuals

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
Why are some people happier than others? This question has intrigued many researchers. However, limited work has addressed this question within a neuroscientific framework. 


## Methods 
  
The present study investigated the neural correlates of trait happiness using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) approach. Specifically, regional homogeneity (ReHo) was examined on two groups of young adults: happy and unhappy individuals (N = 25 per group). 


## Results 
  
Decreased ReHo in unhappy relative to happy individuals was observed within prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, superior temporal lobe, and retrosplenial cortex. In contrast, increased ReHo in unhappy relative to happy individuals was observed within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle cingulate gyrus, putamen, and thalamus. In addition, the ReHo within the left thalamus was negatively correlated with Chinese Happiness Inventory (CHI) score within the happy group. 


## Limitations 
  
As an exploratory study, we examined how general trait happiness is reflected in the regional homogeneity of intrinsic brain activity in a relatively small sample. Examining other types of happiness in a larger sample using a multitude of intrinsic brain activity indices are warranted for future work. 


## Conclusions 
  
The local synchronization of BOLD signal is altered in unhappy individuals. The regions implicated in this alteration partly overlapped with previously identified default mode network, emotional circuitry, and rewarding system, suggesting that these systems may be involved in happiness.

## Introduction 
  
Although happiness is almost everyone's pursuit, the capacity to be happy varies widely across people. Why are some people happier than others? A large amount of correlational research addressed this question by examining the associations between happiness and a diverse range of factors, such as wealth, marriage, and life events  . Rather than focusing on the objective determinants of happiness, the construal theory focused on explaining the individual differences in happiness with hedonically related subjective psychological processes such as self-evaluation, self-reflection, self-regulation, social comparison, and person perception  ,  . This theory suggests that our alternative perspectives (either positive or negative) and our constructions of reality have different hedonic consequences and, as such, are associated with different levels of enduring happiness  . Within this framework, a wealth of behavioral studies have shown that happy and unhappy individuals have their own temperaments in hedonically related cognitive and motivational processes. Specifically, happy individuals, unlike their unhappy peers, appear to spend less time on self-reflection, are less sensitive to negative achievement feedback  , experience positive emotion most of the time  , have superior self-regulation abilities to maintain positive affective information in working memory  , and have rich and more satisfying social relationships  . 

To date, limited work has investigated happiness within a neuroscientific framework  . Only a handful of studies have directly addressed the neural bases of trait happiness, which characterizes individuals' characteristic level of happiness during a particular period of time  . One resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) study revealed that individuals with greater activation in the left rather than the right superior prefrontal cortex were happier  . More recently, a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study demonstrated that eudaimonic happiness, which focuses on meaning and self-realization, was positively associated with gray matter volume in the right insular cortex  . Furthermore, a task-based functional MRI study focusing on emotional processes found that happier individuals showed greater amygdala responses to positive stimuli  . Thus, no resting-state fMRI research has been conducted to examine how trait happiness is reflected in the human brain. 

Resting-state fMRI research has been blooming during the last couple of decades  –  since the seminal work by Biswal et al (1995)  . Not limited by tasks, this approach has been demonstrated as a powerful tool that can reliably characterize intrinsic brain activity  – . In the present study, we used regional homogeneity (ReHo)  , a widely used resting-state fMRI measure, to examine whether the local synchronization of spontaneous brain activities was associated with trait happiness. We were particularly interested in this measure for four reasons: (1) as a data-driven method, ReHo dose not require a priori hypothesis and is suitable for exploratory analysis; (2) the test-retest reliability of ReHo is well established. With an optimized acquisition and preprocessing pipeline, ReHo has been demonstrated as a highly reliable measure to map the regional activity of the human functional connectome  ; (3) ReHo is associated with a variety of phenotypic variables, including relatively stable traits such as intelligence   and personality  , suggesting that ReHo is able to capture the trait properties reflected in the intrinsic brain activity; and (4) ReHo has also been shown sensitivity to various neuropsychiatric disorders related to mood/emotional changes, such as depression  ,   and social anxiety disorders  . 

In the current study, we focused on obtaining preliminary knowledge on the neural signature of happiness by examining whether happy and unhappy individuals differed in ReHo. Building on the evidence that happy and unhappy individuals differed in self-evaluation, self-reflection, self-regulation, and person perception  – , we predict that the two groups will differ in ReHo within regions implicated in these functions. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Ethics statement 
  
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Southwest University. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and they were informed that they can quit at any time during the experiment. 


### Participants 
  
A total of 422 undergraduate students were sampled at the Southwest University in China and assessed with the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS)   and the Beck depression inventory (BDI)  . Seventy-eight participants were excluded from the current study due to mild to moderate depression (BDI scores >14)   and another 2 participants were excluded due to physical illness. The remaining 342 healthy participants were ranked according to the SHS scores. Given that 25 to 27 percent is most powerful in the extreme groups design  , the upper and the lower 27% were selected as the potential happy and unhappy group. The middle 46% were discarded from the current study. We started with a relatively large sample to anticipate a high dropping rate of the scan. As we expected, a large number of participants in the selected two groups withdrew from the study due to either being unwilling or unavailable to participate the scan. We finally acquired imaging data on 51 participants (see   for participants' number change at each step. happy group: N = 26, SHS = 6.50±0.29; unhappy group: N = 25, SHS = 3.96±0.45). 
   Participants flow chart.    
The four-item SHS has been frequently used to assess overall dispositional happiness and is appropriate for different ages, occupations and cultural groups  . SHS has demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.86) and high validity with Chinese Happiness Inventory (CHI, full version)   (  r   = 0.604,   p  <0.001). 


### Data acquisition 
  
The experiment was performed on a 3 Tesla Siemens Tim Trio system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Functional images were acquired using a single-shot, gradient-recalled echo planar imaging sequence (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, 32 axial slices, FOV = 192 mm×192 mm, acquisition matrix = 64×64, slice thickness  = 3 mm, with 1 mm gap, voxel size  = 3 mm×3 mm×4 mm). For each participant, a total of 8 minutes of resting data were acquired. Participants were instructed to simply rest with their eyes closed, not to think of anything in particular, and not to fall asleep. To minimize head motion, participants' heads were restricted with foam cushions. For spatial normalization and localization, high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were also acquired in sagittal orientation using a 3D magnetization prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence (176 slices, TR = 1900 ms, TE = 2.53 ms, flip angle  = 9°, resolution  = 256×256, and voxel size  = 1 mm×1 mm×1 mm) on each participant. 

Following the scan, participants' affective states were assessed with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)  . To further confirm the effectiveness of grouping using SHS, participants were assessed with CHI within one week after the scan. One participant in each group failed to complete the CHI, leaving 24 participants with valid CHI data in each group. 


### Data preprocessing 
  
Data were preprocessed using DPARSF (Data Processing Assistant and Resting-State FMRI, version 2.2)   with the following steps: (1) removing the first ten volumes to account for the T1 equilibrium effect, leaving 230 volumes for final analysis; (2) slice timing correction; (3) motion correction by realigning images to the first volume then to the mean functional image; (4) segmenting T1 images into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); (5) regressing out 27 nuisance covariates (including signals from WM, CSF, global signal, and Friston 24 motion parameters) to reduce the potential effects of physiological processes and motion. The Friston 24-parameter model (i.e., 6 head motion parameters, 6 head motion parameters one time point before, and the 12 corresponding squared items)   was used to regress out head motion effects based on recent work showing that higher-order models were more effective in removing head motion effects  ,  . The linear trends were also removed; (6) spatially normalizing the functional images to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the standard EPI template in SPM8 and resampling the images at a resolution of 3 mm×3 mm×3 mm; and (7) temporally band-pass filtering (0.01<f<0.08 Hz). 

To further rule out the residual effect of motion on ReHo, volume-level mean framewise displacement (FD) was computed  . Participants with excessive motion (outside of the 3 inter-quartile range) relative to their group were excluded as outliers. One participant from the happy group was identified as an outlier and eliminated from the analyses. The final two groups did not differ in mean FD (  t    = 0.50,   p   = 0.42; happy: 0.13±0.06 mm; unhappy: 0.14±0.06 mm). 


### Individual-level analysis 
  
For each individual, a ReHo map was generated using REST (Resting state fMRI data analysis toolkit, version 1.8)  . Specifically, the Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC) of each voxel was calculated with its nearest neighbors (26 voxels) in a voxel-wise analysis. The formula for calculating the KCC value has been expounded in a previous study  . To reduce the influence of individual variations in the KCC value, standardization of ReHo maps were done by dividing the KCC of a given voxel by the averaged KCC of the whole brain. Then, the standardized ReHo maps were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 4 mm full-width at half-maximum to reduce noise. 


### Group-level analysis 
  
One-sample t-tests were first performed within each group to detect where the standardized KCC values were larger than the global mean KCC. The results were false discovery rate (FDR) corrected at   p  <0.05  . 

To examine the group differences in ReHo, voxel-wised two-sample t-tests were performed on ReHo maps using the statistical program in the REST toolkit. Mean FD and gender were included as nuisance covariates to remove the residual effect of motion and gender effect at the group level. Following previous studies  ,  , the t-map was masked by a grey matter map, which was obtained by segmenting the mean normalized high resolution T1-weighted images of all the participants to include only the areas falling in grey matter. Multiple comparisons were corrected using Monte Carlo simulation (The AlphaSim program in REST software). The Parameters were: single voxel   p   = 0.01, combined height threshold   p  <0.05 and a cluster size >486 mm , 5000 simulations, FWHM  = 4 mm, cluster connection radius r = 5 mm). 


### Brain-behavior relationships 
  
To explore whether ReHo correlates with the level of happiness, Pearson's correlations between the mean ReHo extracted from regions showing significant group differences and the subjective happiness scores (SHS and CHI) were computed for happy and unhappy group, respectively. 



## Results 
  
### Demographical and neuropsychological results 
  
The demographical and neuropsychological results were presented in  . The happy and unhappy group did not differ in age and gender (  p  s>0.20) and as expected, significantly differed in subjective happiness measured with SHS and CHI (  p  <0.001).

### Group analysis in ReHo 
  
The mean ReHo maps for the happy and unhappy group are shown in   (one-sample t-test;   p  <0.05, FDR corrected). The default-mode network (DMN), mainly including the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and bilateral parietal lobel, has higher regional homogeneity than other brain regions ( ). This pattern is similar in the two groups and is consistent with previous studies  ,  ,  .

The two-sample t-tests results indicated that several regions were implicated in the significant group differences in ReHo (  and  ). Specifically, compared with the happy individuals, the unhappy individuals exhibited significantly decreased ReHo in the bilateral MPFC, the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), the left hippocampus (HP), the right parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), and the left posterior cingulate cortex/retrosplenial cortex (PCC/RSP). In contrast, increased ReHo was observed within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), the right middle cingulate gyrus (MCG), the right putamen (PT), and the left thalamus (TH).

### Brain-behavior correlations 
  
For the happy group, there was a significant negative correlation between the CHI and the mean ReHo within the left TH ( ,   r   = −0.43,   p   = 0.04, uncorrected). No other correlations were significant (  p  s>0.05). 
   The mean ReHo within the left Thalamus (TH_L) is negatively correlated with the Chinese Happiness Inventory (CHI).    


## Discussion 
  
The present study used resting-state fMRI approach to examine whether local functional homogeneity was modulated by happiness. Significant group differences in ReHo were observed within distributed brain regions over prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, limbic system and certain subcortical regions, suggesting multiple brain regions were involved in trait happiness. In addition, the ReHo within left thalamus was correlated with CHI in happy group, suggesting that ReHo could be useful for indexing the extent of happiness. Recently, extensive studies have reported altered ReHo in clinical populations with emotional disorders, such as depression  ,   and social anxiety disorders  . The novelty of the current study is that we observed alterations of ReHo in healthy individuals who experience more negative affect. 

ReHo measures the local synchronization of a given voxel with its nearest neighbors based on the assumption that if a brain region is responsible for a specific function, the voxels within this region were more temporally homogeneous when involved in that function  . The ReHo results during a unilateral finger movement is partly consistent with electrophysiologic studies   and resting state ReHo is of functional relevance and can predict the behavioral performance of a stop signal task  . These results suggest that altered ReHo might reflect changes in the temporal feature of intrinsic neuronal activity. 

Compared to happy individuals, unhappy individuals exhibited decreased ReHo within MPFC, VLPFC, medial temporal lobe (MTL), STG, and PCC/RSP cortex. These regions largely overlap the DMN, suggesting the involvement of DMN in happiness. This is supported by the reports that ReHo was altered within the DMN in depression  ,   and bipolar depression disorder  . DMN activity during rest is associated with mind-wandering or stimulus-independent thoughts   and a higher frequency of mind-wandering has been shown to be related to less happiness  . However, recent work demonstrated that it may not be mind-wandering per se that is responsible for psychological distress, but rather the general tendency to be less aware and attentive to the present-moment  . 

Happy and unhappy individuals have their own characteristic temperaments. Individuals with lower level of happiness spent more time ruminating on negative feelings, thoughts and shortcomings  ,  ,  , have less satisfying social function  , and envision future with less details  . These characteristics may be explained by the abnormalities in the DMN, which is involved in personal significance evaluation, self-relevant affective decision-makings, present mental states consideration, inference of other individuals' mental states, and envision future events  . The involvement of DMN in happiness also supports the construal theory which suggests self-reflection, self-evaluation, social comparison and personal perception are psychological processes that influence our constructions of reality and have hedonic consequences  . 

Converging evidence from lesion, neuroimaging and electrophysiological data supports the view that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key component of the circuitry that implements both positive and negative affect  . In our study, we found that several important subdivisions of PFC are involved in trait happiness, such as MPFC and DLPFC. MPFC played an important role in hedonic evaluation of pleasure valence  . Compared to healthy participants, decreased ReHo was observed in depression  ,   and social anxiety disorder  . Furthermore, after a 6-week duloxetine therapy, ReHo in MPFC in patients with major depressive disorder and panic disorder were significantly increased after the treatment  . Consistent with these studies, we also found decreased ReHo within MPFC for individuals who have lower level of happiness. 

In contrast, higher ReHo was found within left DLPFC for unhappy individuals. One methodological limitation of the ReHo approach is that its biological significance is still unclear, thus it is difficult to interpret the exact meaning of the opposite effects observed within MPFC and DLPFC  . However, our findings support the view that these two regions played different functional roles in emotion  . One main role of DLPFC is executive control  ,  . Happy individuals, relative to unhappy individuals, experienced more positive moods  , this is possibly due to happy people having greater cognitive control abilities to regulate negative emotional experience   and maintain and update positive information in working memory  . Evidence from clinical populations further supports the role of DLPFC in emotional regulation. For example, patients with left DLPFC damage have an increasing likelihood of depressive symptoms   which is associated with deficits in positive affect   In late-life subthreshold depression   and major depressive disorder   patients, abnormal resting-state ReHo and functional connectivity were also reported within this region. 

Besides the DLPFC, the right MCG, right putamen, and left thalamus also exhibited increased ReHo in unhappy individuals. Furthermore, the ReHo score within the left thalamus is negatively correlated with CHI scores in happy group. Previous personality neuroimaging studies demonstrated that the volume of MCG was correlated with neuroticism  . Neuroticism is characterized by anxiety, guilt, and emotional instability. Compared with other personality traits, neuroticism is the strongest predictor of happiness  . Thus, the increased regional coherence in unhappy individuals within MCG may suggest that unhappy individuals are less emotionally stable and more reactive to stress, compared with their happy peers. 

Both the striatum  –  and the thalamus  ,   played a critical role in reward processing. Specifically, the putamen is not only involved in processing reward outcome, but also engaged in anticipating a reward  ,   and the thalamus is suggested to be one of the core areas regulating reward processing  . Reward is important for driving incentive-based learning, approaching reward object, and inducing positive emotions  . Dysfunction in reward processing may lead to mood disorders  . Previous studies have reported increased ReHo in right PT in patients with social anxiety disorder  ,  , and greater functional connectivity between TH and subgenual cingulate in patients with depression  . These results support our finding that these two regions were implicated in happiness. 

Although the current results provided novel information on our understanding of happiness, several limitations need to be considered. First of all, general trait happiness instead of a specific type of happiness was assessed in the current study. As happiness can be divided into hedonic (pleasure attainment and pain avoidance) and eudaimonic components (meaning and self-realization)  , refined studies to elucidate the neural underpinning of different types of happiness are needed. Secondly, although we started with a large initial sample, the final sample size is relatively small, which may decrease the statistical power to detect the correlations between ReHo and happiness. Limited power also prevented us from investigating the interaction between happiness and gender on ReHo. As this is still an unexplored question and previous behavioral and neuropsychological studies have reported inconsistent results, it would be of merit to tackle this question in our future study. Finally, recent work showed that ReHo is correlated with neurovascular variables and the contribution of ReHo to task activation can be counted by neurovascular factors  . Thus, alterations in ReHo might not purely reflect changes in neuronal activity but instead it might reflect changes in neurovascular coupling, or both. Future work is needed to investigate the physiological significance of ReHo before we can more accurately interpret the direction of the results (e.g. increased or decreased ReHo in certain regions for one group compared with another group). 


## Conclusions 
  
In summary, we used a ReHo approach to investigate the differences in intrinsic brain activities between happy and unhappy individuals. We found that the local synchronization of intrinsic brain activities was altered in unhappy individuals within prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, limbic system, and subcortical regions. These regions overlapped with the previously identified DMN, which suggests that DMN plays an important role in subjective happiness and is in support of the construal theory. Our findings also provide further evidence to support that core components of the emotional and rewarding network are involved in happiness.

# Title

Towards neural correlates of auditory stimulus processing: A simultaneous auditory evoked potentials and functional magnetic resonance study using an odd-ball paradigm

# Keywords

auditory pathways
functional magnetic resonance imaging
central auditory system
auditory evoked potential


# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
The neural underpinnings of auditory information processing have often been investigated using the odd-ball paradigm, in which infrequent sounds (deviants) are presented within a regular train of frequent stimuli (standards). Traditionally, this paradigm has been applied using either high temporal resolution (EEG) or high spatial resolution (fMRI, PET). However, used separately, these techniques cannot provide information on both the location and time course of particular neural processes. The goal of this study was to investigate the neural correlates of auditory processes with a fine spatio-temporal resolution. A simultaneous auditory evoked potentials (AEP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique (AEP-fMRI), together with an odd-ball paradigm, were used. 


## Material/Methods 
  
Six healthy volunteers, aged 20–35 years, participated in an odd-ball simultaneous AEP-fMRI experiment. AEP in response to acoustic stimuli were used to model bioelectric intracerebral generators, and electrophysiological results were integrated with fMRI data. 


## Results 
  
fMRI activation evoked by standard stimuli was found to occur mainly in the primary auditory cortex. Activity in these regions overlapped with intracerebral bioelectric sources (dipoles) of the N1 component. Dipoles of the N1/P2 complex in response to standard stimuli were also found in the auditory pathway between the thalamus and the auditory cortex. Deviant stimuli induced fMRI activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, and parietal lobes. 


## Conclusions 
  
The present study showed that neural processes evoked by standard stimuli occur predominantly in subcortical and cortical structures of the auditory pathway. Deviants activate areas non-specific for auditory information processing. 

 

# Body
 
## Background 
  
An ability to select relevant auditory stimuli from our surroundings is an important aspect of human behavior. One commonly used experimental scheme for studying neural correlates of auditory processing is the odd-ball paradigm [ ] in which a target acoustic stimulus (the deviant) is presented among frequent stimuli (the standard). The task is to respond (by pressing a button or counting silently) to the deviants and ignore the standard sounds [ ]. An odd-ball paradigm is designed to involve both perception and processing of auditory information at higher levels [ , ]. 

The neural basis of auditory information processing has been investigated using various methods [ – ]. One of these techniques is auditory evoked potentials (AEP), in which cortical responses to acoustic stimuli are registered [ – ]. It is well documented [ ] that the morphology of AEP elicited by a standard sound is different from the cortical response to a deviant. Accordingly, a standard stimulus (e.g. a pure tone) induces N1 and P2 components, which together constitute an N1/P2 complex. In response to deviants, N2 and P3 potentials are also observed, as well as N1 and P2 components [ , ]. Such differences in the morphology of AEP between deviant and standard stimuli result from the involvement of different structures in the processing of each stimulus type [ ]. 

Certain components of AEP are considered to be markers of subsequent processes engaged during the processing of a stimulus (see [ , ] for a review). Early components of AEP such as N1, P2, or N1/P2 complex are considered exogenous and reflect neural processes associated mainly with sensory and physical properties of the stimuli, or detection of nonspecific physical or semantic changes in the hearing environment [ ]. In contrast, later endogenous components are thought to be markers of cognitive processes allocated to the task [ ]. According to recent theories, the P3 potential reflects attention and working memory-dependent processes of stimulus categorization [ – ], whereas the N2 component is related to the process of matching the incoming stimulus to its internally generated contextual pattern, which occurs before the categorization [ , ]. In summary, odd-ball paradigms permit electrophysiological techniques to be used in a way that can separate the different neural processes associated with standard and deviant stimuli. 

AEP can provide information about the timing of cortical activations at different stages of auditory processing [ , , , ]. AEP allow insight into rapid neural processes because the technique has high temporal resolution (in the range of milliseconds) due to the way in which the electrical field changes are measured [ ]. During recording of AEP, rapid changes in the electrical field, induced by neural activity, propagate immediately from the involved brain area to the surface of the head. Therefore, in an odd-ball paradigm the processing underlying each type of stimulus (standard or deviant) is immediately reflected in the AEP [ , ]. 

Although EEG methods, including AEP, have high temporal resolution, their spatial resolution is limited to a few centimeters [ ]. This rather poor resolution comes from distortion of the electrical field while conducting through the skull and other brain tissues. So while AEP reflect the bioelectrical activity of particular brain structures, they are widely distributed on the surface of the head [ ]. Consequently, EEG techniques cannot provide precise information on the location of particular stages of auditory processing. 

To improve EEG spatial resolution it is necessary to sample the topographical distribution of particular AEP components at a sufficient density. For this purpose, a large number of electrodes – 32, 64, 128, or even 256 channels – have been used [ , ], enabling precise location of AEP bioelectrical sources. However, existence of an inverse problem makes the determination of AEP generators difficult because a given surface map may have been produced by many possible source distributions. In other words, the inverse problem has no unique solution. 

Intracerebral sources of particular AEP components can in theory be determined using various algorithms such as equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) or distributed source models [ , ]. A major limitation of the ECD technique is the requirement to make assumptions about the neural sources. ECDs usually assume that the underlying neuronal sources are focal. Such a supposition requires a thorough knowledge of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, and it is only reasonable for motor or sensory processes that have a well-defined representation in the brain. However, for widely distributed cognitive processes, source modeling becomes very complicated [ ]. 

Distributed source models (e.g. LORETA and sLORETA) divide the source space into a grid containing many dipoles. The inverse problem is to obtain the dipole moments for each grid node. As the number of unknown dipole moments is much greater than the number of electrodes, the inverse solution is highly underdetermined. In this technique, assumptions about the modeled EEG sources are not necessary [ , ], but the resulting distributions can be difficult to interpret because they only generate a blurred image of the neuronal source distribution. Neural sources modeling is constantly being developed to provide more precise locations of the EEG generators. However, all these techniques are very sensitive to signal distortion, and when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, source modeling is susceptible to errors [ ]. 

In view of the limitations of EEG methods in determining the source of brain activity, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to study neural processes evoked by standard and deviant acoustic stimuli (event-related fMRI) [ – ]. This technique is based on blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, discovered by Ogawa [ ], and is used to map neural activity in the brain with a high spatial resolution (a few millimeters). The technique relies on cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation being coupled. When a brain area is engaged in a task, blood flow to that region increases. Therefore, an fMRI study using an auditory odd-ball paradigm allows recording the BOLD signal from areas activated during the processing of standard and deviant stimuli. However, a limitation of the fMRI technique is its low temporal resolution. The resulting fMRI images show all brain structures activated during a whole cycle of hemodynamic response, which takes several seconds [ ]. During this time many different neural processes may occur and all of them are reflected in the fMRI images. 

Taking all the above facts into consideration, investigation of rapid and complex neural processes is a methodological challenge. One approach to solving this problem is to combine 2 techniques, one with high spatial resolution and the other with high temporal resolution. For example, AEP recording can be performed simultaneously with MEG or PET [ , ], but most studies use a combination of AEP and fMRI methods. Combination of these techniques creates a powerful tool for studying processing at different levels of the auditory pathway [ , ]. 

During the past several years, high spatio-temporal resolution methods have been used to investigate the neural processes engaged in an auditory odd-ball task. However, most of these studies focus on the brain activities related to deviants [ , , , ]. Only a few authors have attempted to describe processes and structures involved in both deviant and standard stimuli analysis [ , ], which appears to be a promising approach to investigate the processes occurring at different stages of the auditory system. 

Here, we present the preliminary results of studies on neural correlates of stimulus processing in the auditory odd-ball paradigm. Simultaneous AEP-fMRI technique was applied to measure deviant and standard induced brain activity, with good spatial and temporal resolution. Both AEP-fMRI method and an experimental procedure may be used to investigate auditory information processing at different levels of the central nervous system in clinical samples. 


## Material and Methods 
  
The AEP-fMRI study was conducted at the Bioimaging Research Center of the Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing in Warsaw, Poland. 

### Subjects 
  
Six young adults (5 male and 1 female), aged 22 to 35 years, participated in the study. All subjects had normal hearing levels in both ears (below 20 dB HL for 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Hz), relatively good health, were right-handed (  Edinburgh Handedness Inventory  [ ]) and reported no history of neuropsychiatric disorders. 

General exclusion criteria for AEP-fMRI study are ferromagnetic objects in the body and claustrophobia. During simultaneous registration of AEP and fMRI, signal subjects are asked to lie down in the same position in a limited space for about half an hour. For this reason, the AEP-fMRI procedure is not recommended for pregnant women, very young children, persons with hyperactivity, or those more prone to fatigue (e.g. elderly people and post-stroke patients). 

Each subject provided written informed consent prior to the study. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee. 


### Subject preparation and data acquisition procedure 
  
The main AEP- fMRI study was preceded by certain preparatory activities such as the attachment of electrodes (mounted in a special cap) to the subject’s head, application of a gel to the electrodes to improve the conduction of electrical impulses, measurement of impedance of the electrodes, and, finally, placing the subject in an MRI scanner. The preparation procedure took about 30 min. 

The AEP-fMRI study consisted of 2 parts: acquisition of anatomical images of the whole brain and simultaneous registration of AEP and fMRI signal in response to presented auditory stimuli. The entire AEP-fMRI study (including preparation procedure) lasted about 30 min. After completing the AEP-fMRI study, each subject had a short (15–20 min) time to rest. Then, AEP registration was performed outside an MR scanner room which took approximately 10 min. The entire procedure took 1.5 h. 


### Experimental paradigm 
  
A modified auditory odd-ball paradigm was used to acquire AEP inside an MRI scanner ( ). Pure sinusoidal 100-ms tones of different frequency (1 and 2 kHz) were delivered binaurally via electrostatic headphones at 80 dBA hearing level. The stimuli were presented in 2 alternating 30-s blocks: 1) a standard and 2) an odd-ball block. There were 10 repetitions of each block. The standard block consisted of ten 1-kHz tones, whereas the odd-ball block consisted of three 2-kHz tones (deviants) and seven 1-kHz tones (standards) presented in pseudo-random order. During the standard block, subjects were asked to listen attentively to the applied stimuli. The odd-ball task was to silently count the deviants and ignore the more frequently presented standards. During a whole run on a single subject, 30 AEP to deviants and 170 responses to standard stimuli were registered. 

fMRI data were collected according to the SPARSE acquisition schema, which allows stimuli to be presented in the absence of scanner noise [ ].   shows the stimulus scheme, in which every 6-s interval within the standard or oddball block contained 2 tones, 2 s of silence, and then a whole brain scan occupying another 2 s. 

AEP acquired in the magnet were compared with the electrophysiological responses obtained outside the MRI scanner. The paradigm used outside the scanner was virtually the same as that applied during the combined AEP-fMRI study, the only difference being the lack of scanning periods. The studies inside and outside the scanner were performed in a single session and were counterbalanced across subjects. 


### EEG data acquisition and signal preparation 
  
AEP were registered from 62 unipolar electrodes placed on the subject’s head according to the 10/10 International Standard System [ ] using a MagLink (Neuroscan) EEG recording system from Compumedics, which is designed to work in strong magnetic fields. Two pairs of bipolar electrodes were used to monitor vertical eye movements (VEOG) and the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ground electrode was placed between FCz and Fz, and the reference electrode for all unipolar electrodes was located between CPz and Cz. The impedance of each channel was kept below 10 kΩ. 

The electrophysiological data acquired during the simultaneous AEP-fMRI recordings (outside and inside the MRI scanner) were analyzed according to the following procedure. Large (thousands of μV) gradient artifacts (GAs) were first removed from the EEG signal (GAs are induced in EEG signals by magnetic field changes in the gradient coils of the MRI scanner [ ]). GAs did not interfere directly with AEP recorded during the silent intervals; however, their removal helps visualize the EEG signal and thereby improves signal processing. A high (10 kHz) sampling rate was used to remove GAs from the EEG data by subtraction of the averaged template. A corresponding template for each gradient coil activation was based on 17 artifacts surrounding the currently processed 2-s block. 

Balistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts were also removed from the EEG signal. BCG artifacts are generated by heart beats, which change the position of EEG electrodes and wires on the subject’s head and body and induce spurious voltages [ ]. A modified procedure [ , ] was performed to reduce BCG artifacts. Each well-defined QRS complex was manually marked at maximum amplitude of the R peak and then used to create a separate average BCG artifact template for each channel. These templates were used to calculate a singular value decomposition (SVD) matrix, which formed the basis of BCG component reduction. 

Artifacts induced by eye movements were also removed using the same procedure as BCG artifact reduction. After the removal of artifacts, standard AEP analysis was conducted. The recording window consisted of a 100-ms pre-stimulus period and a 750-ms post-stimulus time. Baseline correction and band-pass filtering (1–30 Hz, 12 dB/octave, no phase shift) of each epoch was performed and the signal was averaged. 


### Study design and fMRI data analysis 
  
The fMRI study was performed using a high-field (3T) Siemens Magnetom Trio Tim MRI scanner. The scanning function had the following parameters: T2 single-shot echo-planar imaging, EPI sequence, voxel size =3×3×4 mm, 32 axial slices, repetition time (TR) =6000 ms, echo time (TE) =30 ms, acquisition time (TA) =10 min. 

For structural imaging, a T1 inversion recovery sequence with the following parameters was used: voxel size =0.9×0.9×0.9 mm, 208 sagittal slices, repetition time (TR)=1900 ms, echo time (TE)=2.21 ms, inversion time (TI)=900 ms, and acquisition time (TA)=5 min. 

fMRI data obtained during simultaneous fMRI-EEG signal recording was analyzed in the SPM8 toolbox for MATLAB. Preprocessing of the brain images included movement correction (first volume was used as the reference image), co-registration with the subject’s structural brain image, and smoothing using a Gaussian spatial filter with voxel FWHM of 6 mm. A general linear model (GLM) and a high-pass filter with a period of 128 s were used to analyze BOLD signal changes. Additionally, hemodynamic response function (HRF) modeling was applied. 

For each subject, the standard   vs.   deviant and deviant   vs.   standard contrasts were calculated (the first-level analysis). Then, a 1-sample   t   test (  p  -value threshold ≤0.01) was applied for group data analysis (the second-level analysis). 


### 3D spatial current distribution modeling and intracerebral AEP source analysis 
  
A brain-mapping technique was used to model the spatial distribution of AEP voltages [ ]. Modeling was done on the bioelectric responses recorded from all electrodes during sessions outside and inside the MRI scanner. Three-dimensional distribution maps of particular AEP components were calculated and projected onto virtual and real head models (the latter created from MRI images of the subjects). 

The 3D voltage distribution maps and AEP recorded from all 62 electrodes during the combined AEP-fMRI study were used to localize the intracerebral sources (dipoles) of evoked responses. Two different methods – rotating and moving dipoles – were used to calculate AEP generators [ ]. Dipoles of subsequent components visible in the AEP to standard and deviant stimuli were modeled separately. To specify the AEP generators, time intervals during which the mean global field power (MGFP) of the modeled components reached maximum values were used. To fix the number of sources to be modeled, independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to signals in each of the predefined time ranges. The number of ICA components that explained the majority of the AEP variance was assumed to be the number of intracerebral sources for each modeled component. 

Calculation of spatial distribution and intracerebral sources (generators) of AEP was done using Curry 6.0 software (Compumedics Neuroscan, Charlotte, NC). 


### Combining AEP and fMRI results 
  
The same Curry 6.0 software was also used to combine the electrophysiological and fMRI data. The dipoles of particular AEP components uncovered by the intracerebral source analysis were combined with fMRI hemodynamic activation data. 



## Results 
  
The results of AEP and fMRI analyses were integrated to provide data with high spatial and temporal resolution. 

### Brain response to deviant stimuli 
  
 shows the average AEP to deviants averaged across all subjects. It presents electrode responses recorded during simultaneous AEP-fMRI (grey lines) compared to cortical responses obtained outside the MRI scanner (black lines). Outside the scanner, N1, P2, and P3 (P300) components could be observed in all study subjects. However, inside the magnet these components had smaller amplitudes and, as   shows, could be clearly distinguished, predominantly at central electrodes. Mean amplitudes and latencies of individual response components for deviant tones measured at C3 electrode are shown in  . 

Deviant stimuli activated bilateral insula and inferior parietal lobule as well as left anterior cingulate gyrus ( ). 


### Brain response to standard stimuli 
  
AEP to standard stimuli inside and outside the MRI scanner had a similar morphology at all electrodes ( ). Specifically, N1 and P2 components were observed in both conditions. Latencies of the components were comparable, but the amplitudes were higher outside the magnet than inside ( ). Moreover, distribution of N1 and P2 amplitudes, acquired during the simultaneous AEP-fMRI study, matched the topography of the corresponding components recorded outside the MRI scanner. Topographies of the N1 and P2 amplitudes registered inside and outside the MRI scanner were similar to those observed outside the MRI scanner (  shows the distribution of amplitudes laid out on the virtual head model). 

The AEP of individual subjects recorded inside the MRI scanner in response to standard stimuli were used to model the dipoles (intracerebral sources of bioelectric activity) of the N1 component. The procedure began from an AEP amplitude distribution plotted on the surface of a real head model created from an MRI image of the subject.   presents an example of an N1 component amplitude distribution mapped onto a model of a subject’s head. The sources of the N1 component were calculated using the method of rotating dipoles [ ]. This technique reduces the location of intracerebral sources to fixed points inside the brain space, but allows for changes in orientation and strength of the dipoles. Based on the results of ICA analysis, 2 symmetrical sources of N1 were modeled. The dipoles were calculated within the latency range in which the MGFP of the N1 component reaches its maximal value.   shows the results of such analysis, revealing 2 separate N1 generators located near the primary auditory cortex. 

The intracerebral sources of the N1/P2 complex evoked by standard stimuli were also modeled using the moving dipoles technique. All parameters of the dipoles, including locations, were allowed to vary [ ]. The moving dipoles method confirmed the results of the rotating dipoles technique (ie, 2 symmetrical dipoles of the N1/P2 complex were modeled). The N1/P2 generators (calculated at times within the N1/P2 latency of 50–120 ms) were located in brain regions where subsequent stages of information processing take place. These regions are part of the auditory pathway between the thalamus and auditory cortex ( ). It is noteworthy that fMRI data also indicates activation of the primary auditory cortex in response to standard stimuli ( ). 

To obtain data displaying both good temporal and spatial resolution, results of the moving dipole analysis of the N1/P2 complex were integrated with the fMRI outcomes. The N1/P2 generators were superimposed on the MRI images and then compared with the fMRI activations in response to the same stimuli. In most subjects (5 out of 6) the N1/P2 dipoles, modeled at a time when each component’s amplitude was at a maximum, appeared at locations close to the primary auditory cortex ( ). Similar as previously, fMRI data showed the same brain regions to be active ( ). 



## Discussion 
  
The aim of the present AEP-fMRI study was to define, both in time and space, the neural processes and areas of the brain involved in processing standard and deviant stimuli. We used an auditory odd-ball paradigm, and AEP evoked by 1000 Hz (standard) and 2000 Hz (deviant) tones were recorded simultaneously with hemodynamic (fMRI) responses triggered by these 2 stimulus types. 

We obtained bioelectrical (AEP) responses to standard and deviant stimuli, and the morphology of individual AEP components and their parameters (amplitude and latency) to both these stimulus types were compared to AEP evoked by the same stimuli outside the MRI scanner ( ,  ). AEP components induced inside the scanner had smaller amplitudes compared to those outside the scanner room. Others have also found similar reductions [ – ], and one possibility is that this might be due to constant activation of the auditory cortex from noise generated by the MRI gradient coils (approximately 99 dB SPL) [ ]. 

Our AEP-fMRI study showed that electroencephalographic responses to standard stimuli were localized to the primary auditory cortex ( ,   and  ). These results are in accordance with reports on neural processes evoked by standard stimuli using both fMRI [ , ] and simultaneous AEP-fMRI [ , , ]. In our studies, the primary auditory cortex was stimulated by frequent acoustic stimuli presented in an odd-ball paradigm. In contrast to standard stimuli, deviants activated structures that are not part of the central auditory system (ie, the inferior parietal lobule, anterior cingulate gyrus, and insula ( ). Similar brain activations have been found in previous studies using experimental paradigms that involved cognitive or emotional processes [ , ]. Such studies used AEP, fMRI, and either simultaneous AEP-fMRI or VEP-fMRI to determine P3 generators [ , – ]. Previous work has also indicated that the inferior parietal lobule is engaged in tasks requiring decision making [ ] and has been considered to play important role in visuo-motor integration and spatial perception [ ], emotion recognition [ ], language [ ], and mathematical reasoning [ ]. 

In response to standard stimuli, our study was able to locate the intracerebral bioelectrical generators of individual components of the AEP. We used the moving and rotating dipoles techniques, and both methods provide results corresponded with the fMRI findings. Obtained locations of the intracerebral bioelectrical generators were also congruent with the results reported by other authors [ , ]. However, the deviant tones work was a different matter – when we attempted to determine the generators of the N1, P2 or N1/P2 complex, and P3 using such stimuli, and combine them with fMRI and MRI data, locations of the modeled dipoles did not completely overlap with fMRI activations. This effect might result from a low signal-to-noise ratio in AEP in responses to deviants. A minimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the EEG signals used for modeling the intracerebral bioelectrical generator to achieve reliable results should be <4 [ , ]. In our study, SNR for AEP to deviants was below this value, so in this case we decided to not interpret the results of modeling of AEP generators. Low SNR in EEG signal recorded in the magnet in responses to deviants might be caused by specific experimental conditions during simultaneous AEP and fMRI data registration; a high magnetic field induces specific artifacts in EEG signal leads to decreasing SNR ratio [ ]. Moreover, the relatively small number of deviants (n=30) applied in our odd-ball paradigm most likely contributed to a low SNR value. Presentation of more deviant stimuli would, however, significantly extend the testing time inside an MRI scanner, leading to subject fatigue and decreasing motivation to perform the auditory task [ ]. A number of infrequent stimuli used in our odd-ball paradigm theoretically should enable modeling AEP generators, but, unfortunately, it turned out to be insufficient. Therefore, we suggest an increased number of deviants and perhaps some modifications of an experimental protocol in an AEP-fMRI procedure. Such improvements would allow for more pronounced brain (bioelectrical and hemodynamic) responses and a relatively short testing time. In this case, a paradigm could be suitable not only for young adults but also for children, elderly people, and clinical trials. 


## Conclusions 
  
The presented AEP-fMRI odd-ball paradigm allows examination of the neural processes related to analysis of deviant and standard stimuli, with high spatio-temporal resolution. In responses to deviant stimuli, we found activations in the cortical regions not directly involved in the central auditory processes, whereas both low (subcortical) and high (cortical) levels of the auditory system were engaged in the standards processing. 

A method of simultaneous AEP and fMRI signal registrations combines fMRI’s ability to precisely locate the blood dynamics in the whole brain with the electrophysiological ability to characterize rapid neural processes and to reveal pathological patterns. Therefore, our AEP-fMRI study might provide clinically useful information about the functioning of the central auditory system. 

Because of the prolonged testing time inside an MRI scanner and the complexity of the procedure, we recommended the presented odd-ball paradigm for adult and relatively cooperative patients. However, this protocol, after small modifications, might also be adapted to investigate central auditory information processing in clinical trials.

Increased BOLD signal in the fusiform gyrus during implicit emotion processing in anorexia nervosa☆

# Keywords

# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
The behavioural literature in anorexia nervosa (AN) has suggested impairments in psychosocial functioning and studies using facial expression processing tasks (FEPT) have reported poorer recognition and slower identification of emotions. 


## Methods 
  
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used alongside a FEPT, depicting neutral, mildly happy and happy faces, to examine the neural correlates of implicit emotion processing in AN. Participants were instructed to specify the gender of the faces. Levels of depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive symptoms and eating disorder behaviour were obtained and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to acquire uncorrelated variables. 


## Results 
  
fMRI analysis revealed a greater blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response in AN in the right fusiform gyrus to all facial expressions. This response showed a linear increase with the happiness of the facial expression and was found to be stronger in those not taking medication. PCA analysis revealed a single component indicating a greater level of general clinical symptoms. 


## Conclusion 
  
Neuroimaging findings would suggest that alterations in implicit emotion processing in AN occur during early perceptual processing of social signals and illustrate greater engagement on the FEPT. The lack of separate components using PCA suggests that the questionnaires used might not be suited as predictive measures. 

   Highlights  
  
Greater BOLD response in AN in the right fusiform gyrus to all facial expressions. 
  
The BOLD response showed a linear increase with the happiness of the expression 
  
The BOLD response was stronger in those not taking psychotropic medication 
  
These alterations occur during early perceptual processing of social signals

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder primarily affecting young women and is associated with the highest levels of social impairment and lifetime suicidality amongst all eating disorders ( ,  ) as well as one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder ( ). Character traits such as negative emotionality (affect and attitudes), harm avoidance and perfectionism have been reported both in children who later develop AN as well as in long-term recovered patients and may contribute to the development of AN ( ). Similarly, several studies have reported the onset of an anxiety disorder before the onset of an eating disorder, with a large number endorsing a social phobia ( ,  ). 

Over 55% of AN patients have at least one comorbid disorder and this may explain some of the heterogeneity commonly observed in the AN population ( ,  ). Current literature on the impact of such comorbid disorders is not clear, with some studies reporting no impact ( ), while others report significantly poorer outcome in the presence of comorbidity ( ,  ). Another issue is whether this purely affects an individual's general psychosocial functioning or if it has an effect on the pathology of AN ( ,  ,  ). 

Research in psychosocial functioning has shown higher levels of alexithymia ( ,  ,  ), social anhedonia ( ) and poor work and social adjustment ( ) in AN compared to healthy controls (HC). Previous experimental studies assessing emotion processing have found that individuals with AN show poor emotion recognition and are slower to respond in emotion identification tasks ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). These results are not fully conclusive, as other earlier studies using similar experimental paradigms don't match these findings ( ,  ). One of the possible confounding factors in these observations is the high comorbidity of AN with affective disorders, which have also been associated with impaired emotion processing ( ,  ). Previous studies using facial expression processing tasks (FEPT) have attributed the differences in accuracy and misclassifications in AN to self-reported levels of depression ( ), obsessive compulsive symptoms ( ) and anxiety ( ). 

The onset of AN often occurs during adolescence ( ), a developmental period associated with changes in social cognition which is paralleled with changes in brain regions associated with social function ( ).   proposed a   Social Information Processing Network   (SIPN) which is made up of three basic nodes; a detecting node, an affective node and a cognitive-regulatory node. Disturbances in the   affective node   (amygdala, hypothalamus, ventral striatum, septum, orbitofrontal cortex and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) and the   cognitive-regulatory node   (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and ventral prefrontal cortex) during adolescence could lead to mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. The   detecting node   (fusiform face area, superior temporal sulcus and anterior temporal lobe), which is already mature before adolescence, has been linked to early developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) ( ,  ,  ). Previous behavioural literature has suggested similarities in the psychosocial profiles of AN and ASD ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and   hypothesised that, similarly to what happens in ASD, a hyperactive amygdala may mediate hypoactivation of the fusiform gyrus and of the superior temporal sulcus in AN, leading to a social attentional bias   away   from faces (i.e. avoidance of emotional experience ( ,  ,  )). This would express itself in the avoidance of faces ( ,  ,  ,  ) as well as in the absence of congruent facial expressions ( ). However, other studies have either not found this bias ( ), or actually reported an attentional bias   to   facial expressions ( ,  ). 

Functional and structural neuroimaging studies have reported alterations in the   detecting node   ( ,  ,  ) and   reported disrupted functional connectivity in AN in the ventral stream of visual processing. However, none of these studies focused on psychosocial functioning in AN. Recently, recovered AN patients were found to show no significant difference in activation in the fusiform gyrus or in the amygdala to sad or happy facial expressions ( ). This might suggest that alterations in these regions during emotion processing are state dependent and only present during illness. 

To date, most studies of psychosocial functioning in AN patients have revealed impaired performance and neuroimaging studies have reported both functional and structural changes in regions implicated within the SIPN. However, there is no literature on the underlying brain activity associated with the processing of social signals in ill state. Furthermore, the question remains whether or not the impairment is solely attributable to the pathology of AN, or if it is linked to commonly present comorbid disorders. The aim of this study was thus to assess the neural correlates of implicit emotion processing in AN using a whole-brain approach. Additionally, we explored the effects of confounding factors, such as comorbidity within the affective spectrum and psychotropic medication, on emotion processing in AN. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
A total of sixty-six female participants took part in this study. Thirty-one individuals with a current diagnosis of AN according to DSM-IV criteria were recruited from the hospital and community services of the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) National Health Service Trust and from an online advertisement on the b-eat website (Beating Eating Disorders — ), the UK's largest eating disorder charity (inpatients = 9, outpatients = 8, daycare patients = 7, community = 7). Twenty-five (81%) were diagnosed as restrictive (AN-R) and six (19%) as binge-purging (AN-BP). Fourteen (45%) reported taking antidepressant (SSRI = 12, SNRI = 1) or anti-anxiety medication. Thirty-five age-matched healthy individuals with no personal or family history of eating disorders were recruited from the community, staff and students of the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. Two healthy participants were excluded from further analysis due to currently taking antidepressant medication and two were excluded for optimal matching of the two groups in terms of age and IQ. Body mass index  , medication, age of onset and duration of illness were obtained on the day of testing. The screening module of the research version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM disorders (SCID-I/P) ( ) was used as a screening tool for the healthy controls (HC). The National Adult Reading Test (NART) was used to estimate IQ ( ). Participants consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki (BMJ 1991; 302: 1194) and was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee London Bentham (11-LO-0952). 


### Clinical measures 
  
All participants completed a range of questionnaires before attending the scanning session to assess levels of anxiety, depression, eating disorder-related behaviour, obsessive compulsive symptoms and social anhedonia. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) ( ) consists of 14 items used to assess the overall severity of depression and anxiety. Its performance in screening for anxiety and depression has been proven and it has been shown to also have good case finding abilities in non-clinical populations ( ). For both subscales, a score of 10 is used as a clinical threshold. The Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) ( ) is a self-report questionnaire, consisting of 36 items, that looks at a participants' behaviour over the past 28 days, with scores ranging from 4 to 6 indicating greater clinical severity. The Obsessive–Compulsive Inventory Revised (OCI-R) ( ) is an 18-item list of first person statements that participants have to rate according to the level of distress they felt when they experienced those statements over the past month. The OCI-R has shown good internal consistency and test–retest reliability, and it is able to discriminate between OCD sufferers, anxious controls and non-anxious controls. A total score higher than 20 is used as a cut-off for optimal discrimination with non-anxious controls. The Revised Social Anhedonia Scale (R-SAS) ( ) is a 40-item list of statements that participants can either agree or disagree with, and it is widely used in psychiatric research to identify social anhedonic individuals ( ,  ,  ). A total score above the optimal cut-off score of 12 is used to identify social anhedonic individuals ( ). 


### Implicit facial emotion processing task (I-FEPT) 
  
A series of photographs of 10 different faces devoid of any gender specific details (4 males and 6 females) taken from a standardised series ( ) was used as stimuli. These faces portrayed a neutral expression (100% neutral), a prototypical happy expression (100% happy) or a morphed, mildly happy expression (50% neutral and 50% happy). All three facial expressions were presented a total of 20 times for 2 s each in the same order to all participants. Each facial expression was preceded by the other two expressions an equal amount of times to minimise any effect of the preceding facial expression on current neural response. The duration of the inter stimulus interval (ISI) ranged from 1 to 7 s (average of 3 s) and was fixed according to a Poisson distribution to prevent participants from predicting the onset of the next stimulus. Participants used a joystick to specify the gender of the face during each presentation, and they were asked to focus on a fixation cross during the ISI. Stimuli were projected on a rear-projection screen and participants could view the screen via a prism attached to the head coil. 


### Image acquisition 
  
Magnetic resonance imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE Signa HDx TwinSpeed MRI scanner (GE-Medical Systems, Wisconsin) at the Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. The body coil was used for radio frequency (RF) transmission, with an 8 channel head coil for RF reception. A high resolution EPI scan, to be used for fMRI data normalisation, was acquired at 43 near-axial 3 mm thick slices parallel to the anterior commissure–posterior commissure (AC–PC) line (echo time 40 ms, repetition time 3000 ms, flip angle 90°, in-plane voxel size 1.88 mm, inter-slice gap .3 mm, field of view 240 mm, matrix size 128 × 128 pixels). T2*-weighted gradient echo EPI images depicting blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast were acquired at 25 near-axial slices, 5 mm thick, parallel to the AC–PC line (echo time 40 ms, repetition time 2000 ms, flip angle 70°, in-plane voxel size 3.75 mm, inter-slice gap .5 mm, field of view 240 mm, matrix size 64 × 64 pixels). A total of 180 T2*-weighted whole brain volumes were acquired for each participant. Data quality was assured using an automated quality control procedure ( ). 


### Behavioural data analysis 
  
Demographic, clinical and performance data were analysed using IBM SPSS version 20 (IBM  ). Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Where data were normally distributed, the Student t-test was used to examine between-group differences. For non-normal data, the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test was used. With regard to correlations, Pearson's   r   was used for normally distributed data and Spearman's rho (ρ) otherwise. 

Due to multicollinearity amongst self-report measures, a principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to find a subset of the questionnaires that was uncorrelated with each other to control for comorbidities. Bartlett's test of sphericity, Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy, and whether each variable showed at least a medium-sized correlation with at least one other variable were used to test the PCA assumptions. Components with an eigenvalue greater than one were selected. 


### Neuroimaging data analysis 
  
Imaging data were analysed with XBAM version 4.1 ( ), a non-parametric fMRI software package developed at the King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry ( ). Data were first processed to minimise motion related artefacts ( ) and, following spatial realignment, images were smoothed with an 8.83 mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian filter. 

Responses to each condition were then detected by time-series analysis using a linear model in which each component of the experimental design was convolved separately with a pair of Gamma Variate kernels (λ = 4 and 8 s) to allow for variability in the haemodynamic delay. The best fit between the weighted sum of these convolutions and the time-series at each voxel was computed using the constrained BOLD effect model ( ). A goodness of fit statistic was then computed as the ratio of the sum of squares of deviations from the mean image intensity resulting from the model (over the whole time-series) to the sum of squares of deviations resulting from the residuals (SSQ ratio). 

Following computation of the observed SSQ ratio at each voxel, the data were permuted by the wavelet-based method described in  . The observed and permuted SSQ ratio maps for each individual were then transformed into the standard space of  , using a two-stage warping procedure ( ). Group maps of activated voxels were then computed using the median SSQ ratio at each voxel (over all individuals) in the observed and permuted maps ( ). Computing intra and inter participant variations constitute a mixed effect approach, which is desirable in fMRI. The detection of activated regions was extended from voxel to 3D cluster-level using the method described by  . 

Comparisons of responses between-groups at each condition and comparisons of responses between-conditions for each group separately were performed by fitting the data at each intracerebral voxel at which all participants have non-zero data using the linear model where ‘Y’ is the vector of SSQ ratios for each individual, ‘X’ is the contrast matrix for the inter-group/inter-condition contrast, ‘a’ is the mean effect across all individuals in the groups/conditions, ‘b’ is the computed group/condition difference and ‘e’ is a vector of residual errors. The model is fitted by minimising the sum of absolute deviations to reduce outlier effects. The null distribution of ‘b’ is computed by permuting data between-groups/conditions, refitting the above model a maximum of 50 times at each voxel, and combining the data over all intracerebral voxels. To contrast the different facial expressions, linear and quadratic trends for emotion intensity were fitted at each voxel for all individuals in the two groups and the same process of wavelet-based resampling to derive the observed and null distributions was performed. A linear trend was fitted to identify voxels that demonstrate an increase in activation for increasing emotion intensity (happy > mildly happy > neutral). A quadratic trend (happy > mildly happy > neutral) was fitted to validate the linear relation of the response to the increasing emotional intensities. Using the derived null distribution, all resulting 3D cluster-level maps were then thresholded in such a way as to yield less than one expected type I error cluster per map. 



## Results 
  
### Clinical measures 
  
There was a significant difference between the AN and HC mean scores on the EDE-Q, the OCI-R, the R-SAS and the HADS (p < 0.05), as depicted in  . On the EDE-Q, 83.9% of the AN group scored above the optimal point for distinguishing between HC and cases of AN (> 2.80). Within this group, 51.6% had a score lower than four on the EDE-Q. For the OCI-R, the proportion of individuals in the AN group with a total score higher than twenty-one was 48.4%. Across the AN group, 53.3% had a score above twelve on the R-SAS. For the HADS depression (HADS_D) and anxiety (HADS_A) subscales, 51.6% and 87.1% respectively, had a score of ten or higher.

### Principal component analysis 
  
Principal component analysis revealed a single component with an eigenvalue greater than one. This component contained all five questionnaires and reflects a greater amount of general clinical symptoms, thereby excluding the possibility of covarying separate clinical measures ( ).

### Behavioural measures 
  
Both groups showed high accuracy on gender decision in the implicit facial expression recognition task and there was a significant difference between the two (see  ). The AN patients were slower on the task across all conditions and there was no significant difference in reaction time to the different emotions within both groups.

To assess whether the differences were due to medication, the AN group was divided into two subgroups depending on the presence of psychotropic medication (Supplementary Table 1). There was no significant difference in reaction time for all three facial expressions, but those taking psychotropic medication (AN-M) were less accurate (91.6%) than those not taking medication (AN-NM) (97.5%) and this difference was significant (U = 56.5, z = − 2.504, p = 0.012). 


### Neuroimaging results 
  
#### Linear trend analysis 
  
Linear trends were fitted to assess regions that expressed an increase in activation to an increase in emotional intensity in facial expressions (happy > mildly happy > neutral). A group x condition interaction was found, showing greater activation in the right fusiform gyrus, extending into the occipital lobe, in AN compared to HC ( a,  ).

Post-hoc comparisons were made in which each facial expression was contrasted with a low-level baseline (fixation cross) and between-group comparisons (AN vs. HC) were made for each facial expression. 


#### Neutral facial expressions 
  
Individuals with AN demonstrated greater activation in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, left postcentral gyrus and bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus whereas HC showed greater activation in the right lingual gyrus extending into the posterior cingulate gyrus during presentation of neutral facial expressions ( b,  ). 


#### Mildly happy facial expressions 
  
The HC group had greater activation in the posterior cingulate gyrus (extending into the cuneus and lingual gyrus) while the AN group showed greater activation in the bilateral fusiform gyrus (extending into the middle occipital cortex) and left postcentral gyrus ( c,  ). 


#### Prototypical happy facial expressions 
  
During prototypical happy facial expressions the AN group showed greater activation in the right fusiform gyrus and the left precentral gyrus compared to HC ( d,  ). No regions were found to be significant for the reverse contrast. 


#### Exploratory effects of medication 
  
The initial trend analysis was repeated within the AN group to assess the effects of medication and a linear increase in activation was found in the left postcentral gyrus ( a,  ), but not the fusiform gyrus, in AN-NM (n = 14) compared to AN-M (n = 14).

To further assess the effect of medication, a trend analysis was performed both between AN-M (n = 14) and HC (n = 14) as well as between AN-NM (n = 17) and HC (n = 17) using a subset of HC optimally matched based on age and IQ (Supplementary Table 2). The initial comparison showed a linear increase in activation in the left postcentral gyrus in HC compared to AN-M ( b,  ). The second comparison showed a linear increase in the right fusiform gyrus in AN-NM compared to HC ( c,  ). 




## Discussion 
  
The aim of this study was to assess implicit emotion processing in AN using facial expressions along the neutral–happy continuum. Previous studies have reported impairments in emotion processing in AN using questionnaires and discrimination paradigms measuring accuracy and reaction time ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ;), but this is the first study using functional neuroimaging to measure implicit emotion processing in current patients with AN. 

Our findings consistently revealed greater activation in AN vs. HC in the fusiform gyrus across all three conditions, which increased along the neutral–happy continuum. This would suggest that alterations in implicit emotion processing occur during early perceptual processing of social signals within the   detection node   of the SIPN ( ) before any social evaluative processes occur in the   affective   and   cognitive-regulatory node  . If we assume that the strength of the BOLD response in this region is an indicator of the salience of the stimulus then this would suggest that individuals with AN are more attentive to facial expressions than HC. Greater activation in the fusiform gyrus in AN has been reported in body image studies as a sign of greater saliency ( ,  ) and taken together this could suggest that, compared to HC, individuals with AN are more engaged in the task. A study by   found an increased startle response in AN to body and food stimuli, but also to pictures depicting positive stimuli. Similarly,   reported slower responses to an Emotional Stroop Task in AN, that was not found when using non-social stimuli. However, the aforementioned study focused on angry facial expressions and did not use any positive stimuli. 

It should be noted that greater activation of the fusiform gyrus has been associated with time spent fixating on facial expressions in ASD ( ). Additionally, a study by  , using eye-tracking, reported that the AN group avoid viewing faces and the eyes, similar to what ASD patients do. However, as there was no indication of a linear increase in time spent fixating on the facial expressions of increasing emotion intensity before giving a response it is unlikely that this was driving the increase in BOLD signal. 

Though   suggested that, when using a facial expression recognition task, psychotropic medication might play a role in reaction time, there was no significant difference in reaction time in the AN group between individuals currently taking psychotropic medication and individuals without medication. However, there was a significant difference in accuracy as AN-NM showed higher accuracy. While there was no difference found within AN (AN-NM vs. AN-M) in the right fusiform gyrus, upon contrasting AN-M with HC there was no indication of a greater BOLD response in AN. As AN-NM does show this increase it is likely that AN-NM was the cause of the greater BOLD response in AN. This might suggests that psychotropic medication ‘normalises’ the BOLD response in AN-M. 

Structural brain alterations have frequently been reported in AN, including the regions found in this study ( ), and changes in neurovascular coupling could bias the interpretation of signal changes ( ). While there are no studies on the effect of brain atrophy on the BOLD response in AN, studies in other clinical populations have reported a positive correlation between atrophy and BOLD activation that differs from normal degeneration ( ,  ). Therefore it is uncertain whether these changes actually imply an increase in neural activation, and thus either a prolonged gaze fixation or greater saliency, or if it is an overestimation of the BOLD response due to atrophy. Both groups perform similarly in terms of gender judgement and it is possible that AN may require more resources (cerebral blood flow) in order to perform near the level of HC. Additionally,   found reduced functional connectivity in the fusiform gyrus within the ventral visual network in AN, and this too could play a role in explaining the functional alterations seen here. 

PCA revealed that the questionnaires used in this study measure a general level of clinical symptoms present in AN, and that they cannot be used separately to try and control for comorbid disorders. Previous studies have used self-report measures as predictors of performance on emotion processing paradigms in AN ( ,  ,  ,  ), but all with different outcomes. While it is possible that the strong correlations between these measures are solely present in the current study, it is important that future studies carefully consider their use as a predictive measure for performance. 

To date, this is the first study to assess emotion processing in currently ill AN. The results presented here contribute to a neglected area of research into positive emotions in eating disorders and illustrate a difference in neural processing that occurs during the earlier stages of social perception and increases with the emotional intensity. This is distinct from the ASD neuroimaging literature, where a hypoactive fusiform gyrus in response to facial expressions is commonly reported ( ,  ,  ). Likewise, previous neuroimaging studies in depression have found a negative correlation between symptom severity and the magnitude of activation in the fusiform gyrus to positive emotions ( ,  ,  ). Associations between neural activation during emotion processing and trait-anxiety have been found in the insula and amygdala, but not in the fusiform gyrus ( ,  ).   did report significantly greater activation in face-processing regions, including the fusiform gyrus, in OCD patients that increased with symptom severity, but this finding has not been replicated using an implicit emotion processing task. 

In conclusion, our results demonstrated increased BOLD fMRI response in the fusiform gyrus to facial expressions with increasing positive emotional intensity (happiness). This suggests that, in AN, emotionally happy facial expressions are more salient than in HC and this difference remains consistent for facial expressions along the neutral–happy continuum. Additionally, it seems that psychotropic medication does play a role in implicit emotion processing in AN patients. Those taking medication did not show the same changes in the fusiform gyrus compared to HC and demonstrated poorer accuracy on the task. It is important to note, that the BMI of the AN sample is quite ‘high’ compared to the AN population and this might explain why medication does seem to have some effects in this sample. Our stringent statistical approach employed alongside the largest AN cohort to date makes a strong argument for the findings presented here, but future studies should aim to replicate these findings and assess the role of brain atrophy on the BOLD response in AN. Additionally, future studies of those at risk of developing AN are required to detect possible alterations in the   affective   and the   cognitive-regulatory node   of the SIPN ( ) during development. Further empirical studies exploring emotion processing as well as expression are also required in our endeavour to translate such research findings to clinical practice. 


## Limitations 
  
As the findings presented here are limited to positive emotions (happiness), it is unknown whether other emotions, such as anger, fear or sadness, elicit a similar response in AN, or if the findings presented here are specific for positive emotions. It is interesting to note that when   investigated both happy and sad facial expressions in recovered AN, they found no functional differences compared to HC, suggesting that similarly to AN brain atrophy, these alterations could be reversible. 

While post-hoc analysis did not reveal bilateral activation during prototypical happy facial expressions, we hypothesise that changes are present but do not reach significance within our data. This could be due to different temporal patterns of activation in the left and right fusiform gyrus ( ) to facial stimuli that are not optimally captured by event-related modelling of the neural response. 

Furthermore, the demonstrated multicollinearity of the questionnaires used here illustrates the caveats to using multiple self-report measures to control for confounding factors in psychiatric disorders with a broad spectrum of comorbidities. Future studies should aim to enforce more rigorous recruitment to aim for more homogenous samples. Additionally, the current sample consisted mostly of the AN-R subtype and it is possible that these results are limited to AN-R. Further research on the differences between AN-R and AN-BP is required either by restricting recruitment to one subtype or by matching AN-R and AN-BP for additional analyses. It is also possible that conducting fMRI at higher field strengths would increase the likelihood of finding subtle differences in regions known to be elusive at lower field strength, such as the amygdala ( ). 

Finally, as the presence of medication seems to ‘normalise’ the BOLD response in AN it is therefore vital that future studies not only take these effects into account, but also perhaps delve deeper into the efficacy of psychotropic medication on emotion processing.

# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is thought to involve deficits in emotion regulation, and more specifically, deficits in cognitive reappraisal. However, evidence for such deficits is mixed. 


## Methods 
  
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal, we examined reappraisal-related behavioral and neural responses in 27 participants with generalized SAD and 27 healthy controls (HC) during three socio-emotional tasks: (1) looming harsh faces (Faces); (2) videotaped actors delivering social criticism (Criticism); and (3) written autobiographical negative self-beliefs (Beliefs). 


## Results 
  
Behaviorally, compared to HC, participants with SAD had lesser reappraisal-related reduction in negative emotion in the Beliefs task. Neurally, compared to HC, participants with SAD had lesser BOLD responses in reappraisal-related brain regions when reappraising faces, in visual and attention related regions when reappraising criticism, and in the left superior temporal gyrus when reappraising beliefs. Examination of the temporal dynamics of BOLD responses revealed late reappraisal-related increased responses in HC, compared to SAD. In addition, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), which showed reappraisal-related increased activity in both groups, had similar temporal dynamics in SAD and HC during the Faces and Criticism tasks, but greater late response increases in HC, compared to SAD, during the Beliefs task. Reappraisal-related greater late DMPFC responses were associated with greater percent reduction in negative emotion ratings in SAD patients. 


## Conclusions 
  
These results suggest a dysfunction of cognitive reappraisal in SAD patients, with overall reduced late brain responses in prefrontal regions, particularly when reappraising faces. Decreased late activity in the DMPFC might be associated with deficient reappraisal and greater negative reactivity.

## Background 
  
Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by heightened anxiety in a wide array of social situations [ ]. It has been suggested that these elevated levels of anxiety may be due to ineffective emotion regulation [ ]. Specifically, it has been suggested that patients with SAD use adaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as cognitive reappraisal, less frequently than non-anxious healthy adults [ ]. In healthy individuals, cognitive reappraisal, which involves changing the meaning of a stimulus that gives rise to an emotion, can modify emotional reactions to anxiety-provoking situations, leading to greater psychological flexibility and emotional well being [ ]. In SAD, deficits in cognitive reappraisal are thought to be related to difficulty in modifying the negative thoughts that arise before, during, and after social evaluative situations [ ]. 

### Neuroimaging findings 
  
One source of evidence regarding reappraisal in SAD comes from neuroimaging studies. To date, three studies have investigated the neural correlates of cognitive reappraisal in SAD. In the first study, Goldin and colleagues examined cognitive reappraisal of social (harsh facial expressions) and physical (violent scenes) threat in SAD patients and healthy controls. Regulation during social threat, but not physical threat, was associated with diminished recruitment of brain systems implicated in cognitive reappraisal (dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC)), and attention modulation (medial cuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and parietal cortex) in SAD, compared to healthy controls [ ]. 

In a second study by this group, using negative self-beliefs, the temporal dynamics of the BOLD response, in addition to its signal magnitude, were analyzed [ ]. Findings revealed greater early activity in healthy controls during reappraisal of negative self-beliefs in brain networks implicated in reappraisal (dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and ventrolateral PFC), language (left inferior frontal gyrus), and visual (precuneus, inferior parietal) processing, while SAD patients had greater late responses in dorsomedial and ventrolateral PFC, insula, and visual processing regions. Taken together, these two studies suggest a failure to recruit reappraisal-related prefrontal regions in SAD. This differential activity of prefrontal regulatory regions in SAD has been observed in other neuroimaging studies [ - ]. 

The third study that explicitly addressed the neural correlates of emotion regulation in SAD, by Bruhl and colleagues [ ], reported results that are discrepant with the two studies reported above. In this study, patients were instructed either to perform ‘reality checking’ or to simply anticipate and then look at negative, positive, and neutral pictures. Thus, in contrast to the first two studies, which compared patients to healthy controls, this study compared patients applying cognitive control with patients not using cognitive control. The authors found regulation-related reduced activity in emotion reactivity regions (amygdala, insula, thalamus), and in the dorsolateral PFC and cingulated cortex, with no regions with increased activity due to cognitive control. 


### Explaining mixed findings 
  
One possible explanation for the mixed findings may be the different contexts that were examined. Each of these studies focused on only one emotional probe: faces, beliefs, or non-socially specific affective pictures. However, in the SAD literature, it has been shown that the choice of emotional probes and experimental paradigms has a much larger effect on the results of fMRI investigations than is typically thought [ ]. 

In addition to using different stimuli, another source of variability in the imaging literature is the different data analytic approaches used in each study. The majority of studies in SAD so far have used BOLD signal magnitude analyses that usually collapse across time. Only a handful of studies examined the temporal dynamics of the BOLD responses [ , - ]. Of these studies, only one [ ] has specifically focused on emotion regulation processes. Analysis of BOLD signal temporal dynamics can reveal information that might be hidden when averaging across time. It can also reveal between-group differences in brain regions that have the same averaged response among two groups, such as a pattern of early brain responses in one group, or delayed responses in the other group. Indeed, the one study examining temporal dynamics of emotion regulation processes in SAD found delayed BOLD signal onset in the dorsomedial and ventrolateral PFC regions in patients, relatively to healthy controls [ ]. 


### The present study 
  
The goal of the present study was to examine behavioral and fMRI BOLD responses in patients with SAD compared to healthy controls (HC) when reappraising socio-emotional stimuli. To test whether emotion dysregulation in SAD is related to a specific socio-emotional stimulus, or whether this is a more general core deficit, three contexts were compared: (1) looming harsh faces (Faces); (2) dynamic video clips of actors delivering social criticism (Criticism); and (3) written autobiographical social anxiety-related negative self-beliefs (Beliefs). To our knowledge, no study has directly tested reappraisal-related BOLD responses in patients with SAD across several distinct socio-emotional tasks that vary in both content and form. 

Behaviorally, we hypothesized that, compared to HC, patients with SAD would be less successful in down regulating negative emotional reactivity when implementing cognitive reappraisal in each of the three tasks. Neurally, we hypothesized that, compared to HC, patients with SAD would have: (1) lesser BOLD responses in reappraisal-related PFC regions; and (2) delayed (that is, late) BOLD responses in reappraisal-related PFC regions. In addition to analyzing the differential and common BOLD responses separately for each task, we examined BOLD signal temporal dynamics in regions showing similar reappraisal-related increased activity in SAD and HC across all three tasks. The purpose of this analysis was to see whether there are cognitive reappraisal-related brain responses that are stimulus-independent, and whether more refined timing differences in patients and HC could be revealed using analyses of the BOLD signal temporal dynamics. 



## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
This study was part of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD, and data from participants in this RCT have been published in other baseline brain papers [ , ]. Participants included 27 (12 women) unmedicated (minimum of three months since stopping pharmacotherapy) adults who met   DSM-IV-TR  [ ] criteria for primary generalized SAD and 27 (13 women) HC with no lifetime history of psychiatric disorders (Table  ). As reported in Ziv et al. [ ], patients were recruited through clinician referrals and advertisements on community and online bulletin boards. Two PhD-level clinical psychologists assessed each potential participant using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for   DSM-IV-TR Lifetime version (ADIS-IV-L  ) [ ]  .   Only patients who met clinical diagnostic criteria for a principal diagnosis of current generalized SAD (defined as greater than moderate anxiety/fear for five or more distinct social situations) or HC with no current or past history of DSM-IV disorders were eligible for participation.

Patients and HC did not differ significantly in age or years of education (see Table  ). All participants were right-handed as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ]. Potential patients were excluded if they reported current pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, history of neurological disorders, and current psychiatric disorders (other than SAD, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia without a history of panic attacks, dysthymia, or specific phobia). HC were not permitted to meet criteria for any current or past psychiatric disorders. 

Among patients, current Axis-I co-morbidity included two with panic attacks, two with generalized anxiety disorder, two with dysthymia, and two with specific phobia. Past Axis-I co-morbidity included six with major depression, one with post-traumatic stress disorder, four with substance abuse, and one with eating disorder. Thirteen patients reported past (that is, ended >1 year ago) non-cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, and seven reported past pharmacotherapy. The study was approved by the Stanford Medical Research Institutional Review Board (Protocol ID #79403). All participants provided informed consent in accordance with Stanford University Human Subjects Committee rules. 


### Clinical assessment 
  
To assess social anxiety symptom severity, participants completed the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self-Report (LSAS-SR) [ ]. This questionnaire assesses both fear and behavioral avoidance of social situations, and is widely used in the research of SAD [ ]. 

To provide greater sensitivity, from 67 patients who were eligible for the study, we selected a subgroup of 27 SAD patients with the highest social anxiety symptom severity (range of LSAS-SR scores for the whole group: 66–102; and for the subgroup: 85–102). We compared this SAD subgroup to a group of 27 healthy controls. 


### Experimental tasks 
  
The three fMRI tasks have been described previously by Ziv et al. [ ]. The tasks were composed of ‘React’ and ‘Reappraise’ conditions. Prior to scanning, participants were trained in how to react and to reappraise with stimuli not used in the MR scanner tasks. The instructions for the ‘React’ condition were to react normally without any attempt to control, modify, or regulate any reactions. During the ‘Reappraise’ condition, participants were instructed to try and down regulate negative emotion reactions by actively reinterpreting the meaning of the emotion inducing stimulus. We used reappraisal methods developed by Ochsner et al. [ ]. 

After each trial, participants provided a negative emotion rating using a button response pad positioned in the participant’s right hand inside the magnet by responding to ‘How negative do you feel?’ (1 = not at all to 5 = very much). All tasks were programmed in Eprime (Psychology Software Tools, Inc.). 

#### Faces task 
  
This task consisted of 24 trials during which the participants viewed color photos of faces displaying Ekman facial action coded anger and contempt facial expressions [ ]. Each trial consisted of a cue (Look or Reframe) lasting 1.5 s, a single harsh facial stimulus presented in color and appearing to move closer to the participant to simulate looming (every 3 s over a total of 9 s), and a negative emotion rating after the face stimulus terminated (3 s) (Figure  a). The length of the entire task was 516 TRs, which is 12 min and 54 s (774 s). Participants were trained prior to the baseline scan to either react to the faces by engaging in the picture (‘Just let yourself feel’) and thinking: ‘This person is upset with me; angry with me’, or to reappraise their emotion, for example by thinking: ‘Maybe this person just had a bad day’. 
  
 The three socio-emotional tasks. (a)   Looming harsh faces (Faces);   (b)   Social criticism (Criticism);   (c)   Negative self-beliefs (Beliefs). Each task was composed of ‘React’ and ‘Reappraise’ trials, which consisted of: (1) a 1.5-s ‘Cue’; (2) a socio-emotional stimulus (a looming harsh face/ a video-clip of an actor delivering social criticism/ an autobiographical sentence + negative self-beliefs); and (3) a negative emotion rating scale. Participants were instructed to either react normally to the stimuli without any attempt to control, modify, or regulate their reactions (‘React’), or to try and down regulate negative emotion reactions by actively reinterpreting the meaning of the emotion inducing stimulus (‘Reappraise’). 
  

#### Criticism task 
  
The task consisted of videotaped actors delivering social criticism and social praise and harsh or happy evaluation-congruent facial expressions (Figure  b). The stimuli were delivered by five male and five female actors (seven Anglo-Americans and three Asian-Americans), with an age range of 23 to 50 years. In each trial the participants were asked to either ‘Just Watch’ or ‘Reframe’ their reaction (1.5 s) during the social evaluation video clip (12 s). Each video clip had a 4.5-s waiting period during which the actor silently maintained a neutral facial expression followed by a 7.5-s evaluation period in which the actor delivered a social criticism or praise statement while displaying a harsh or positive facial expression. For the current study, only the 7.5-s evaluation period of the social criticism trials were included in the analysis. After each video clip, participants were cued to rate their current negative emotion (3 s). Each condition consisted of 16 trials delivered across two runs of 342 TRs, 8 min 35 s each (513 s). Participants were trained on the instructions prior to scanning. Participants were told to react to the social criticism by reflecting on how the statement represents something true about themselves, or to reappraise their emotion, for example by thinking: ‘this is not always true’, or ‘this is only a thought, not a fact’. 


#### Beliefs task 
  
This task consisted of five situations. The first was an experimenter-composed neutral situation that was used to obtain baseline emotion ratings for reading neutral statements. The neutral situation was followed by four participant-generated autobiographical social anxiety situations that were characterized by social anxiety, humiliation, and/or embarrassment. Prior to scanning session, participants composed a single paragraph describing the events, thoughts, and feelings for each situation, and provided situation-specific negative self-beliefs (NSBs). At the scanner, the participants were asked to either React to the negative self-beliefs, or to Reframe their reaction. 

Three situations were presented in a first run lasting 374 TRs, 9 min 21 s (561 s), followed by two situations in a second run of 256 TRs, 6 min 24 s (534 s). Each situation consisted of an instruction to react/reframe (1.5 s), 16 sentences (3 s each,) in white font against a black background describing the situation, 10 NSBs (9 s each) embedded in the unfolding story in uppercase letters that flashed nine times (850 ms on + 150 ms off), and a negative emotion rating after each NSB (3 s) (Figure  c). Participants were trained prior to scanning to react to the NSBs by reflecting on how the NSB represents something that is true about themselves, or to reappraise their reaction by thinking of a positive coping statement that directly challenges the thoughts (‘try to re-interpret the statement so it is less negative and toxic for you’). 



### Image acquisition 
  
Information about the fMRI image acquisition and data preprocessing have been described previously by Ziv et al. [ ]. We used a General Electric 3-T Signa magnet with a T2*-weighted gradient echo spiral-in/out pulse sequence [ ] and a custom-built quadrature ‘dome’ elliptical bird cage head-coil (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Head movements were minimized using a bite-bar and foam padding. Functional volumes (516 for faces, 684 for criticism, 630 for belief tasks) were obtained from 22 sequential axial slices (repetition time = 1500 ms, echo time = 30 ms, flip angle = 60°, field of view = 22 cm, matrix = 64 × 64, single-shot, resolution = 3.438 mm  × 4.5 mm). Three-dimensional high-resolution anatomical scans were acquired using a fast spin-echo spoiled gradient recall (resolution = 0.8594 mm  × 1.5 mm; field of view = 22 cm, frequency encoding = 256). 


### FMRI data preprocessing 
  
We used Analysis of Functional Neuroimages (AFNI) software [ ] for preprocessing and statistical analysis. Preprocessing included an analysis of potential outliers, volume registration to a base image, motion correction, 4 mm  isotropic Gaussian spatial smoothing, high-pass filtering (0.011 Hz), linear detrending, and conversion into BOLD signal percentage change in each voxel. In addition, the first four images of each functional run were excluded, to allow for T2* equilibration effects. For the Criticism and Belief tasks, the two functional runs were concatenated prior to statistical analysis. No volumes demonstrated motion in the x, y, or z directions in excess of ±1 mm. There was no evidence of stimulus-correlated motion, as assessed by correlations between condition-specific reference functions and x, y, z motion correction parameters. 


### fMRI statistical analysis 
  
Multiple-regression implemented with AFNI 3dDeconvolve included baseline parameters to remove mean, linear, and quadratic trends, and motion-related variance in the BOLD signal. Regressors for the React and Reappraise conditions were convolved with the Cohen’s gamma variate model of the hemodynamic response function [ ]. Functional MRI BOLD signal intensity was computed as percentage of signal change, an effect size measure [(MR signal per voxel per time point/mean MR signal in that voxel for the entire functional run) × 100]. 

Individual brain maps were converted to Talairach atlas space [ ] and second-level group statistical parametric maps were produced according to a random-effects model. To correct for multiple comparisons, AlphaSim, a Monte Carlo simulation bootstrapping program in the AFNI library, was used to protect against false positives [ ]. This method uses a voxel-wise and cluster volume joint-probability threshold to establish a cluster-wise false-positive cluster detection level. The cluster statistical threshold for the between-group analyses consisted of a voxel-wise   P   <0.005 and cluster volume >244 mm  (6 voxels × 3.438 mm ) to protect against false-positive cluster detection at   P   <0.01. 

To examine differential responses in BOLD signal magnitude, we conducted a whole-brain 2 Group (SAD, HC) between-group t-test of Reappraise   versus   React in SAD   versus   HC. To identify common responses, we ran a one-sample t-test of Reappraise   versus   React in SAD, and separately in HC. 

To further examine the between-group differences in the BOLD responses during reappraisal, we ran between-group t-tests for early (first three time points, 0 to 4.5 s) and late (last two/three time points, 4.5 to 7.5 s or 4.5 to 9 s) BOLD responses for the contrast of Reappraise   versus   React. This analysis was conducted in each of the brain regions showing a between-group difference, and had several sub-steps: (1) creating masks from each of the clusters surviving the threshold of the between-group t-test, separately for each task; (2) extracting the percent signal change from each of these regions, at the individual subject level, for the Reappraise condition and for the React condition; (3) calculating the percent signal change for Reappraise minus React; (4) averaging (for each subject) the percent signal change for the first three time points, and for the last three time points; and (5) running between-group t-tests (SAD   versus   HC) separately for the early and late averaged responses, for each task. 

In a secondary analysis, we examined brain regions showing BOLD responses common to SAD and HC across the three tasks, and ran between-group t-tests on the contrast of Reappraise   versus   React, for early and late responses, separately, for each task.

#### Brain responses: BOLD signal temporal dynamics 
  
To examine between-group differences in the BOLD responses during reappraisal, we conducted between-group t-tests for early (first three time points; 0–4.5 s) and late (last three time points; 4.5-9 s) BOLD responses for the Reappraise   versus   React contrast in the left IFG, dACC, and left LOFC. Between-group t-tests revealed a significantly greater late responses in HC, compared to SAD, in the left IFG (mean HC = 0.09   vs.   mean SAD = -0.03, t  = -3.70,   P   <0.0005) and the dACC (mean HC = 0.07   vs  . mean SAD = -0.11, t  = -3.26,   P   <0.002), with no between-group differences in early responses (Figures  a, b). For the left LOFC, a between-group t-test showed that, compared to SAD, HC had greater early (mean HC = 0.09   vs  . mean SAD = -0.05, t  = -2.34,   P   <0.02) and late (mean HC = 0.13   vs  . mean SAD = -0.09, t  = -5.10,   P   <0.0001) responses for the Reappraisal   versus   React contrasts (Figure  c).

#### Brain responses: temporal dynamics 
  
To examine the between-group differences in the BOLD signal timing during reappraisal, we conducted between-group t-tests for early (first three time points; 0–4.5 s) and late (last two time points; 4.5-7.5 s) BOLD responses for the Reappraise   versus   React conditions in left and right fusiform gyrus, left lingual gyrus, left putamen, and right cerebellum. 

Between-group t-tests revealed a significant greater early response in HC, compared to SAD, in the left (mean HC = 0.03   vs  . mean SAD = -0.09; t  = -2.20,   P   <0.03) and right (mean HC = 0.05   vs  . mean SAD = -0.19, t  = -2.78,   P   <0.008) fusiform gyrus. For the left lingual gyrus, there were no early or late significant between-group differences (All   Ps   > 0.26). Significant increased late response in HC, compared to SAD, was found in the left putamen (mean HC = 0.05, mean SAD = -0.05, t  = -2.88,   P   <0.006). Time course analyses for the right cerebellum showed both early (mean HC = 0.05   vs  . mean SAD = -0.15, t  = -2.32,   P   <0.03) and late (mean HC = 0.05   vs  . mean SAD = -0.15, t  = -2.22,   P   <0.03) increased responses in HC, compared to SAD, during reappraisal (Figure  a-e) .

#### Brain responses: temporal dynamics 
  
To examine between-group differences in the BOLD responses during reappraisal of beliefs, we conducted between-group t-tests for early (first three time points; 0–4.5 s) and late (last three time points; 4.5-9 s) BOLD responses for the Reappraise   versus   React conditions in the left STG. This analysis revealed a significant increased late response in HC, compared to SAD (mean HC = 0.02   vs  . mean SAD = -0.09, t  = -3.52,   P   <0.0009) (Figure  ).

### Secondary analyses 
  
Examination of the reappraisal-related brain responses common for SAD and HC revealed only one region, the dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC), which showed reappraisal-related increased activity in both groups, in all three tasks (Figure  ). To examine the temporal dynamics of the BOLD response, and its potential association with between-group differences, we conducted two between-group t-tests: one for early and one for late BOLD responses during the Reappraise   versus   React conditions in this region, separately for each task. 
  
 Dorsomedial PFC BOLD responses during the three socio-emotional tasks.   The dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) showed increased activity in both patients with SAD and HC, during reappraisal of faces, criticism, and beliefs. 
  
There were no significant between-group differences in early or late responses for the contrast of Reappraise   versus   React Faces (  P  s >0.08) and Criticism (  P  s >0.26) (Figure  a,b). However, for Beliefs, compared to HC, patients had lesser late BOLD responses (mean HC = 0.17, mean SAD = 0.07, t  = -2.12,   P   <0.04) (Figure  c).

No significant between-group differences were found in early or late DMPFC activity when reappraising faces and criticism. A significant between-group difference was found in late DMPFC activity when reappraising beliefs (P <0.04). 
  
Greater late DMPFC responses were associated with greater reduction in negative emotion ratings in SAD patients (r = 0.42,   P   <0.04), but not HC (r = -0.32,   P   = 0.13; Zdiff = 2.52,   P   <0.05) (Figure  ).

When reappraising beliefs, DMPFC BOLD responses were positively correlated with % reduction in negative emotion ratings in SAD patients (r = 0.42,   P   <0.04). 
  


## Discussion 
  
We tested the hypothesis that dysfunctional emotion regulation processes in SAD patients are associated with altered reappraisal-related activity in prefrontal brain regions. We focused on both BOLD signal magnitude and temporal dynamics during reappraisal of three different socio-emotional stimuli in patients with SAD   versus   healthy controls. Results suggest distinct behavioral and neural effects related to each of the socio-emotional tasks. 

### Behavioral correlates of reappraisal in SAD 
  
Behaviorally, the results of this study indicated a smaller percent reduction of negative emotion in patients with SAD compared to HC, but only during the reappraisal of idiographic social anxiety-related negative self-beliefs. Though it has long been thought that patients with SAD have problems with down regulating negative emotions [ , , , ], the behavioral findings in our study suggest a more nuanced picture of deficits in reappraisal. Specifically, the emotion regulation deficits were most pronounced when facing the negative self-beliefs. These idiographic stimuli, each linked to autobiographical social anxiety-related situations, are highly potent - in our previous report [ ], using the same stimuli and the same sample, negative self-beliefs were associated with the greatest increase in negative emotion, compared to faces and criticism, in both SAD and HC. This suggests greater emotional effect for these stimuli, which might be related with the difficulty in down regulating its associated negative emotions. 

Our finding is partially in line with the results of the one other study examining cognitive regulation of negative self-beliefs in SAD [ ]. In that study, although no difference was found between patients and controls in the amount of reappraisal-related reduction of negative emotion, greater social anxiety symptom severity was associated with lesser down regulation of negative emotion in patients, suggesting that severity of social anxiety contributes to deficits in cognitive reappraisal of negative beliefs. 


### Neural correlates of reappraisal in SAD 
  
Neurally, based on the prior findings in patients with SAD [ , ] and non-clinical populations [ ], we hypothesized that, relative to HC, patients would have reduced recruitment of PFC regions during reappraisal. The between-group analyses partially confirmed our hypothesis. While there was PFC activation during reappraisal in both patients and controls during all three tasks, between-group differential PFC activation was found only during the reappraisal of faces, with no differential PFC responses when reappraising beliefs and criticism. 

#### Reappraisal of looming harsh faces 
  
When reappraising faces, compared to HC, patients had reduced activity in a PFC network that included left IFG, dACC, and lateral OFC. In these regions, time course analyses revealed greater BOLD response during the second half of the trial in HC compared to patients. This increased late responses in HC when reappraising looming harsh faces might be related to integrated cognitive processes that rely on linguistic (left IFG), cognitive control/attention (dACC), and evaluation/response selection (lateral OFC) processes [ ]. In patients, the reduced late recruitment of prefrontal regulatory brain regions suggests deficits in reappraisal processes, especially of faces displaying contempt, anger, or disapproval. The use of harsh faces as an emotional probe in patients with SAD has ecological validity given that SAD is characterized by fear of interpersonal situations and a tendency to avoid eye contact [ ]. Cognitive behavioral models of social anxiety suggest that patients with SAD manifest increased attentional focus on others’ facial expressions and negative evaluation during social situations [ ]. Supporting the models, behavioral studies have reported that patients with SAD tend to remember critical faces better than accepting ones [ ], and scan faces with a different pattern of eye movements than is used by healthy controls [ ]. The results of the current study accord with these models of social anxiety and extend the current theory by suggesting a delayed regulatory deficit in SAD. 


#### Reappraisal of social criticism 
  
During reappraisal of criticism, the left putamen exhibited increased reappraisal-related activity in HC, compared to SAD, during the second half of the trials. Previous studies implicated the putamen as involved in implicit learning, and specifically in prediction of future reward [ ]. Recently, the left putamen was shown to be active when participants had to explicitly mirror observed emotional facial expressions [ ]. The authors of this study suggested that the putamen is involved in the establishment of a successful social connection with another person. In the current study, it might be that HC, but not patients, were able to form a relatively more positive (or less negative) interpretation of the social feedback delivered by the actor following the reappraisal instruction. For patients with SAD, difficulties implementing cognitive reappraisal might make it harder for them to relate to the person in the video clip in a positive way, and prevent them from seeing the social situation as a potential rewarding event. 

Interestingly, time course analyses of the fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, and cerebellum responses revealed that the between-group differences derived less from increased reappraisal-related responses in HC, and more from increased reactivity-related responses in patients with SAD. These results are in line with electrophysiological studies demonstrating early hyper-vigilance followed by attentional avoidance in adults with SAD when facing social threat stimuli [ ]. Overall, this result confirms previous findings of increased activity in visual attention-related regions in SAD when reacting to social relevant stimuli [ ]. 


#### Reappraisal of autobiographical negative self-beliefs 
  
During reappraisal of beliefs, the between-group results indicated increased reappraisal-related activity in the left STG in healthy controls. The STG also manifested a late activity peak for HC, compared to SAD. The STG is related to social cognition, namely, the ability to attribute mental states to the self and others. During cognitive reappraisal, attending to one’s own emotional state or to those of others is crucial to be able to monitor the process of changing the affective state [ ]. Thus, greater activity in this region in HC, compared to patients, might be associated with the patients’ reduced ability to regulate their cognitions when facing their self-created negative self-beliefs. 



### Temporal dynamics of reappraisal 
  
Across the three tasks, the results of the temporal dynamics analyses converged, showing greater reappraisal-related neural responses in HC, compared to SAD, during the late reappraisal period. In the one previous paper that examined the temporal dynamics of neural responses during reappraisal, findings indicated greater reappraisal-related neural responses in HC, compared to HC, during the early reappraisal period [ ]. That study utilized one of the three tasks reported in the current paper (negative self-beliefs) and tested reappraisal processes using similar reappraisal training methods. However, while the current study focused on between-group effects of the contrast of reappraise   versus   react, separately in the early and late responses, the goal of the previous study was to examine linear decreases in emotional reactivity and increases in regulatory responses during the whole 9-s trial. Thus, the previous study used linear regression to examine linear changes in BOLD responses over time, and compared early   versus   late BOLD responses on each trial, separately for reappraise and for react, in SAD compared to HC. In the present study, we ran between-group t-tests for early and late responses separately, but contrasted the reappraise and react conditions. In addition to these differences in data analytic approaches, the previous study examined one task, while three different contexts were tested in the current paper. Despite these dissimilarities, the results of both studies clearly suggest different timing of the brain responses in SAD and HC during reappraisal. The idea that differences in the temporal dynamics of the brain response are a key factor in regulation processes is consistent with recent findings by Goldin and colleagues, who showed changes in the timing of the BOLD responses in patients with SAD following an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program, and following 16 sessions of individual CBT for SAD [ ]. 


### Task independent reappraisal responses 
  
For each task separately, examination of reappraisal-related BOLD responses common to patients and HC revealed a task-specific network of regions. These regions are implicated in visual attention (cuneus, precuneus, lingual gyrus), working memory (dorsolateral PFC), cognitive regulation (dorsomedial PFC), memory (hippocampus), and language (left MTG, left precentral gyrus) processes, which all take part during reappraisal. Of these regions, the dorsomedial PFC was the only region showing increased activity for both HC and patients during all three tasks. 

The DMPFC has been implicated in multiple cognitive functions, including strategic evaluation, introspection, and decision-making [ - ]. In the present study, though no group differences in DMPFC BOLD signal magnitude were found, time course analyses revealed increased late DMPFC activity in healthy controls, compared to SAD patients, when reappraising negative self-beliefs. This finding accords well with the study by Bruhl and colleagues [ ], which found comparable MPFC activity in SAD patients who applied reality-checking to negative stimuli and in SAD patients who just perceived the stimuli with no regulation attempts. The researchers suggested that the lack of increased recruitment of MPFC activity due to cognitive control might point to deficits in emotion regulation processes in SAD. 

This idea that the lack of additional recruitment of MPFC could be an important neural correlate of emotion regulation deficits in SAD is supported by the results of the current study, and more specifically by the convergence between the neural and behavioral findings: compared to SAD, HC manifested both greater late DMPFC activity, and greater percent reduction in negative emotion ratings, when reappraising negative self-beliefs. In addition, in patients with SAD, greater late DMPFC responses were associated with greater reduction in negative emotion ratings. Thus, decreased DMPFC activity in SAD might be associated with reduced emotion regulation capability, and consequently to reduced ability to down regulate negative reactivity. 



## Conclusions 
  
The present study found reduced late BOLD responses in PFC regions in SAD, compared to healthy controls, when reappraising harsh faces. In addition, reduced late responses in the DMPFC in patients with SAD, compared to controls, were related to less reduction in negative emotion ratings when reappraising negative self-beliefs. Together, these results suggest deficient cognitive reappraisal processes in SAD. Importantly, these results indicate that probes with different stimulus dimensions (visual/linguistic, static/dynamic, general/idiographic) are associated with different reappraisal-related behavioral and brain responses. While reappraisal of faces was associated with increased prefrontal activity in HC when compared to patients with SAD, but with no between-group behavioral effects, reappraisal of beliefs was associated with less ability to down regulate negative emotions in patients, compared to HC, with much less robust between-group neural differences. It is important for future research to specifically examine which of these stimulus dimensions could be the most informative in studying reappraisal processes in SAD. 

The results of this study suggest that when cued, patients with SAD do try to implement cognitive reappraisal, but their efforts are less efficient, leading to less than optimal emotional relief. Though reappraisal training is a crucial part of CBT for SAD, our results emphasize the importance of teaching patients how to improve the effectiveness of their reappraisal efforts. Mastering more adaptive regulation processes will help patients with SAD reduce the negative emotions they experience. 

An interesting question arising from this study is whether, when no external cue exists, patients use cognitive reappraisal less frequently than healthy controls. To answer this question, future studies may examine the extent to which patients with SAD activate un-cued implicit emotion regulation, compared to healthy controls, in addition to examining the associated brain regions that are activated during implicit,   versus   explicit, emotion regulation processes. 

One possible limitation of the current study is the specificity of the stimuli that were chosen to evoke negative emotional response. Because of the social nature of these stimuli, these stimuli were probably more emotionally evocative for patients than for HC. Future studies could examine whether regulatory deficits in SAD, behaviorally and in the brain, are specific to socially-related stimuli, or whether this is a more general deficit. 

Finally, the current findings stress the importance of performing analyses that elucidate neural temporal change. Here we focused on temporal dynamics of cognitive reappraisal. However, when a patient with SAD enters a social situation, many other regulatory processes such as rumination, attention deployment, and expression suppression are activated. Although the theory suggests that distinct forms of emotion regulation have their own neural circuitry and temporal features [ ], in SAD, the temporal dynamics of the BOLD response in regulatory brain regions are still not well understood. Future studies could examine brain activity related to different regulatory processes, taking place at different points in the emotion-generative process. 


## Endnote 
  
The increased reappraisal-related activity during criticism was found in two clusters identified as the left fusiform gyrus (1. x,y,z = -24, -68, -12, voxel size = 16; 2. x,y,z = -45, -65, -16, voxel size = 6) and in three clusters identified as the right cerebellum (1. x,y,z = 3, -68, -9, voxel size = 12; 2. x,y,z = 24, -51, -16, voxel size = 7; 3. x,y,z = 17, -58, -12, voxel size = 7). All demonstrated similar pattern of temporal dynamics. For simplicity, we report here only the effects of the biggest cluster in each region (16 voxels for the left fusiform, 12 voxels for the right cerebellum).

# Abstract
 
Extinction is an important mechanism to inhibit initially acquired fear responses. There is growing evidence that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) inhibits the amygdala and therefore plays an important role in the extinction of delay fear conditioning. To our knowledge, there is no evidence on the role of the prefrontal cortex in the extinction of trace conditioning up to now. Thus, we compared brain structures involved in the extinction of human delay and trace fear conditioning in a between-subjects-design in an fMRI study. Participants were passively guided through a virtual environment during learning and extinction of conditioned fear. Two different lights served as conditioned stimuli (CS); as unconditioned stimulus (US) a mildly painful electric stimulus was delivered. In the delay conditioning group (DCG) the US was administered with offset of one light (CS+), whereas in the trace conditioning group (TCG) the US was presented 4 s after CS+ offset. Both groups showed insular and striatal activation during early extinction, but differed in their prefrontal activation. The vmPFC was mainly activated in the DCG, whereas the TCG showed activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during extinction. These results point to different extinction processes in delay and trace conditioning. VmPFC activation during extinction of delay conditioning might reflect the inhibition of the fear response. In contrast, dlPFC activation during extinction of trace conditioning may reflect modulation of working memory processes which are involved in bridging the trace interval and hold information in short term memory.

## Introduction 
  
Fear serves as an alert mechanism which is vital for survival, because adaptive fear reactions enable an individual to cope with survival threats by escaping or avoiding them. However, fear reactions can become maladaptive when they are no longer appropriate to the actual situation. The ability to readjust behavior is especially important in a rapidly changing environment. In anxiety disorders, this ability usually is impaired (e.g., Rauch et al.,  ; Schiller et al.,  ). The high prevalence of anxiety disorders (~14% within 12 months; BGS98 2000) has led to extensive research in the field of fear and the neural systems involved in fear learning and its extinction. 

Fear learning in animal and human research is mainly examined on the basis of Pavlovian fear conditioning (Pavlov,  ). In this paradigm, an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS), such as a tone or a light, is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), such as a shock. After several pairings, the CS is associated with the US and evokes a conditioned fear response (CR) on its own. In differential fear conditioning, there are two initially neutral stimuli. One of them, the CS+, is paired with the aversive US, while the other one, the CS−, is not. In this case, only the CS+ elicits a CR after several pairings with the US. Based on timing aspects of the CS–US pairing we have to distinguish two forms of classical fear conditioning: In delay conditioning, the US follows the CS with no temporal gap (e.g, either the US directly follows the CS or the CS and the US coterminate meaning that there is a overlap in time), while in trace conditioning there is a temporal gap, called the trace interval, between CS offset and US onset. In the latter case, a “memory trace” is necessary to learn the association between the CS and the US (Pavlov,  ). 

This small difference in timing was found to be associated with differences in the neural structures underlying the acquisition of fear. The most prominent structure reported to be crucial for fear learning is the amygdala. Information about the CS and the US is transmitted from sensory cortices via the thalamus to the amygdala, which controls the expression of the fear reaction via projections to the brainstem (e.g., LeDoux,  ). Other areas found to be involved in fear acquisition in delay conditioning are the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insular cortex. Activation in the ACC has been linked to the anticipation of pain. For example, Büchel et al. ( ) assumed that the ACC, together with activation of the anterior insula, might integrate nociceptive input with memory and therefore allows for appropriate responses to subsequent stimuli, as has been shown in pain studies (e.g., Coghill et al.,  ). The insula has been reported to be involved in conveying a cortical representation of fear to the amygdala (Phelps et al.,  ). Knight et al. ( ) and Milad et al. ( ) proposed that the ACC is involved in the expression of the fear response. It has often been reported that the hippocampus is involved in fear conditioning. The current opinion is, that contextual information, which can be of spatial or temporal nature, is represented in the hippocampus (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky,  ). Hippocampal activation has been shown to be crucial for trace conditioning since the trace interval requires the formation of a temporal context. This has been found both in fear conditioning (Büchel et al.,  ; Knight et al.,  ) as well as in eyeblink conditioning (Cheng et al.,  ). Also, Clark et al. ( ) reported that trace eyeblink conditioning additionally depends on the hippocampus and the neocortex, whereas for delay eyeblink conditioning activations of the cerebellum and the brainstem are sufficient. Human delay fear conditioning has been reported to occur without explicit hippocampal activity, too (see e.g., LaBar et al.,  ; Phelps et al.,  ; Schiller et al.,  ). Taken together, we conclude that the main neural structures involved in delay fear conditioning are the amygdala, the insula, and the ACC (see review by Sehlmeyer et al.,  ). However, for both fear and eyeblink trace conditioning, declarative memory, which is associated with hippocampus activity, is formed additionally. 

To understand the mechanisms of fear and the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders, it is not sufficient to study the acquisition of fear only. Inappropriate fear can also result from a deficit in extinction of the fear (Baas et al.,  ). Extinction occurs if the CS is presented several times without the US. Importantly, there is convincing evidence that extinction does not lead to forgetting or unlearning, but rather to the formation of a new memory inhibiting the acquired fear memory (Bouton,  ,  ; Milad and Quirk,  ; Myers and Davis,  ; Quirk,  ). To date, the neural structures involved in the extinction of fear are less understood than those involved in fear acquisition. The amygdala has been shown to play an important role in both acquisition and extinction. In addition, it is assumed that, as extinction, i.e., new learning, takes place, the prefrontal cortex inhibits the expression of conditioned fear (Quirk et al.,  ). Rodent models of extinction suggest that during extinction, an inhibitory memory trace between ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala is established (Sotres-Bayon et al.,  ,  ), by means of which the expression of fear is inhibited. The vmPFC activates GABAergic intercalated cells in the amygdala which in turn inhibit the central nucleus of the amygdala (Quirk et al.,  ; Sotres-Bayon et al.,  ). Evidence for this model has been provided by lesion studies (Morgan and LeDoux,  ; Quirk et al.,  ; Morgan et al.,  ; Lebron et al.,  ). For example Morgan and LeDoux ( ) showed that rats with lesions of the medial PFC were resistant to extinction learning in a delay fear conditioning paradigm. Human studies on the extinction of fear memory acquired through classical delay conditioning have confirmed the role of the amygdala and the vmPFC (Phelps et al.,  ; Milad et al.,  ). The insula and the ACC have also been shown to be involved in extinction learning in humans (Gottfried and Dolan,  ; Phelps et al.,  ). Additionally, extinction learning was found to be highly context dependent. Kalisch et al. ( ) for example showed that a network containing the vmPFC and the hippocampus is activated during context dependent recall of extinction memory. 

The striatum seems to be involved in affective learning, too, more precisely in the processing of prediction errors which occur when the expected result does not match the actual result (e.g., Delgado et al.,  ). Besides clear evidence that the striatum is involved in appetitive conditioning (e.g., O'Doherty et al.,  ), there is also growing evidence for its involvement in the processing of prediction errors in aversive conditioning such as classical fear conditioning (Jensen et al.,  ; Delgado et al.,  ). Importantly, the absence of the US during extinction resembles a positive prediction error, meaning that a negative outcome, which is expected, does not occur. Thus, the striatum has to be considered as an important region in the extinction of conditioned fear. 

Imaging studies examining extinction so far focused on delay conditioning, and little is known about extinction following trace conditioning in humans. Since differences in involved brain regions have been found during acquisition of delay and trace fear conditioning (see discussion above) it is likely that different brain areas are involved during extinction, too. Many situations in real life, in which fear is acquired, are closer to the trace than the delay conditioning paradigm, since there is often a temporal gap between a CS and the predicted US. Given the relevance of fear extinction for the maintenance of anxiety disorders, it seems very important to detect possible differences in the neural networks involved in these different types of fear conditioning. 

Based on prior results in humans, we expected that extinction of delay and trace fear conditioning is associated with activations of the amygdala and the vmPFC as well as involvement of the insular and the anterior cingulate cortices and the striatum. In contrast, we assumed differences between delay and trace conditioning regarding activations in the prefrontal cortex. One model of the functional organization of the lateral PFC postulates that the ventrolateral part of the PFC is mainly involved in the maintenance of information, such as retaining a sequence of letters in working memory, whereas the dorsal part is more important when it comes to manipulation of information, such as reordering the sequence into alphabetical order (D'Esposito et al.,  ). There are also findings that nonhuman primates and humans with lesions of the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) are less able to adjust behavior appropriately in delayed response tasks (e.g., D'Esposito et al.,  ). In these tasks it is necessary to hold information in working memory over a short temporal gap before making choices and decisions. This demand is similar to forming and changing a memory trace bridging the trace interval in trace fear conditioning. Therefore, in contrast to vmPFC contributions to the extinction of delay memory, the dlPFC might—exclusively or additionally—be involved in the extinction of trace memory. Evidence for the involvement of the dlPFC in trace eyeblink conditioning also comes from animal models. Weiss and Disterhoft ( ) propose a neural network in which the dlPFC, together with prelimbic areas, orchestrates neural activity that bridges the trace interval. Finally, since the hippocampus is assumed to be involved in the formation of declarative memory in a conditioning process, we expected it to play a greater role in the extinction of trace memory compared to delay memory. 

The present study used virtual reality (VR) to implement both the delay and the trace fear conditioning paradigm. VR is a powerful tool for studying fear reactions in ecologically valid environments (Mühlberger et al.,  , ,  , ). It has successfully been applied in treatment of specific phobias (Mühlberger et al.,  ) as well as in conditioning studies (Baas et al.,  ,  ; Alvarez et al.,  ; Glotzbach et al.,  ; Tröger et al.,  ). The use of VR allows for the full control of a fear conditioning situation that is closer to the complexity of learning situations in real life than most laboratory designs. The used virtual environment consisted of a corridor and an office, through which subjects were passively guided while lying in the scanner. In both the delay (DCG) and the trace conditioning group (TCG), a blue and a yellow light in the office served as CS+ and CS−, respectively, and a mildly painful electric stimulus as US. Besides ratings of valence, arousal, fear, and contingency assessed after acquisition and extinction phases, the BOLD response differences between the CS+ and CS− served as indices of brain responses related to learning. Specifically, differences between delay and trace fear conditioning during extinction were analyzed. Bold responses during acquisition were not analyzed because of an overlap of brain responses to the CS and US in the learning phase due to their temporal closeness. 


## Methods and materials 
  
### Participants 
  
The final sample consisted of 26 participants, 13 in the DCG (5 male, 8 female, mean age = 23.1 years,   SD   = 3.0 years) and 13 in the TCG (4 male, 9 female, mean age = 23.5 years,   SD   = 2.5 years). All participants gave their written informed consent and received 12 €/h for participation. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Würzburg. 

To reach this sample, a total of 43 right-handed volunteers (14 male, 29 female; age 19–29) had to be recruited. They were randomly assigned to the DCG or the TCG. Excluding criteria were past or present psychiatric disorders, use of antipsychotic drugs, regular alcohol or drug consumption (one subject was excluded), and allochromasia (for blue and yellow) assessed by self-report. Twelve subjects had to be excluded due to technical problems, and one subject because of extensive head movements during scanning. Three participants did not explicitly learn the contingency between the CSs and the US (only DCG, see below). They were also excluded because the small group size did not allow for a separate analysis to investigate distinct neuronal patterns in aware vs. unaware participants. 


### Stimuli and apparatus 
  
#### VR environment 
  
For creating the virtual environment of the experiment we used the Source Engine SDK (Valve Corporation, Bellevue, Washington, USA). Some office models were used from the free Source Engine Modification “Weekday Warrior” ( ). The virtual environment consisted of an office and an associated corridor evenly illuminated in a neutral white light. In the office, a lamp situated in the middle of the room could be switched on and off. The color of the light illuminated by the lamp was either blue or yellow and served as CS+ or CS−, respectively (see Figure  ). If turned on, the lamp illuminated the whole room. One light (CS+) was followed by a mildly painful electric stimulus (US) with 100% contingency; the other light (CS−) was never followed by an US. Colors of CS+ and CS− were counterbalanced across participants and groups. In the delay conditioning paradigm, the lights were always switched on for 8 s, and the US was presented simultaneously with the offset of the CS+. In the trace paradigm, the lights were presented for 4 s, and the US was presented 8 s after CS+ onset; thus, the trace interval between CS and US lasted 4 s. To avoid movement in the scanner and enhance control over the course of events during the experiment, participants were guided through the VR environment on a prerecorded path. We used the in-house written VR simulation software CyberSession to manipulate the VR environment during the experiment (e.g., switching on the light, delivering the electrical pulse). VR rendering was done by an image generator running the in-house written Source SDK modification VRSessionMod 0.3. The virtual environment was displayed via MRI-compatible goggles (VisuaStim; Magnetic Resonance Technologies, Northridge, CA, USA). 
  
 Virtual office illuminated in two different lights (right in blue and left in yellow) which served as conditioned stimuli (CS) and with normal illumination (ISI, inter-stimulus interval)  . 
  

#### Electric stimuli 
  
The US was a mildly painful electric stimulus generated by a current stimulator (Digitimer DS7A, Digitimer Ltd, Hertfordshire, England). It was delivered at the left index finger through surface bar electrodes consisting of two durable gold-pasted stainless steel disk electrodes with 9mm diameter, 30mm spacing, and with an impedance of max. 5 Ω. Electric stimuli associated with the CS+ were triggered automatically by CyberSession during conditioning for 200 ms with a frequency of 50 Hz. Current intensity was determined individually for each participant in the beginning of the experiment (for a detailed description of the adjustment of individual current intensity see Andreatta et al.,  ). It was adjusted at the individual pain threshold and increased by 30% to prevent habituation to the US. Both conditioning groups did not differ in current intensity (delay group:   M   = 2.25 mA,   SD   = 0.99; trace group:   M   = 2.18,   SD   = 0.90),   t   = 0.19,   p   = 0.853, and pain ratings (delay group:   M   = 5.00,   SD   = 0.84; trace group:   M   = 5.04,   SD   = 1.57),   t   = −0.08,   p   = 0.934, of the US. 



### Psychometric measures 
  
#### Ratings 
  
At several times during the experiment, ratings of valence (from “very negative” to “very positive”), arousal (from “not arousing at all” to “very arousing”), fear (from “no fear” to “extreme fear”), and CS–US contingency (from “not likely at all” to “very likely”) were collected, each on scales from 0 to 100. 


#### Awareness 
  
Explicit knowledge of contingencies between CS and US was assessed on the basis of the question “During which light presentation did you receive electric shocks?” Participants who were able to state the correct color of light after the second acquisition run were labeled “aware,” the others were labeled “unaware.” While 26 participants met these criteria of awareness; three participants in the DCG failed and were labeled “unaware.” There were no unaware participants in the TCG. 



### Procedure 
  
After reading information about the scanning procedure, participants completed the questionnaires on personal information and excluding criteria. Then they received written instructions related to the experiment and gave their written informed consent. The electrode for electric stimulation was attached when participants were already positioned in the scanner room. After that, the individual pain threshold was determined and adjusted as explained earlier. This preparation phase was followed by a pre-acquisition block, in which participants were guided through the virtual office once to get used to the environment and the two different lights (each light was presented once). After that, participants were told that they would be able to predict the electric stimuli if they paid close attention to the experiment. 

The following acquisition phase consisted of two blocks. Each block included two passages through the office. During one passage, participants were guided through the office once and were exposed to four CS+ and four CS−. The CS+ was always followed by the US. One room visit lasted 172 s; accordingly one block lasted approximately 6 min. During the complete acquisition participants were exposed to 16 CS+ and 16 CS− and received 16 US. 

The extinction phase consisted of one block including two visits with the same duration and CS frequencies as the acquisition trials (i.e., 8 CS+ and 8 CS−). No US was applied during extinction. 

Classification of lights as CS+ and CS− as well as order of stimuli was pseudo-randomized across participants. In total, there were four different courses of events, two of them with the blue light and two with the yellow light serving as CS+. The length of the interstimulus interval (ISI) was also pseudo-randomized and varied between 11 and 13 s in steps of 250ms. 


### Ratings 
  
After each of the two acquisition blocks, awareness was measured by posing free recall questions as described above. Participants rated screenshots of the room with either the CS+ or the CS− light switched on regarding valence, arousal and fear after pre-acquisition, each acquisition block and extinction. Additionally, after both acquisition phases and extinction, contingency of CS+ and CS− with the US was measured. For all ratings, questions and screenshots were presented via the goggles. Participants were told to relate their answers to the way they felt during the last phase of the experiment. Answers were given orally via the speaker system of the scanner room and recorded by the investigator. 


### Magnetic resonance imaging 
  
A 1.5-T whole-body magnetic resonance tomograph (MagnetomAvanto, SiemensHealthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with standard 12-channel head coil and integrated head holder was used for acquisition of structural and functional brain images. Structural imaging consisted of 160 T1-weighted sagittal magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo imaging (MP-RAGE) 3D MRI sequence (MPRAGE, 1mm slice thickness, TR = 2250 ms, TE = 3.93 ms, flip angle: 8°, FOV: 256mm, matrix: 256 × 256, voxel size: 1 × 1 × 1mm ). The acquisition of structural images was situated at the end of the experiment. 

Functional imaging was conducted in four phases (pre-acquisition, first and second acquisition phase and extinction). During subjective ratings after each of the experimental phases, imaging was intermitted. A total of 161 volumes was registered using a T 2-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging sequence (EPI) with 25 axial slices [slice thickness 5-mm with 1-mm gap, interleaved (descending) order] covering the whole brain (TR: 2500 ms; TE: 40 ms; flip angle: 90°; FOV: 240 × 240 mm; matrix size: 64 × 64; voxel size: 3.1 × 3.1 × 3mm ) for functional imaging. Orientation of axial slices was parallel to the AC-PC line. The first 8 images of each phase were excluded from analysis to allow for T1 equilibration. 


### Image preprocessing and statistical analysis 
  
#### Imaging 
  
Analysis of fMRI data was performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London) integraded in MatLab 7.0 (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA). After slice time correction, functional images were realigned. T1-scans were coregistered to each participant's mean image of the realigned. The mean functional images were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) single-subject template (Evans et al.,  ). Normalization parameters obtained from the previous segmentation procedure of coregistered T1 images were applied and images were resampled (voxel size 2 × 2 × 2mm ). Subsequently, EPI images were spatially smoothed with an 8-mm full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel and filtered with a 128 ms high pass filter. 

The different experimental conditions were modeled using a boxcar reference vector convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (general linear model, Kiebel and Holmes,  ). The six movement parameters of the rigid body transformation, applied by the realignment procedure, were included to regard variance caused by residual movement. Low-frequency signal drift was filtered using a first-order autoregressive model. Parameter estimates were subsequently calculated for each voxel using weighted least squares to provide maximum likelihood estimates based on the non-sphericity assumption in order to get identical and independently distributed error terms. Since we were especially interested in the activation related to the extinction of fear reactions, the extinction phase served as main test phase and the BOLD signal was calculated at the onset of the colored lights. In a conditioning paradigm with a CS–US contingency of 100% during acquisition we expected rapid decrease of fear reactions. To account for this, the extinction phase was divided into two parts of equal duration and the first and second half were analyzed separately (early and late extinction). In a second step we compared activation during early extinction (first to fourth CS+) with activation during late extinction (fifth to eighth CS+). 

First level individual contrast images (CS+ > CS−) were used in a second-level analysis (one sample   t  -test). Conditioning groups (delay and trace) were analyzed separately for the contrast CS+ > CS−. We also analyzed the contrast early extinction (CS+ > CS−) > late extinction (CS+ > CS−). ROI analyses were carried out for the amygdala, the hippocampus, the insula, the ACC (Brodmann areas 24, 32, and 33) the striatum (caudate and putamen) and the ventromedial (medial orbital frontal gyrus) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (middle frontal gyrus) at an uncorrected threshold of   p   = 0.005 with a minimum cluster size of ten voxel. Additionally, we conducted an explorative whole brain analysis which also included the cerebellum (  p   = 0.001, uncorrected, minimum cluster size of five voxel). ROIs were based on masks of the WFU Pick Atlas (Maldjian et al.,  ) and Brodmann Areas (BA). 


#### Ratings 
  
For the ratings of valence, arousal, and fear, ANOVAs were conducted for pre-acquisition and extinction with the between factors stimulus (CS+, CS−) and group (delay, trace). Ratings during acquisition were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVAs with the between factors stimulus (CS+, CS−) and group (delay, trace) and the additional within factor phase (Acquisition 1, Acquisition 2). Contingency ratings were not collected after pre-acquisition and thus were only analyzed for acquisition and extinction. 

All rating data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows (Release 17.0). Alpha was set at.05 for all statistical tests, effect sizes are reported as η  scores. 




## Results 
  
### Ratings 
  
#### Pre-acquisition 
  
As expected, after the pre-acquisition phase, CS+ and CS− did not differ in valence, arousal, or fear in any group (all   p  s > 0.23). 


#### Acquisition 
  
  Valence ratings   . For valence ratings, we found a significant main effect of stimulus,   F   = 13.49,   p   = 0.001, η  = 0.360, as well as a marginally significant interaction of Phase × Stimulus,   F   = 3.92,   p   = 0.059, η  = 0.140. The CS+ was rated overall more negative than the CS− (CS+:   M   = 36.83,   SD   = 20.49; CS−:   M   = 65.38,   SD   = 27.88). Significant effects involving the factor group were not detected. 

  Arousal rating   . The analysis revealed a significant main effect of stimulus,   F   = 33.05,   p   < 0.001, η  = 0.579, and a significant three way interaction of Phase × Stimulus × Group,   F   = 4.30,   p   = 0.049, η  = 0.152. After the first acquisition phase, the CS+ elicited more arousal than the CS− in both the delay group,   t   = 2.578,   p   = 0.024 (CS+:   M   = 40.38,   SD   = 25.70; CS−:   M   = 14.62,   SD   = 19.84), and the trace group,   t   = 5.41,   p   < 0.001 (CS+:   M   = 51.15,   SD   = 28.88; CS−:   M   = 8.46,   SD   = 9.87). After the second phase, we found a similar pattern as after the first phase in the trace group,   t   = 4.38,   p   = 0.001 (CS+:   M   = 40.77,   SD   = 26.91; CS−:   M   = 6.92,   SD   = 9.47), while in the delay group the effect was more pronounced than after the first phase,   t   = 3.534,   p   = 0.004, (CS+:   M   = 43.46,   SD   = 27.03; CS−:   M   = 9.62,   SD   = 18.76). 

  Fear ratings   . For fear ratings, we again found a significant main effect of stimulus,   F   = 22.32,   p   < 0.000, η  = 0.482, indicating that the CS+ elicited overall more fear than the CS− in both groups (CS+:   M   = 36.25,   SD   = 30.40; CS−:   M   = 5.58,   SD   = 11.57). 

  Contingency ratings   . The CS+ was clearly perceived as more likely to be followed by an electric stimulus during acquisition, main effect of stimulus,   F   = 201.45,   p   < 0.001, η  = 0.894 (CS+:   M   = 88.65,   SD   = 18.72; CS−:   M   = 9.62,   SD   = 14.69). Additionally, we found a significant interaction of Phase × Stimulus,   F   = 5.66,   p   = 0.026, η  = 0.191. Already after the first phase, the CS+ was rated as more likely to be followed by the US than the CS−,   t   = 6.681,   p   < 0.001 (CS+:   M   = 81.73,   SD   = 29.29; CS−:   M   = 15.00,   SD   = 27.75), but after the second phase this difference between CS+ and CS− further increased,   t   = 26.239,   p   < 0.001 (CS+:   M   = 95.58,   SD   = 14.45; CS−:   M   = 4.23,   SD   = 11.38). The contingency between the CS+ and the US was rated higher after the second than after the first phase,   t   = −2.612,   p   = 0.015. 


#### Extinction 
  
  Valence ratings   . The CS+ and the CS− did no differ significantly in their valence after extinction,   F   = 3.48,   p   = 0.075, η  = 0.127, although a marginal difference was still present. 

  Arousal ratings   . The analysis revealed a significant main effect of stimulus,   F   = 20.30,   p   < 0.001, η  = 0.458, as well as a significant interaction of Stimulus × Group,   F   = 5.26,   p   = 0.050, η  = 0.151. In the delay group, arousal ratings of CS+ and the CS− did not differ significantly. However, in the trace group, the CS+ was still rated as more arousing than the CS−,   t   = 4.368,   p   = 0.001 (CS+:   M   = 21.76,   SD   = 6.03; CS−:   M   = 10.05,   SD   = 2.91). 

  Fear ratings   . The main effect of stimulus was still significant after the extinction phase,   F   = 11.61,   p   = 0.002, η  = 0.326. We also found a marginal interaction of Stimulus x Group,   F   = 3.76,   p   = 0.064, η  = 0.136, suggesting similar results as for arousal ratings: In the trace group, the CS+ was after extinction still associated with more fear than the CS−,   t   = 3.726,   p   = 0.003 (CS+:   M   = 25.77,   SD   = 21.39; CS−:   M   = 6.15,   SD   = 10.44), while there was no such difference in the delay group,   t   = 1.054,   p   = 0.313. 

  Contingency ratings   . As for fear ratings, the main effect of stimulus persisted during the extinction phase,   F   = 18.39,   p   < 0.001, η  = 0.434. After extinction, the CS+ was still more associated with the US than the CS− (CS+:   M   = 47.31,   SD   = 35.98; CS−:   M   = 12.31,   SD   = 20.06). 

In sum, arousal and fear ratings suggest that extinction proceeded more slowly in the trace group compared to the delay group. After extinction, the trace group rated the CS+ still as more arousing and more frightening than the CS−, whereas in the delay group these differences were no longer present after extinction. 



### Imaging data 
  
#### Early extinction 
  
  ROI analysis   . Regarding the contrast of CS+ minus CS−, both groups showed insular and striatal activation during early extinction. Interestingly, the two groups differed in their prefrontal activation (see Figure  ). In the DCG, we observed significant activation of the vmPFC (medial orbital frontal gyrus R), while in the TCG the dlPFC was significantly activated (middle frontal gyrus R). Additionally, the trace group showed activation of the dorsal part of the ACC (BA 33). 
  
 BOLD Signals (CS+ > CS−) during early extinction (ROI, α < 0.005, uncorrected)  . In both DCG and TCG, Insula and Putamen were activated during early extinction. In the DCG, we observed significant activation of the vmPFC (medial orbital frontal gyrus R), while in the TCG the dlPFC (middle frontal gyrus R) was significantly activated. 
  
  Whole brain analysis   . In addition to the areas defined as ROIs, we also found significant activation in several other regions. In the DCG, the cuneus (L), the left motor cortex (precentral gyrus L), and the middle occipital gyrus (R) were activated. In the TCG, we found activations in the somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus L), the calcarine (R), the rolandic operculum (R), and the ventral ACC (middle cingulate cortex L, BA 24). 

For exact coordinates see Table  .

#### Late extinction 
  
  ROI analysis   . For the second phase of extinction, we observed significant activation in the ventral part of the ACC in the DCG only. 

  Whole brain analysis   . In the DCG, the ventral ACC (R), the inferior frontal gyrus (R), and the supramarginal gyrus (R) were activated during late extinction. In the TCG however, we found significant activation of the precuneus (L and R). 

For exact coordinates see Table  .

The cluster with the largest number of significant voxels within each region is reported. Coordinates x, y, and z of the peak voxels are given in Montreal Neurological Institute space. 
  

#### Early extinction > late extinction 
  
  ROI analysis   . We also tested for areas, which showed stronger activation in the early extinction than in the late extinction. In the delay group, this was the case for the insula (L), whereas in the trace group the hippocampus (R) and the striatum (putamen L) showed greater activation in the first part of the extinction compared to the second part. 

  Whole brain analysis   . Whole brain analysis revealed additional activation of the ACC (ventral anterior cingulate area), the precentral gyrus (L), and the transverse temporal gyrus (Heschl L) in the DCG. In the TCG, the ventral ACC (L) was activated as in the delay group, and additionally we found activation in the parahippocampal area.

## Discussion 
  
To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating neural substrates of extinction of both delay and trace fear memory in humans. In both conditioning groups we found activation in the insular cortex and the striatum during early extinction. Interestingly, extinction of delay and trace memory differed in prefrontal activation. The vmPFC was activated during extinction in the DCG, while the dlPFC was activated during extinction in the TCG. These results point to different PFC activity involved in early extinction of delay vs. trace fear conditioning. In the late part of the extinction process, the delay group only showed significant activation of the ventral ACC. No other activation could be found in our predefined regions of interest during the second half of extinction. However, when comparing the early with the late part of extinction, we found greater activation in the insula (delay group), the hippocampus, and the striatum (trace group) during early extinction. 

### Prefrontal cortex 
  
The most prominent result of our study is the dissociation of prefrontal activation in delay vs. trace conditioning during early extinction. As has been shown in previous human fear conditioning studies, the vmPFC plays an important role in the extinction of fear memory (e.g., Phelps et al.,  ). In accordance with findings from the animal model it is assumed that, during extinction, an inhibitory memory trace is formed between the vmPFC and the amygdala (Sotres-Bayon et al.,  ,  ), which allows for the modulation of the fear response. However, existing evidence from human studies for this model comes exclusively from delay fear conditioning. Significant activation of the vmPFC in the DCG of our study provides further evidence for this model. Milad et al. ( ) indicated that the vmPFC is not only involved in extinction learning, but also in the retention of extinction memory. They reported a significant correlation between the thickness of the medial orbitofrontal cortex and skin conductance response (SCR) in extinction recall assessed one day after extinction training. More precisely, a thicker medial orbitofrontal cortex was associated with a lower SCR in extinction recall, that is, with greater extinction memory. 

However, in the TCG, we did not find significant activation of the vmPFC, but instead of the dlPFC. This finding points to different processes during extinction in delay and trace conditioning. VmPFC activation in delay conditioning reflects the inhibition of the fear response already during early extinction. According to a model of functional organization of the lateral PFC, the vmPFC is mainly involved in the mere maintenance of information, whereas the dorsal part is assumed to be involved in the manipulation of information, requiring more working memory capacities (D'Esposito et al.,  ; Postle et al.,  ). As mentioned in the introduction, lesion studies in nonhuman and human primates indicate that the dlPFC is important for adjusting behavior appropriately in delayed response tasks (e.g., D'Esposito et al.,  ), in which information has to be kept in working memory for a short period of time before making choices and decisions on the basis of this information. This interpretation is in line with activation of the dlPFC during the extinction of trace conditioning. In contrast to delay conditioning, trace conditioning and its extinction afford higher working memory contribution to bridge the trace interval and hold information in short term memory. Results of ratings indicate that extinction proceeded more slowly in the trace group compared to the delay group. In the DCG, we did no longer find differences in arousal and fear ratings of the CS+ compared to the CS− after extinction. However, the CS+ was still rated more arousing and more frightening than the CS− in the TCG. A slower extinction process in the trace group can be seen as an indication for a higher working memory contribution in the extinction of trace conditioning and therefore may account for different processes of extinction in delay and trace conditioning. There is also an interesting connection between our findings and evidence from trace eyeblink conditioning in rabbits (Weiss and Disterhoft,  ). They assume an important role of the dlPFC in the acquisition of trace conditioning: Activation of dlPFC and hippocampus potentiates the effect of the CS at pontine nuclei on the way to the cerebellum and thus bridge the trace interval during acquisition. After consolidation of the CS+/US association, structures mediating the conditioned response reorganize. While the hippocampus becomes less important, the dlPFC becomes more important. Further research with regard to both acquisition and extinction is necessary for investigating to what extend these findings from the animal model can be transferred to classical conditioning in humans. 


### Insula and ACC 
  
In both conditioning groups we found activation of the insular cortex during early extinction. Additionally, the insula showed greater activation in the early compared to the late extinction in the delay group. Evidence for the involvement of the insula in classical fear conditioning comes, among others, from Phelps et al. ( ): In contrast to the instructed fear paradigm, in which the insula was activated already in early trials, the activation in the conditioning paradigm occurred not until the later trials of acquisition, when participants were consciously aware of the association between the CS+ and the US. These findings are consistent with evidence coming from pain research showing that the insula plays an important role in the anticipation of pain (e.g., Ploghaus et al.,  ; Wiech et al.,  ). Phelps et al. ( ) suggest that the anticipation of pain leads to a cortical representation of fear, which is transmitted to the amygdala via the insular cortex. During early extinction of fear memory, the CS+ is no longer followed by a painful stimulus. However, it is still associated with the US and thus leads to the anticipation of pain, resulting in the observed activation of the insular cortex. Interestingly, during extinction of both trace and delay fear conditioning, insular activation was limited to the right hemisphere. The left insula has been associated with semantic processing which is necessary in instructed fear conditioning. In contrast, the right insula has been associated with the response to a sensory aversive US like for example the mildly painful electric stimulus we applied (for further information see for example Craig,  ). 

In addition to the insula, the dorsal ACC was activated during early extinction in the TCG. Moreover, we found stronger activation of the ACC during early extinction compared to late extinction in both groups. The combined activation of the ACC and the insula has been discussed to represent a pathway for the integration of nociceptive input in memory processes (Coghill et al.,  ). According to this model, both structures are involved in the adjustment of behavior in response to a stimulus predicting pain (see also Büchel et al.,  ). The ACC has also been associated with sustained attention toward a stimulus that might be followed by pain (Yaguez et al.,  ). There is broad evidence that sustained attention is necessary for trace fear conditioning, but not for delay conditioning. In a trace conditioning paradigm, fear memory is only established when subjects are consciously aware of the CS–US contingency. However, in delay paradigm, conditioning can also occur when participants have not formed declarative memory and thus are unaware of the association between the CS and the US (e.g., Manns et al.,  ; Clark et al.,  ; Weike et al.,  ). Han et al. ( ) have shown that attention-distracting stimuli interfere with trace but not delay or contextual fear conditioning in mice. Moreover, they found a higher density of c-fos-positive cells in the ACC of mice that had undergone trace fear conditioning compared to delay conditioning. In the same study, lesions of the ACC selectively impaired trace conditioning. These results give additional evidence for the association of ACC activation and sustained attention during trace fear conditioning, and also offer an explanation why we found combined activation of the insula and the ACC only during the early extinction of trace but not delay fear memory. 


### Striatum 
  
During acquisition of fear memory, the expectation is formed that an initially neutral stimulus is followed by a negative event such as an electric stimulus. During extinction, this expectation is violated: The negative event does no longer occur. This discrepancy between the expected and the actual outcome is referred to as prediction error (e.g., Schultz et al.,  ). The striatum has been shown to be involved in the coding of prediction errors in both appetitive and also aversive classical and instrumental conditioning. This applies to primary reinforcers such as pain (Phelps et al.,  ; Seymour et al.,  ), but also to secondary ones such as monetary gains (e.g., Delgado,  ). In our study, we found striatal activation in both the DCG and the TCG. These results provide further evidence for the important role of the striatum not only in the acquistion (Jensen et al.,  ; Delgado et al.,  ; Klucken et al.,  ; Tabbert et al.,  ), but also in the extinction of fear memory and therefore in the coding of prediction errors characterized by the omission of a negative outcome. Raczka et al. ( ) recently showed that a functional polymorphism of the dopamine transporter gene, which is mainly expressed in the striatum, influences extinction learning. The 9-repeat allele is associated with enhanced phasic dopamine release and with higher learning rates in the extinction of conditioned fear. In 9R carriers they also found stronger activation of the ventral striatum in response to prediction errors during extinction. In relation to these findings they assumed that extinction is an appetitive-like learning process mediated by the mesostriatal dopamine system, rather than a learning process driven by an aversive prediction error. 


### Hippocampus 
  
The hippocampus has been found to be involved in the representation of the temporal context in a conditioning process, which plays an important role in a trace paradigm including a temporal gap between CS+ and US (e.g., Phillips and LeDoux,  ). In the TCG, we found greater hippocampal activation in the comparison of early vs. late extinction. Clark et al. ( ) stated that the hippocampus is crucial for explicit or declarative memory processes. According to them, trace conditioning requires declarative knowledge and therefore hippocampus activity because the temporal gap between the CS and the US makes it difficult to process the CS–US relationship in an automatic, reflexive way. Knight et al. ( ) found hippocampal activation during extinction as well. They also reported a rapid decrease of its activation during the early trials of extinction. 


### Amydala 
  
We did not find significant activation of the amygdala in either one of the two groups. One possible reason for this is the rapid habituation of amygdala activity during extinction learning, especially in a conditioning paradigm with 100% contingency of CS+ and US during acquisition (e.g., LaBar et al.,  ). Secondly, EPI is highly vulnerable to susceptibility artifacts, which occur near the interfaces of substance of different magnetic susceptibility and thus are likely in structures of the medial temporal lobe, like the amygdala (Bellgowan et al.,  ; Stocker et al.,  ). 


### Conclusion 
  
In sum, our results add further evidence for the involvement of the PFC, insula, ACC, striatum, and hippocampus in the extinction of conditioned fear memory. We could also confirm that the ACC and the hippocampus are mainly involved in trace conditioning processes. The ACC has been associated with sustained attention, which is necessary for trace but not delay conditioning. The hippocampus is assumed to be necessary for the processing of the temporal context necessary to bridge the trace interval. Most important, our results indicate that different parts of the PFC are activated during extinction of delay vs. trace fear conditioning, the vmPFC vs. the dlPFC, respectively. These results point to different underlying processes during extinction of these two types of conditioning. Due to limited power of our study and a relatively liberal level of significance, results have to be interpreted with care. More evidence is needed to elucidate the role of the PFC in the extinction of trace conditioning in more detail and to translate results from the animal model to human trace fear conditioning

# Title

A Tool for Classifying Individuals with Chronic Back Pain: Using Multivariate Pattern Analysis with Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent health problems in the world today, yet neurological markers, critical to diagnosis of chronic pain, are still largely unknown. The ability to objectively identify individuals with chronic pain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is important for the advancement of diagnosis, treatment, and theoretical knowledge of brain processes associated with chronic pain. The purpose of our research is to investigate specific neurological markers that could be used to diagnose individuals experiencing chronic pain by using multivariate pattern analysis with fMRI data. We hypothesize that individuals with chronic pain have different patterns of brain activity in response to induced pain. This pattern can be used to classify the presence or absence of chronic pain. The fMRI experiment consisted of alternating 14 seconds of painful electric stimulation (applied to the lower back) with 14 seconds of rest. We analyzed contrast fMRI images in stimulation versus rest in pain-related brain regions to distinguish between the groups of participants: 1) chronic pain and 2) normal controls. We employed supervised machine learning techniques, specifically sparse logistic regression, to train a classifier based on these contrast images using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. We correctly classified 92.3% of the chronic pain group (N = 13) and 92.3% of the normal control group (N = 13) by recognizing multivariate patterns of activity in the somatosensory and inferior parietal cortex. This technique demonstrates that differences in the pattern of brain activity to induced pain can be used as a neurological marker to distinguish between individuals with and without chronic pain. Medical, legal and business professionals have recognized the importance of this research topic and of developing objective measures of chronic pain. This method of data analysis was very successful in correctly classifying each of the two groups.

## Introduction 
  
Chronic pain, defined as pain that persists for an extended time after the injury has completed the healing phase  – , is one of the most prevalent health problems in developed countries  – . It is estimated that chronic pain affects more than 100 million Americans  ,  – . The increased medical expenses, lost income and lowered productivity make chronic pain one of the most costly health problems in the world. 

Despite the importance, interest, and expense associated with chronic pain, there is still no widely accepted objective measure of chronic pain. Diagnosis of chronic pain is based primarily on the subjective reports of the individual  ,  , or subjective reports by care providers. However, cognitive, communicative, and psychological impairments, as well as deception  – , preclude the reliable use of self-reports in certain situations. While objective measures of pain may not replace subjective pain ratings as argued by Robinson et al.,   and Sullivan et al.,  , it is likely that brain based objective measures of pain may augment and facilitate diagnosis, treatment, and promote better understanding of the underlying cause of different types of pain  ,  – . For example, while a doctor may identify the presence of a fever by asking the patient if they feel hot or cold, an objective measure of temperature taken by a thermometer greatly improves the diagnosis. 

Recently, several studies have focused on assessing the presence and sensitivity of acute pain by applying multivariate pattern analysis to brain imaging data  ,  ,  –  (See   for a comprehensive review of applying machine learning algorithms to pain neuroimaging). Many of these studies were successful at classifying the presence or absence of pain in normal healthy individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activity data. Depending on the nature of the decoding task and training/testing method, classification performance was as follows: Thermal pain tolerance versus temperature sensation: 91% using Gaussian process classification  ; 86% using relevance vector machines  ; 91% and 86% respectively using support vector machines  ,  ; 95% using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularized principal components regression  . Thermal pain detection versus thermal pain tolerance: 71% using Gaussian process classification;  ; 69% using relevance vector machines  , 68% using support vector machines  . Thermal pain detection versus temperature sensation: 71% using Gaussian process classification  ; 68% using relevance vector machines  ; 91% using support vector machines  ; 61% using laser stimulated near-threshold painful from non-painful trials  . The study by Wager et al.,   in particular defines a ‘neural pain signature’ that may be a universal signature for pain composed of weighted activity from many brain regions that may be generalized across subjects and is sensitive to different types of pain. It is unclear, however, whether the ‘neural pain signature’ derived from acute pain will generalize to chronic pain  . 

There is evidence supporting the position that individuals with chronic pain may have a functional reorganization in brain regions associated with pain compared to individuals without chronic pain  ,  – . This functional reorganization may be the cause of their symptoms in the absence of any physical injury to the body. This reorganization may manifest itself in the form of differences in intrinsic brain connectivity reflected in resting state networks that have been shown to differ in individuals with chronic pain  . Cortical reorganization in individuals with chronic pain has also been shown to manifest itself in regional differences in grey matter density  ,  – . In particular the study by Ung et al.   utilizes multivariate pattern analysis to successfully classify the presence or absence of chronic pain using morphological differences in the anatomical magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of 47 patients and 47 normal controls with an accuracy level of 76%. 

We hypothesize, based on long-term reorganization in brain processes associated with chronic pain, that individuals suffering from chronic pain do have different patterns of brain activity that can be recorded by fMRI. In this experiment we record alternating periods of painful stimulation each followed by a period of no stimulation using fMRI brain scanning. Since there is known variability in subjective pain sensation in different individuals   we chose to investigate brain activity in response to each individual’s subjective maximum tolerable level in this experiment. Multivariate pattern analysis, in this case, sparse logistic regression (SLR)  , is predicted to be able to recognize differences of brain activity between individuals with chronic pain and normal controls in response to induced pain. A leave-one-out cross-validation procedure is used to train and test the SLR classifiers based on differential activity in contrast images of induced pain relative to rest in specific brain regions thought to be involved with pain processing (Including: primary somatosensory cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, inferior parietal cortex, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex  ). A classifier is defined as a set of variables (in our case, weights of the extracted features of the SLR) that sorts the data samples into different categories. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure the total number of classifiers is equal to the number of participants to be classified. Each classifier is trained on data for all participants except the one upon which it is tested. 

Our study extends the use of fMRI data and multivariate pattern analysis techniques to classify individuals with and without chronic pain. Many applications of multivariate techniques to fMRI data have been designed to classify types of stimulus, conditions or trials within a single individual using the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity from several scans as input from the same individual  ,  ,  . Our goal differs from these studies in that it seeks to demonstrate generalized diagnostic performance for identifying presence or absence of chronic pain for individuals not used during training of the classifier. 


## Methods 
  
### Ethics Statement 
  
All participants were informed of the experimental procedures to be used. All procedures were approved by the New England Institutional Review Board (NEIRB) in accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave written informed consent prior to the experiment. Participants were paid for taking part in the experiment. 


### Subjects 
  
Twenty-six screened individuals participated in this study. Thirteen of the participants had chronic pain (chronic pain group) and thirteen of the participants had no chronic pain (normal, control group). The two groups of participants were matched for gender (nine female and four male), handedness (ten right, two left, one ambidextrous), and race (ten Caucasian, three Black African American). None of the participants had a history of psychiatric illness, organic brain disease, unstable medical illness, or history of serious head injury. The mean age for the chronic pain group was 51.8 years (SE 1.89, range 43 to 65) and the normal group was 48.7 years (SE 2.37, range 38 to 62 years). There was no significant difference in age between the two groups (T = 0.95, p = 0.36). 

All chronic pain subjects suffered from muscle-skeletal low back pain. The diagnosis of muscle-skeletal low back chronic pain by the participant’s physician was based on several different criteria including: the duration of the participant’s complaint (minimum of six months), radiological or MRI type exams, tests performed for allodynia and hyperalgesia, confirmation of muscle atrophy, physical weakness, numbness or altered feeling, sleep disorders, memory dysfunction, and range of motion limitation. Additionally, physicians may have augmented their analysis with subjective participant-reported testing information such as the Pain Catastrophising Scale  ; Waddell Signs  , Visual Analog Scale  , and the Fear Avoidance Belief’s Questionnaire   for example. None of the subjects in the normal control group reported suffering from chronic pain. 


### Equipment 
  
The equipment used in this experiment consisted of the following: 
  
Seimens 1.5 Tesla Entera MRI scanner. 
  
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved constant current stimulation device and pulse generation device. 
  
Stimulating Electrodes. 
  
Coaxial Shielded Lead. 
  
Item one was used to gather and record data, and items two through four were used to time and deliver stimulation. The stimulation equipment used is compatible for use in the MRI scanner. 


### Procedure 
  
Participants filled out a questionnaire, were interviewed, and then questioned prior to being included in the study. To prepare for the experiment, the chronic pain participants were required not to take any medication for 12 hours prior to scanning. On the day of the experiment, the level of stimulation that each participant could withstand was determined by applying two self-adhesive electrodes to the participant’s lower lumbar area, one on each side of the spine. The electrodes were then connected to the leads of the constant current generator and pulse timing apparatus. A current of 0.4 mA was initially applied to the participant and increased in 0.1 mA increments until the participant indicated that this was the highest pain level that they could withstand for the duration of the study. This level, for each participant, was the level used during the fMRI experiment for that participant. The stimulation level for the chronic pain group (mean = 0.819 mA, SE = 0.116) and the normal group (mean = 0.662 mA, SE = 0.063) was not significantly different (T = 1.22, p = 0.25). The participants were instructed to remain still throughout the fMRI scanning procedure. Subjects were instructed to inform the experimenter if the pain level was too high and that the experiment could be discontinued at any time. 


### Experiment 
  
The experiment consisted of two conditions: electrical stimulation alternated with no stimulation (rest). Electrical stimulation while the participant lay in the scanner was conducted using the same equipment and level as had been previously determined for each individual. The electrical stimulation was delivered first for 14 seconds then followed by 14 seconds of no stimulation (rest). This sequence was repeated 5 times. The experiment consisted of two fMRI data gathering sessions (approximately 5.25 minutes each) separated by one session in which a T1 high-resolution (0.5×0.5×1 mm) anatomical brain scan was acquired (approximately 4.5 minutes) for each participant. The mean normalized anatomical T1 MRI scans (axial slices from Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) z −50 to +85 in 3 mm steps) for the chronic pain group and the normal control group, are displayed in  . Total time for each participant in the MRI room was less than 15 minutes. The order in which subjects underwent scanning was random. 


### fMRI Data Collection and Preprocessing 
  
The experiment was conducted using a Seimens 1.5 Tesla Entera scanner. Functional T2* weighted images were acquired using a gradient echo-planar imaging sequence (repetition time 3670 ms, time to echo = 60 ms, flip angle = 90 degrees). A total of 36 interleaved axial slices were acquired with a 3×3×3 mm voxel resolution covering the cortex. A single run consisted of 86 scans (approximately 5.25 minutes). Images were preprocessed using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping version 8: Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University College London). Echo planar images (EPI) were unwarped and realigned. The images were then spatially normalized to MNI space (2×2×2 mm voxels) using a template T1 image and the mean EPI image as the source. The images were smoothed using an 8×8×8 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. 

Regional brain activity was assessed using a general linear model employing a boxcar function convolved with a hemodynamic response function (block design experiment). High pass filtering (cutoff period 128 seconds) was carried out to reduce the effects of extraneous variables (scanner drift, low frequency noise, etc). Auto-regression was used to correct for serial correlations. For each participant the contrast image of the electrical stimulation condition relative to the no stimulation condition was determined. We hypothesized that this contrasted image would differ for the participant with chronic pain compared to those without chronic pain. 


### Feature Selection for the SLR Decoder 
  
One major challenge for analyzing fMRI data, is the problem of over-fitting the data (an inability to generalize classification to novel test data), since there are far more features than subjects. We utilize two methods to reduce the number of features to overcome problems associated with over-fitting. 

The first method was to utilize a multivariate pattern analysis technique, sparse logistic regression (SLR)  . SLR automatically selects only a few relevant features to be used for training and classification. This method has been shown to be quite effective for fMRI data where there are many more features than there are samples for training  . SLR is a Bayesian extension of logistic regression in which feature selection and training of the model parameters is performed simultaneously, selecting a few highly relevant features to be used for classification. This avoids problems related to over-fitting and enhances classification performance on novel data  . SLR utilizes supervised learning to train a classifier (SLR decoder) based on a known set of input stimuli. For a review of multivariate techniques applied to fMRI data see  ,  – . 

The second method is to reduce the initial number of features by focusing only on brain regions known to be involved in pain processing, specifically chronic pain processing. We carried out our analyses only on brain regions found to be active during induced pain by Giesecke et al.,  . The brain regions active during induced pain in both chronic pain subjects and normal control subjects (without chronic pain) were: 
  
primary somatosensory cortex, 
  
secondary somatosensory cortex, 
  
inferior parietal cortex, 
  
insula, and 
  
anterior cingulate cortex. 
  
While the cerebellum was included in the Giesecke et al.,   study, it was not used in this study, since it wasn’t consistently included in the field of view in the fMRI scanning for all the subjects. 

A mask was created using a standard MRI based anatomical atlas (WFU PickAtlas SPM toolbox). The mask (6686 voxels) of these regions of the brain (relative to 153595 voxels over the entire brain) was used for training and testing the SLR decoder. 


### Training and Testing the SLR Decoder 
  
Classification of each individual’s data was based on a statistical contrast image from each subject (the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) result of the electrical stimulation relative to no stimulation contrast image SPM con_0001.img) consisting of the masked voxels as described above. A leave-one-out cross validation technique was used to train and test the classification performance of the SLR. Using this cross-validation technique, 25 participants were used to train a SLR decoder which was then tested on the one sample that was left out. Independent SLR classifiers are trained using this procedure until all 26 samples have been tested in an unbiased manner. Performance was assessed by calculating the percent-correct for each of the two groups. 


### Statistical Analyses 
  
Non-parametric methods were used to assess the significance of the performance of the SLR decoder using permutation testing of 1000 randomly shuffled labels  ,  . This was accomplished by determining the number of times the performance of the decoder trained with accurate labeling was greater than the distribution of decoders trained with random labeling (assessed using p<0.05). Mean posterior accuracy and the posterior probability interval (serving as a confidence interval at p<0.05) were calculated based on procedures reported in  . Statistical significance of the selected features (using the false discovery rate (FDR) correcting for multiple comparisons pFDR <0.05,  ) was determined in the following manner: The number of cross-validation iterations, out of 26, a feature (voxel) is selected by the SLR decoder using the real labels is compared to the distribution of the number of cross-validation iterations a feature is selected using 1000 permutations of randomly shuffled labels. Essentially, a comparison is made between the number of times a specific voxel is selected using the correct labeling relative to chance (random labeling). 

Standard random-effects analyses was used to assess differences in brain activity between the two groups (using SPM8). A between subjects t-test was used to determine differences between chronic pain and normal control subjects over the masked voxels used to train the SLR decoders (using the stimulation relative to rest contrast images). Random-effects between subject t-tests, weighting the brain activity by pain threshold level, were conducted to determine whether differences in general properties of stimulation are responsible for the SLR decoding performance obtained in our study. An additional random-effects analysis was carried out for the chronic pain group to assess the correlation between brain activity and the duration since the onset of the chronic condition. 

For the demographic variables of age and pain threshold level, Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit tests were conducted to determine if the data was normally distributed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test differences in the medians of the chronic pain group and the normal group for the variables of interest when the data was found not to be normally distributed. 

The same preprocessing and statistical parametric analysis methods were carried out for all subjects in both the chronic pain group and the normal control group. The chronic pain versus normal group labeling that each subject belonged to was unknown to the person conducting these analyses. Given that the procedure is completely automated the programs do not have information regarding the group that a particular subject belongs to. This is not the case when training the multivariate pattern analysis classifiers. The utilization of supervised machine learning techniques, in this case sparse logistic regression, to train a classifier to distinguish between two groups requires that the labels be known. During testing, the classifier computes the predicted label of the individual based on the feature weights learned during training. It is important to emphasize that the classifier is completely blind to the true labels of the samples during testing. 



## Results 
  
The results of the SLR classification for the chronic pain and normal group are given in  . The percent correct was determined by mean performance of the 26 classifiers trained using the leave-one-out cross-validation method explained previously. Significance at p<0.05 was determined using permutation tests of SLR classification over the randomly shuffled labels (1000 random samples) of the subjects in the training set. The overall classification accuracy for both groups together was 92.3% (p<0.05) with a D Prime of 2.924. The percent correct classification for the chronic pain group (sensitivity) was 92.3% (p<0.05) and for the normal group (specificity) was also 92.3% (p<0.05). Posterior mean accuracy and posterior probability intervals were computed using methods reported in   and given in  . 
   Performance of the Sparse Logistic Regression Classifier Chronic Pain versus Normal Group.        
The initial number of selected features before training was 6686. This was reduced by using the automatic relevance determination (ARD) characteristic of SLR  ,  ,   to a mean number of 2.85 extracted features across the 26 independently trained SLR classifiers (22 of the classifiers selected 3 features and 4 of the classifiers selected 2 features). It should be noted that the features are the individual voxels selected by the SLR classifier and the weights are the values assigned to each feature used for sorting the data into the different categories. Only five unique features (voxels) were used across the 26 independently trained SLR classifiers. The brain region of these selected voxels and their MNI coordinates are given in  . 
   MNI Coordinates for Sparse Logistic Regression Selected Voxels Weights Classifying Chronic Pain and Normal Individuals.        
The five features (voxels) selected defined three clusters of brain activity: Two of the clusters were located in the left primary somatosensory cortex S1, and one of the clusters was located in the left inferior parietal cortex ( ,  ). The features located in the primary somatosensory cortex S1 had negative weights (  blue clusters) signifying that the chronic pain group had lower activity relative to the normal group. The features located in the inferior parietal cortex had positive weights (  red cluster) signifying that the chronic pain group had greater activity relative to the normal group.

Inferior parietal cortex (MNI −57,−49,25) rendered on surface of MRI images sagittal, coronal, axial slices with MNI coordinates with an 8 mm sphere from center coordinate. 
  
All three clusters had features that were significant correcting for multiple comparisons ( ). The only feature (voxel) that was not significant, only being selected for one SLR classifier, was adjacent to the feature (voxel) that was selected for the other 25 SLR classifiers. 

Twenty-three of the correctly identified subjects had negatively weighted features from the primary somatosensory cortex S1 and positively weighted features from the inferior parietal cortex (IPC). The two subjects that were incorrectly classified (one chronic pain subject and one normal subject) involved features located in the primary somatosensory cortex S1. 

A standard random-effects (SPM8) between-groups two-sample t-test was carried out using the same contrast images that were used during training and testing of the SLR decoder. There were no significant differences (positive or negative) between the chronic pain group (N = 13) and the normal control group (N = 13) using a corrected false discovery rate threshold of pFDR = 0.05. One cluster of activity in the inferior parietal cortex was found for the chronic pain over the normal control group within the pain related regions of interest using a lenient threshold of p<0.005 (MNI −60,−46,28; T = 2.88). For the normal control group over the chronic pain group four clusters of activity were found bilaterally in different parts of the postcentral gyrus in the somatosensory cortex with a lenient threshold of p<0.005 (MNI  = −48,−22,58, T = 4.79; −21,−46,64, T = 4.19; 60,−19,49, T = 3.44; 39,−28,55, T = 3.00). 

To determine whether differences in general properties of stimulation were responsible for the SLR decoding performance obtained in the study, random-effects between-subject t-tests were conducted in which the brain activity (of the contrast images of stimulation relative to rest) was weighted by each individual’s pain threshold level. No significant difference in brain activity (positive or negative), between the chronic pain group (N = 13) and the normal control group (N = 13), was indicated using a corrected false discovery rate threshold of pFDR = 0.05 over the same voxels used to train the SLR decoder. The voxels selected by the SLR decoder (see  ) did not show any significant differential activity (p>0.05 uncorrected). Nor did a small-volume correction region of interest analysis (with an 8 mm search radius) detect any significant differential activity (p>0.05 corrected) around the voxels selected by the SLR decoder (see  ). 

To assess the correlation between brain activity and the duration since the onset of the chronic condition, a random-effects analysis was conducted for the chronic pain participants in which the contrast images of stimulation relative to rest were weighted by the duration since the onset of the suffering of chronic pain. No significant correlation between brain activity (positive or negative) and duration since the onset of the suffering of chronic pain was indicated using a corrected false discovery rate threshold of pFDR = 0.05 over the same voxels used to train the SLR decoder. The voxels selected by the SLR decoder (see  ) did not show any significant differential activity (p>0.05 uncorrected), nor did a small-volume correction region of interest analysis (with an 8 mm search radius) detect any significant differential activity (p>0.05 corrected) around the voxels selected by the SLR decoder (see  ). 

The demographics of the chronic pain and normal control subjects are given in  . As indicated, handedness, gender, and ethnicity are balanced across the two groups. Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit tests, over the variables of age and pain threshold level for each of the groups, indicated that the data was not normally distributed. The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess statistical differences (p<0.05 two-tailed) between the chronic pain group and the normal group for age (Median Chronic Pain Group = 52 years; Median Normal Group = 46 years; p>0.1 not significant) and pain threshold level (Median Chronic Pain Group = 0.75 mA; Median Normal Group = 0.6 mA; p>0.1 not significant) (See  ). There was no correlation between age and stimulation level for either group (Pearson Correlation p>0.1). Neither was there a correlation between the duration of the chronic pain and pain threshold level or age (Pearson Correlation p>0.1). 
   Plot of age (years) by pain threshold stimulation level (Milliamps) for each of the chronic pain (red) and normal control (blue) subjects.       Demographics for Subjects.        
A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess the statistical difference (p<0.05 two-tailed) in pain threshold between male (n = 8) and female (n = 18) participants (Median Male Group = 0.9 mA; Median Female Group = 0.6 mA; p>0.1 not significant). Even though our results show a tendency in the direction of higher thresholds for males it was not statistically significant. Although the results of several studies have shown that males have higher thresholds to experimentally induced pain than females (see   for review) there have been several studies that do not find statistical differences between males and females  ,  . 

Even though the chronic pain subjects had considerable variability in the duration from the onset of the chronic pain condition, the type of medication taken, and the duration the medication was taken, the SLR decoder was able to classify between the chronic and normal individuals with relatively high (92.3%) success. The two individuals that were misclassified by the decoder (one chronic pain and one normal control) do not appear to be outliers with regards to the demographic variables (see   and  ). 

To ensure the SLR classification results are not due to artifacts caused by differential head movement between chronic pain and normal subjects, between group analyses were conducted using the SPM realignment parameters. The summed scan-to-scan difference in the realignment parameters (tested separately for the six realignment parameters: Translation X, Y, Z dimensions, and rotation pitch, roll, yaw dimensions) did not show any statistically significant differences between the chronic pain and normal groups (See  ). Analysis of the total deviation within a session of the six realignment parameters also revealed no statistically significant difference between the chronic pain and the normal group (See  ). 

A post-hoc calculation of power was conducted (using procedures given in  ) to determine the sensitivity of the results with the sample size used in our study. Given the incidence of a positive classification in the chronic pain group of 0.923 with a standard deviation of 0.277, and the incidence of a positive classification in the normal group of 0.077 with a standard deviation of 0.277 using a two-sided 95% confidence interval, the power is 100% confirming the sensitivity of the results given the sample size for each group. Power values of 80% are considered to be standard in sample size calculations  . The posterior probability interval   (given in  ) similar to a confidence interval indicates the reliability at estimating the unknown population parameter given a two-tailed 95% confidence level. The posterior probability interval in our study using 13 subjects per group ranges from 75.7% to 97.7%, which is well above the chance level of 50%. Increasing the number of subjects will decrease the posterior probability interval and increase the reliability of the classification results. 


## Discussion 
  
The results of the experiment show that multivariate pattern analysis (specifically SLR) of the fMRI contrast image of induced pain relative to rest can be used to classify individuals with chronic pain with a mean accuracy of 92.3% ( ). This classification performance reflects that of novel test samples of a single contrast image (not included in the training), using a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. This degree of classification accuracy is quite impressive when one considers that no statistically significant differential activity correcting for multiple comparisons is present between the chronic pain group and the normal control group using traditional univariate random-effects analysis over the same data. Similarly, it is interesting to point out that the study by  ,   did not find consistent differences between chronic pain and normal groups for acute pain stimulation using univariate analyses. The high predictive performance of the multivariate decoder and the lack of strong univariate differential activity, strongly suggests that (multivoxel) patterns of activity are neurological markers that can be utilized for identifying individuals with chronic pain. 

The SLR decoder selected features in the left inferior parietal cortex and features from two different regions along the postcentral gyrus in the primary somatosensory cortex ( ,  ). These regions are part of the so called ‘pain matrix’  ,  ,  ,  . This region of the inferior parietal cortex (MNI coordinates −57, −49, 25) has been associated with heat stimulation   and cold pain  . One region of the somatosensory cortex (MNI coordinates −18,−43,61) is consistent with somatotopic representation of the trunk region  ,  , whereas, the other (MNI coordinates −42, −25, 58) is consistent with somatotopic representation of the hand  ,  . It is interesting to point out that individual decoders trained on voxels from the primary somatosensory cortex were able to significantly classify near-threshold pain versus no-pain in the study conducted by   but were not able to significantly classify between painful and nonpainful stimuli in normal individuals in the Brown et al.,   study. 

The use of several different brain regions by the SLR decoder is consistent with the view of pain being a distributed process  ,  ,  . While studies using a multivariate pattern analysis have shown that classification of pain versus no pain significantly utilizes activity in the insula  ,   and anterior cingulate   these regions did not contribute to classifying individuals with chronic pain from normal individuals based on our results. These results suggest that while these regions are important for distinguishing painful from non-painful stimuli the processes in these regions may not differ between individuals with chronic pain and normal individuals. Another possibility may be that the activity in these regions is similar to activity in the somatosensory and inferior parietal regions selected by the SLR decoder. One characteristic of SLR is that it will eliminate features that are similar in order to improve generalization performance. This is perhaps one reason why features are not bilaterally represented along the somatosensory strip as one would expect given that electrical stimulation included both left and right sides of the back. With a larger training sample size it is likely that more features will be selected while maintaining high generalization performance. 

The goal of this study was not to classify between pain and non-painful stimuli as has been done in many other studies  ,  ,  – , but rather to classify individuals with chronic pain from normal individuals by the patterns of the contrast in activity recorded between painful stimulation relative to rest. It has been conjectured that individuals with chronic pain may have a reorganization of processes within brain regions that is responsible for their ongoing sensation of pain  ,  – . In the study conducted by Ung et al.,  , multivariate pattern analysis over anatomical MRI of gray matter density was used to successfully classify individuals with chronic pain from normal controls with a accuracy of 76%. The weights of the support vector machine responsible for distinguishing the two groups were consistent with grey matter density decreases in chronic pain individuals in the right borderline amygdala, left medial orbital gyrus, and right cuneus; as well as grey matter density increases in the right cerebellum, regions of the temporal lobe, left primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, left primary motor cortex, the right calcarine sulcus, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Given the increased grey matter density in somatosensory cortex in the Ung et al.   study one may expect that in our study, individuals with chronic pain would show greater activity in these pain related brain regions under equal ‘subjective’ pain conditions than normal healthy individuals. (However, see  ,  ,   in which grey matter atrophy was found in individuals with chronic pain in many brain regions including the somatosensory cortex). While greater activity was found in the chronic pain group in the inferior parietal cortex (signified by positive weights meaning chronic pain > healthy normal group), it was not the case for activity in the primary somatosensory cortex (signified by negative weights meaning chronic pain < healthy normal group). Our results are more in line with studies  ,  ,   showing grey matter atrophy in somatosensory cortex as a possible reason for less activity being shown in response to electrical stimulation. While one may predict greater neural reorganization with the duration of chronic pain (denoted by changes in brain activity), this was not indicated by the random-effects analysis of the correlation between duration since onset of the suffering of chronic pain with that of brain activity (see Results). It may be the case that reorganization of neural processing mostly occurs within the first six months from the onset of suffering and does not show a linear relationship with time. In any case, the reorganization in brain activity that takes place was differentiated from that of normal controls by the SLR decoder even with only six months since the onset of suffering chronic pain for some individuals. 

There are several potential reasons why the SLR classifier weighted activity in the somatosensory cortex in the direction of normal individuals. Besides possible grey matter atrophy  ,  ,  , another possibility may be that individuals with chronic pain have a reorganization in inhibitory networks used to suppress pain that causes a reduction in somatosensory cortex activity under intense pain. There is some evidence suggesting potential motor inhibition during painful stimulation in chronic pain individuals  . It has been shown in rats that induced motor cortex stimulation can alleviate chronic pain and has the effect of suppressing somatosensory evoked potentials  . While there are studies reporting increased activity in somatosensory cortex to painful stimulation for individuals with chronic pain relative to normal individuals  , it is possible that in the high pain condition in our study, the individuals with chronic pain may be using acquired pain coping strategies that suppress activity within the somatosensory cortex. Indeed, there have been several studies in which higher pain thresholds are found for individuals with chronic back pain  ,  . 

It is also possible that chronic pain individuals have some degree of residual pain when stimulated that extends longer than healthy normal individuals. Indeed it has been conjectured that chronic pain may resemble that of a persistent memory trace that cannot be extinguished  ,  . It may also be the case that the somatosensory cortex always has some degree of activation in chronic pain individuals associated with their chronic sensation of pain in the absence of any stimulation. This heightened response in the resting state may also result in less differential activity for the chronic pain individuals relative to healthy normal individuals. There is some evidence that the resting state networks of individuals with chronic pain may be different from that of normal healthy controls  ,  ,  . Several aspects of this differential activity need clarification in further research. 

It is important to ensure that the classification performance of a decoder is the result of the features under investigation and not due to some extraneous confound that may be present between the chronic pain group and normal groups. One potential confound that could exist between the two groups is greater head movement in the MRI scanner for individuals with chronic pain. However, statistical analysis of the six realignment parameters did not reveal any differences between the chronic pain and normal control groups (See   and  ). 

An additional confound that one may expect under equal pain conditions is differing levels of stimulation between the two groups. Some studies have shown that pain sensitivity is a correlate of chronic pain status  . When controlling for age, gender, and ethnicity, we did not find any significant difference in the mean threshold level of electrical stimulation between the chronic pain and the normal control groups. Finding no difference between the two groups is desirable, the results of the SLR decoder cannot simply be explained by differential activation in brain regions resulting from different stimulation levels. Indeed the analysis in which the brain activity was weighted by each individual’s pain threshold level, showed no significant difference between the chronic pain group and the normal control group. While some studies have shown lower thresholds for pain in individuals suffering from chronic low back pain  ,   this is not always the case  ,  ,  . In the study conducted by   no difference in electrical stimulation pain thresholds were detected between individuals with chronic low back pain and normal controls. It has also been shown in some studies that individuals with chronic low back pain have higher heat pain thresholds than normal controls  ,  . Given the individual variability and the inconsistency in the published literature on the direction and significance of the difference between individuals with chronic low back pain and normal controls it is unlikely that pain threshold level will serve as a good diagnostic measure above that of the fMRI based SLR decoder presented here. 

It has been shown that there are differences in the pain associated neural activity using different modalities of stimulation  . There are also differences in the temporal characteristics of the onset of the perception of pain with electric being immediate and thermal slower. Because we used only one type of stimulation modality it is possible that the differences in brain activity used by the classifier to distinguish between chronic pain and normal individuals may be a result of brain activity to properties of stimulation that are separate from those of processing induced acute pain. However we do not believe this to be the case here for the following reasons: 1. There was no statistically significant difference in the pain threshold levels used for stimulation for the chronic pain and normal control group. 2. The between-subject analysis in which brain activity was weighted by pain threshold level was not significant in the voxels selected by the SLR decoder (small volume correction analyses using a radius of 8 mm were also not found to be significant) between the chronic pain group and the normal control group. Both of these findings make it unlikely that general properties of stimulation are responsible for the classification performance reported in our study. Rather the results are more consistent with differences between chronic pain and normal individuals in the processes related to the perception of induced acute pain. Even if is found that the ability to discriminate individuals with chronic pain from normal individuals does not generalize to other modalities of stimulation it would not change the relevance of the results of our classification performance using SLR to distinguish between chronic pain and normal individuals using electrical stimulation. 


## Conclusions 
  
The combination of the experimental design and the multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data presented in this study allowed us to recognize brain markers for chronic pain. The experimental method of using contrast images of painful stimulation versus rest enabled us to successfully identify the presence of chronic pain. This provides further evidence that individuals with chronic pain process induced pain differently from normal individuals and that this difference may arise from reorganization in brain processes resulting from the pathology. This study employs the use of multivariate pattern analysis techniques, specifically sparse logistic regression SLR  , to overcome problems of over-fitting and to successfully classify individuals with chronic pain from normal control individuals with 92.3% classification accuracy with high sensitivity and specificity ( ). While a small sample size was used, only 13 individuals in each group, the unbiased analysis methods performed in this study suggest that these results should be reliable and valid for classifying new individuals using this procedure. Future studies need to be conducted using larger group sizes with greater variability in population demographic variables such as race, gender, and age. With the use of a larger sample size the posterior probability interval will decrease around the mean posterior accuracy providing a more precise predictive measure. 

Future studies should explore the effects that different forms of noxious stimulation (thermal, pressure, electric) and different levels of stimulation (equal physical level, equal just noticeable pain threshold, equal high pain threshold) have on classification performance. The general applicability of the classifier would be greatly enhanced if it were found that different types of stimulation could be used for testing even though the classifier is only trained on a specific type of stimulation being used. In the work conducted by   the classifier trained to detect the presence of acute pain using thermal stimulation was able to generalize to detect acute pain using an opiate analgesic. Future studies should determine whether the classifier generalizes across data collected on different MRI scanners. 

In the present study only muscle-skeletal chronic low back pain was investigated. It would be interesting in future studies to determine if classifiers can generalize across different types of chronic pain, whether certain types of chronic pain are more easily classified, and whether performance of the classifiers can be enhanced by specifically training on each type of chronic pain. 

This study presents a method by which chronic pain can be diagnosed from fMRI contrast images acquired in response to induced acute pain. The brain-based markers determined by multivariate pattern analysis can be used to objectively determine whether an individual has chronic pain. This could have great clinical significance in the diagnosis and treatment of individuals suffering from chronic pain.

# Title

Brain Correlates of Experience-Dependent Changes in Stimulus Discrimination Based on the Amount and Schedule of Exposure

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
One product of simple exposure to similar visual stimuli is that they become easier to distinguish. The early visual cortex and other brain areas (such as the prefrontal cortex) have been implicated in such perceptual learning effects, but the anatomical specificity within visual cortex and the relationship between sensory cortex and other brain areas has yet to be examined. Moreover, while variations in the schedule (rather than merely the amount) of exposure influence experience-dependent improvement in discrimination, the neural sequelae of exposure schedule have not been fully investigated. In an event-related fMRI study, participants were exposed to confusable pairs of faces, scenes and dot patterns, using either intermixed or blocked presentation schedules. Participants then performed same/different judgements with exposed and novel pairs of stimuli. Stimulus independent activation, which was correlated with experience-dependent improvement in discrimination, was seen in frontal areas (e.g. frontal and supplementary eye fields and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and in early visual cortex (V1-4). In all regions, the difference in activation between exposed and novel stimuli decreased as a function of the degree of discrimination improvement. Overall levels of BOLD activation differed across regions, consistent with the possibility that, as a consequence of experience, processing shifts from initial engagement of early visual regions to higher order visual areas. Similar relationships were observed when contrasting intermixed with blocked exposure, suggesting that the schedule of exposure primarily influences the degree of, rather than the mechanisms for, discrimination performance.

## Introduction 
  
It is well established that simply giving participants exposure to stimuli results in an improvement in the subsequent ability to discriminate between those stimuli (for reviews see  – ). This experience-dependent change in discriminability is one example of perceptual learning which Gibson defined as “any relatively permanent and consistent change in the perception of a stimulus array, following practice or experience with this array” (Gibson,  , p. 29; see also Goldstone,  , p. 585). Following Gibson, the study of experience-dependent changes in discriminability has been pursued in two partially independent traditions. One, influenced by an associative perspective, has focused on the role of stimulus comparison using analogous procedures in animals and humans, utilising a range of relatively complex stimuli (e.g., flavours  ,  ; faces  ; checkerboards  ,  ; visual scenes  ). The other, being generally characterized by the use of simpler stimuli within a psychophysical tradition, has demonstrated that perceptual learning can be specific to particular stimulus features (e.g., size  ; orientation  ; texture  ; retinotopic location  ; for reviews involving perceptual learning in other modalities, see  ,  ). In addition to the nature of the stimuli that are presented, it is also notable that experiments from the psychophysical tradition typically involve extended stimulus exposure and/or training over a period of hours or days, with feedback to the participant. Whereas those influenced by the associative tradition, (e.g.,  – ,  ), typically involve less extended exposure, without explicit feedback. Despite these apparent differences, results from both methodological backgrounds reveal the benefit of stimulus exposure on subsequent perception, and have proposed similar mechanisms to explain this learning  – ,  . For an extended analysis of these two traditions and the relationships and differences between them see Dwyer and Mundy  . 

While there has been little work on the brain correlates of experience-dependent improvements in discrimination from within an associative tradition, the stimulus specificity effects from within the psychophysical tradition  –  are consistent with the view that perceptual learning is based upon changes in primary sensory cortex where receptive fields are relatively small and feature specific (but see,  – ). This view receives direct support from functional imaging studies that have implicated early visual regions in perceptual learning. For example, Schiltz and colleagues  , using PET, reported a reduction in activation in visual cortex following extended training with contrast discrimination. Similarly, Mukai and colleagues  , in an fMRI study, found a decrease in activity in the visual cortex after training with sinusoidal gratings (there were also changes in the activity of “attentional” regions such as frontal and supplementary eye-fields and dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex). In this latter study, participants who improved on the discrimination task (‘learners’) showed a reduction in visual cortex activation (and areas belonging to the attentional network) that correlated with the magnitude of perceptual learning. In contrast, participants who failed to improve on the task (‘nonlearners’) showed no changes in brain activation during learning. 

The studies described above highlight a role for visual cortex in perceptual learning that is evident as reductions in activity after training (see also  ). However, other studies have observed increases in activity for exposed or trained stimuli versus novel stimuli (1 month training, low contrast patterns, early visual cortex increase  ; 24 hours training, texture discrimination, early visual cortex increase  ). The basis for these opposing changes in activation in the primary visual cortex after stimulus exposure is unclear. However, one potential explanation relies on the assumption that these studies have measured different regions in the visual cortex, which might differentially change as a consequence of experience. We investigated this explanation, in terms of anatomical specificity, by assessing different regions of visual cortex with retinotopic mapping, and examining whether or not any changes in activity therein relate to the degree of discrimination improvement produced by stimulus exposure (see  ). Moreover, as noted above associative and psychophysical investigations of perceptual learning typically differ with respect to the overall amount of exposure and the complexity of the stimuli. By using fMRI with relatively brief exposure to complex stimuli we will be able to assess whether the neural sequelae of this type of experience are related to discrimination improvement in the same way as with extended exposure to simple stimuli. 

A complimentary aim of this study was to examine the extent to which any changes (increases or decreases) in activation were related to stimulus familiarity   per se  . One simple explanation for perceptual learning, which stems from within an associative tradition, relies on the idea that it is a direct function of the frequency with which the stimuli are encountered (i.e., their familiarity  ,  ). However, this idea cannot explain the fact that different   schedules   of exposure (that match for the overall   amount   of exposure) result in differences in the improvement in discrimination. For example, Honey, Bateson and Horn ( ; see also  ) demonstrated that animals exposed to two stimuli in an intermixed fashion (i.e. A, A*, A, A*, …) subsequently acquired a discrimination between them more readily than a second group of animals that received an equivalent amount of exposure to the stimuli but arranged in blocks (i.e. A, A, … A*, A*,). Such effects of exposure schedule have since been replicated in animal and human studies across a range of stimuli, demonstrating that the experience-dependent changes in discrimination cannot be solely a product of stimuli familiarity (for a recent review, see  ). The theoretical basis of such a scheduling effect remains a matter of debate (see below); and this debate is mirrored by the fact that we do not know whether the improvements in discrimination that are produced by different types of stimulus exposure are mediated by the same brain substrates. 

One of the earliest theoretical accounts of perceptual learning, that anticipated the advantage of intermixed over blocked exposure, was provided by Gibson  ,  . She suggested that perceptual learning depends on the process of stimulus differentiation; more specifically, the effectiveness of the features that are unique to each of the exposed stimuli are enhanced relative to those features that are shared or common to both. More recently, we have suggested that this differentiation process might be understood in terms of the differential adaptation of stimulus-unique and stimulus-common features (e.g.  ,  ,  ; but see also  ,  ). Briefly, according to this analysis, the response to common elements will adapt more quickly than the response to unique features because the common features are present on every trial. This difference will result in the unique features being better attended to and processed and will, in turn, result in them being more readily integrated into a long-term representation of the stimulus. Although the evidence suggesting an interaction between adaptation and exposure-dependant improvements in discrimination in our studies is relatively indirect, there is now more direct evidence to support such an interaction from motion-direction discrimination tasks  . The fact that the schedule of exposure has an equivalent effect on the improvement in discrimination across a range of stimuli might be taken to imply that shared brain mechanisms are involved (see  ). Although some preliminary evidence suggests that common brain mechanisms are involved across different types of visual stimuli  , this study examined only two stimulus types (faces and checkerboards) and involved too few participants to afford a powerful analysis of brain-behaviour relationships. Thus, the final aim for the current study was to examine the extent to which improvements in discrimination involving different classes of visual stimulus is supported by shared brain mechanisms. 

To summarise: The three main aims of this study were to: (i) use retinotopic mapping techniques to determine the involvement of sub-regions within the visual cortex in the discrimination improvement following brief exposure to complex stimuli; (ii) investigate whether the schedule of exposure affects the brain mechanisms recruited; and (iii) examine the extent to which the brain mechanisms (in visual cortex and elsewhere) recruited are common across different types of visual stimuli. The design of the study is summarized in  . It involved giving participants intermixed exposure to two pairs of similar stimuli and blocked exposure to a further two pairs. The effects of this unsupervised exposure training were tested by examining the ability to discriminate within the intermixed and blocked pairs, in comparison to the ability to discriminate within two novel pairs of stimuli. This procedure was repeated with dot stimuli, morphed faces and virtual reality scenes. MRI data acquisition was performed during the test phase with a retinotopic mapping sequence performed in a separate session. Contrasting intermixed exposure with novel stimuli provides an assessment of experience-dependent improvement in discrimination. In this case, the effect of experience is based upon a within-subjects comparison, but is evident as a difference in performance between stimuli (exposed and novel). Contrasting the improvement in discrimination between stimuli experienced in intermixed and blocked schedules assesses effects of experience over and above those that reflect mere familiarity. Comparison of the three types of stimuli (for both the intermixed vs novel, and intermixed vs blocked comparisons) assesses the degree to which the brain mechanisms recruited by experience are stimulus general. Finally, correlating the behavioural effects of stimulus exposure on test performance with the fMRI results allows assessment of the relationship between the degree of experience-dependent improvement in discrimination and key brain substrates.

## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Sixteen right-handed healthy participants (10 male) were scanned. Participants ranged from 18 to 40 years old (mean = 30.1 years) and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. This work received ethical approval from the School of Psychology (Cardiff University) ethics committee. All participants gave informed, written consent and were paid for their participation. 


### Materials 
  
Dot patterns, faces and scenes were used in both the pre-exposure and discrimination conditions. A computer program, written in Visual Basic , was used to generate twelve pairs of confusable dot patterns. The program was constrained to create an initial random pattern of 11 dots. A second confusable pattern was made by making random adjustments to the location of 4 dots in the original image within a range of 50 pixels. The face stimuli were created using a morphing software package called Morpheus 1.85 (ACD Systems, Saanichiton, British Columbia, Canada) running on an IBM-compatible PC. Twelve face pairs (6 pairs of men and 6 pairs of women) were created by selecting exemplars that were close together on a morph continuum between photos of two different individuals. This process is reported in more detail in Mundy et al.  . The scene stimuli consisted of twelve pairs of computer-generated virtual rooms. The pairs of rooms were made confusable by creating each pair from the same prototype, but ensuring that within the pair there were differences in the size, orientation and/or location of one or more of the features of the room (e.g. a window, staircase, wall cavity). The rooms were created using a commercially available computer game (Deus Ex, Ion Storm L.P., Austin, TX, USA) and a freeware software editor (Deus Ex Software Development Kit v1112f). Further details on how both faces and scenes were presented on screen are identical to those reported in Mundy et al.  . An example of the stimuli used can be found in  . All stimuli were presented at the centre of the screen; the on-screen dimension of all images was 15×12 degrees of visual angle (height × width), with a fixation distance of 57 cm. Participants were asked to fixate centrally, aided by a crosshair presented during inter-trial intervals. Response times and accuracy were automatically recorded via button box in order that individual trials could be accurately classified for an event-related analysis of the fMRI data.

### Experimental Design & Procedure 
  
The experimental design is summarized in  . This design was run six times, twice with each type of stimulus (dots, faces and scenes), with stimulus-type order counterbalanced across participants. This arrangement was split across two scanning acquisition runs, each containing one version of each stimulus type. The twelve stimulus pairs produced for each condition were therefore split into two batches of six stimulus pairs. The stimulus batch was changed between experiment repetitions and counterbalanced across participants so that all stimulus pairs appeared equally often in each condition (intermixed, blocked and novel). For each stimulus type, the experiment took place in two stages: ‘exposure’, where participants were given experience of some stimulus pairs; and ‘test’, where discrimination between the members of exposed and novel-at-test pairs was assessed. Before exposure, participants were given the following instructions: “You will now see a series of images, some will be very similar, please play close attention–the differences are very subtle. Please try and keep your gaze to the centre of the screen (indicated by a crosshair)”. During the exposure stage (given in the scanner but with no data acquired), participants were given exposure to pairs of stimuli in two exposure-schedule conditions. In the intermixed condition, the two images in a pair were presented in alternation. In the blocked condition, two pairs of items were presented, with all presentations of one image in the pair preceded by those of the second image in that pair. The order in which these within-subjects conditions were presented was counterbalanced across participants and runs. Each presented image was shown 5 times for 2 seconds each with a 1 second ISI. This amount of exposure produces differences in discrimination between exposed and novel stimuli and between stimuli presented on intermixed and clocked schedules (e.g.  ,  ,  ,  ). The remaining two pairs of items in each stimulus condition were only presented during the test stage of the experiment, and were thus ‘novel’ at the outset of testing. 

The test phase, which immediately followed exposure, consisted of a same/different discrimination task in which two stimuli were presented in succession: on each trial they were either two copies of the same stimulus (i.e. A, A) or two different stimuli (from the same pair, i.e. A*, A) and the participants were requested to indicate if they were the same or not by pressing the relevant key of the response box. Participants saw the following instructions before the test phase commenced: “You will now see a second series of faces, some will be new. The image will flash–please indicate whether you think the image has changed. Press the left button to indicate that you saw the images change (i.e., they were different). Press the right button to indicate that the images did not change (i.e., they were the same)”. The first stimulus was shown for 500 ms, followed by a 300 ms ISI that was filled by a high contrast random mask image, and then the second stimulus was presented for 500 ms. The offset of the second stimulus triggered a 2-sec response window (when the screen was blank), followed by a random ITI of between 2.5 and 10 sec sampled from a Poisson distribution, during which time a central fixation cross was presented. The test phase was conducted with 16 trials for each stimulus-pair (8 same, 8 different). The order of trials was randomised with the constraint that there must be four trials from each condition in every 16 trials. After every 16 trials, a fixation cross appeared for 20 seconds to allow the participant to rest. Following the main experiment, each participant was given a high-resolution structural scan. Additionally, 12 of the 16 participants underwent a retinotopic mapping sequence (for details of this protocol, see  ,  ), undertaken in a second scanning session between 1 and 7 days later. The 4 participants who did not receive a retinotopic scan were unavailable to return for this second session. These participants were thus excluded from retinotopic analyses, but were included in all other analyses. 


### Data Acquisition 
  
Imaging was performed on a General Electric 3-T HDx MRI system using an 8-channel receive-only head coil. For functional imaging a T2*-weighted gradient-echo, echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence was used to image volumes with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast. Fifty slices were collected per image volume covering the whole brain, prescribed 30 degrees inclined from the AC-PC plane. Scanning parameters were: repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) 3,000/35 ms; flip angle (FA) 90 degrees; slice thickness 2.8 mm (1 mm gap); acquisition matrix GE-EPI 64×64; in-plane field of view 22 cm; ASSET (acceleration factor) 2. Additional high-resolution field maps were also acquired for every participant, for the purpose of un-distorting the EPI datasets during image pre-processing. For anatomic localization, a structural scan was made for each participant using a T1-weighted sequence (3D FSPGR). Scanning parameters were: TR/TE 7.9/3.0 ms; FA 20 degrees; acquisition matrix 256×256×176, field of view 256×256×176 mm, 1 mm isotropic resolution. 


### Data Pre-processing 
  
Data pre-processing and statistical analysis of fMRI data was carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 5.63, part of FSL (FMRIB’s Software Library,  ). The following pre-statistics processing was applied; motion correction using MCFLIRT  ; non-brain removal using BET  ; spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 4 mm; mean-based intensity normalisation of all volumes by the same factor; highpass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting, with sigma = 20.0 s); un-distorting the EPI data to correct for magnetic field distortions by means of individual fieldmaps. Time-series statistical analysis was carried out using FILM with local autocorrelation correction  . Registration to high resolution 3D anatomical T1 scans (per participant) and to a standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template image (for group average) were carried out using FLIRT  ,  . 


### Data Analysis 
  
#### Behavioural Analysis 
  
The primary measure of performance was response accuracy (percentage of correct responses during discrimination testing). This was calculated on a within-subject basis as a function of exposure type (intermixed, blocked, novel) and stimulus type (faces, dots, scenes) averaged over both scanning runs. In order to assess any effects of the speed of responding (e.g., speed accuracy trade-offs), reaction times were also examined in the same manner. 


#### Imaging: General Group Analysis 
  
After pre-processing each individual subject’s fMRI time series, the data were submitted to a (random effects) general linear model, with one predictor that was convolved with a standard model of the haemodynamic response function (HRF) for each event-type/condition. Only data from the discrimination test phase were analysed: consequently, the event-types/regressors (a total of 9) were defined by the exposure history of each discrimination event (‘intermixed dots’; ‘blocked dots’; ‘novel dots’; ‘intermixed faces’; ‘blocked faces’; ‘novel faces’; ‘intermixed scenes’; ‘blocked scenes’ and ‘novel scenes’). The parameter estimates relating to the height of the HRF response to each event-type were calculated on a voxel by voxel basis, via a multiple linear regression of the response time course, to create one beta image for each event-type per participant, per run. These parameter estimates, characterising the extent to which a region was activated by the event-type, were used as the basis for our analyses by including them in a higher-level (group) FLAME analysis (FMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects  ,  ). 


#### Planned data analyses 
  
First, BOLD activity resulting from stimulus independent exposure learning was defined in a whole-brain analysis by contrasting intermixed stimuli (intermixed dots + intermixed faces + intermixed scenes) with novel-at-test stimuli (novel dots + novel faces + novel scenes), for each individual. Then, FEAT’s (gaussianised)   t  -statistics were converted to   z   statistics and thresholded using clusters determined by   z  >3 and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   p   = 0.05  . To test for any stimulus-specific effects, the same whole-brain analysis was then repeated for each of the stimulus types individually. To obtain a group average for each of these contrasts, the data were submitted to a further FLAME analysis. 

To assess the contribution of distinct early visual regions to the effects of stimulus exposure, and to allow a more detailed assessment of which early visual areas may contribute to degree of learning, the individual retinotopic maps (N = 12) were scrutinised to identify areas V1–V4 in each hemisphere (see  ,  ). Since all stimuli were centrally presented, the centre of each region (close to the foveal representation) was identified by eye, according to careful analysis of the pattern of striation in each individual’s retinotopic map. The map was represented as a cortical flatmap with areas of activity delineated by selectivity to visual field meridian. The voxel closest to this point was used to define the centre point for a subsequent manually defined region of interest (ROI) constructed from the set of contiguous voxels within 6 mm in the anterior/posterior, superior/inferior and medial/lateral direction of this co-ordinate. Where retinotopic regions were further sub-divided by the retinotopic map (i.e. V2dorsal/V2ventral, V3/V3a/V3b/Vp), ROIs were defined for each sub-division and data were later averaged across them. Voxel numbers in each ROI were matched. Using these retinotopic ROIs, each participant’s individual data was queried to obtain a parameter estimate in each of the visual regions within the exposure contrast [intermixed stimuli versus novel stimuli] for each stimulus type, in each hemisphere. 

In order to examine exposure effects in previously reported frontoparietal areas (e.g.,  ,  ,  ), and to evaluate those regions identified in our own whole-brain analyses, several candidate regions were defined anatomically in reference to the atlas of Talairach and Tournoux   in all 16 participants: intraparietal sulcus (IPS; Talairach coordinates x, y, z: ±26, −65, 39), frontal eye field (FEF; ±41, 2, 47), supplementary eye field (SEF; ±3, −1, 60), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; ±23, 42, 36). The subsequent ROI for each region was defined as the set of contiguous voxels that were within 6 mm in the anterior/posterior, superior/inferior and medial/lateral directions of voxel closest to the anatomical centre (i.e., a 3×3×3 voxel cube). The validity of such regions to areas of activity seen in our own whole-brain data was assured by cross-checking the proximity of the central voxel of these anatomically defined ROIs with the peak voxel of clusters identified within the above whole-brain analysis, to ensure good correspondence. A series of   t  -tests supported this correspondence, by indicating that anatomically defined regions did not differ significantly in any (x, y, z) direction (maximum   t   (15) = 1.75,   p  >0.1) from significant clusters seen in group-average whole brain analyses. Using these anatomical ROIs, as before, each participant’s individual data was queried to obtain a parameter estimate in each of these regions within the learning contrast [intermixed stimuli versus novel stimuli] for each stimulus type, in each hemisphere. 

In order to investigate the possibility that activity in brain regions resulting from exposure to the stimuli might be modulated by individual differences in discrimination improvement, correlations between individual parameter estimates and a behavioural measure of discrimination improvement were made for each frontoparietal and visual ROI. The behavioural measure was defined as an individual’s score on exposed intermixed discriminations minus their score on novel discriminations; thus a larger difference equates to greater improvement in stimulus discrimination (a greater benefit to performance of exposure compared to a no exposure baseline). For the subsequent analysis of the effect of exposure schedule on discrimination improvement (as opposed to the amount of exposure), the above methodology was repeated in full, replacing novel stimuli with blocked stimuli. In this way, all contrasts became a test of the sequence of presentation [intermixed stimuli versus blocked stimuli] rather than the amount of presentation (i.e., exposed versus novel). It should be noted that all these analyses make comparisons across different exposure conditions. We have already reported the results of an, entirely orthogonal, analysis based on differences within exposure conditions and stimulus-types  . 




## Results 
  
### Behavioural Data 
  
 shows the discrimination scores for the nine conditions. Discriminations involving pairs of images that were exposed in an intermixed (and blocked) fashion were more accurate than those involving pairs of images that were novel. Similarly, intermixed exposure resulted in better performance than blocked. There was, however, little evidence of performance differences on discriminations across different stimuli type. Consistent with this description of the results, analysis of variance revealed a main effect of exposure condition (  F  (2, 30) = 12.9,   p<  0.01), but no overall effect of stimulus category (  F  <1) and no interaction (  F  <1). Collapsing across stimuli, analysis of the simple main effects confirmed that performance in each of the two exposed conditions was better than in the novel condition (minimum   F  (1,15) = 31.2,   p  <0.01), and that performance in the intermixed condition was more proficient than in the blocked condition (  F  (1,15) = 14.9,   p  <0.01). Additionally, when the behavioural data were split, so that performance in the first half of the test phase was compared with performance in the second half (i.e., a broad examination of learning across test) ANOVA revealed a main effect of test phase (early vs late   F  (1, 15) = 22.7,   p  <0.01), but this did not interact with exposure schedule (  F  <1). Investigating a comparable split half analysis in our imaging data was not possible due to lack of power for this kind of contrast, however given the behavioral data indicate no interaction between the main effects of test phase and schedule it would appear that the effects of exposure gained at test are simply added to the effects of the explicit manipulation of exposure in the previous stage of the experiments.

   Behavioural reaction time data for each condition (seconds), with SEM.      
The behavioural data indicating the most marked improvement in discrimination involved the comparison of intermixed and novel stimuli. In order to gain the clearest picture of the brain effects of this experience-dependant improvement in discrimination we began by comparing these two conditions. Later, we turn to the comparison of the intermixed and blocked conditions. Whilst these analyses were the most appropriate for the questions at hand, there were several other potential comparisons: for example, intermixed and blocked conditions can be combined to create an ‘exposed’ condition, which can be contrasted with novel stimuli. This contrast will not be reported in detail, but it is worth noting that there were no significant differences in cortical regions activated, between this comparison and the intermixed versus novel comparison which we report in detail here. As will be described in detail below, with one exception, the general pattern of results from the intermixed versus novel comparison, and intermixed versus blocked comparison, was the same. 


### Imaging Data 
  
#### Stimulus independent improvements in discrimination whole brain analysis: Intermixed stimuli versus novel stimuli 
  
In order to examine stimulus-independent improvements in discrimination, data from discriminations involving intermixed stimuli were contrasted with data from discriminations involving the novel stimuli, collapsed across stimulus type (see   and  ). This contrast revealed a significant area of activation in the occipital pole that extended into the medial inferior occipital gyrus and lingual gyrus (overlapping V1 and V2, according to the Jülich histological atlas in FSL  ). The reverse contrast revealed significant clusters of activation in: lateral occipital and lingual gyri (overlapping V3 and V4); intraparietal sulcus; superior frontal gyrus (at the junction of the pre-central sulcus, encompassing the frontal eye field); mid frontal gyrus, extending to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; precuneus; and cingulate gyrus (extending to the upper part of the paracentral sulcus, containing the supplementary eye field). Subsequently, a conjunction analysis was performed in order to confirm that activity in these regions is truly stimulus-independent. Activity to each stimulus type was independently contrasted with baseline activity, resulting in three statistical masks (using a   p  <0.05 threshold within each analysis). Then, a conjunction mask was created by intersecting these three masks, identifying regions that were significantly activated by all three stimulus types (  p  <0.05, corrected for multiple comparsions). This conjunction analysis confirmed the above observations, indicating no differences in the areas reported above when directly comparing experience-dependant discrimination improvement across stimulus types (i.e., examining stimulus-selective processing), indicating these regions are stimulus-independent. However, it must also be noted that other brain regions, further along the ventral visual stream (known to be involved in exposure learning effects in a stimulus-specific way) differed when comparing stimulus types in the current data. For example, learning with face stimuli activated the fusiform gyrus and perirhinal cortex and scene stimuli activated the parahippocampal gyrus and posterior hippocampus. As we have discussed such activations elsewhere (see  ,  ), we will focus on purely stimulus-independent activity here.

The most relevant visual sub-regions for this experiment are marked within  . Regions of interest were defined for each of these sub-regions in both hemispheres of every participant.   shows average beta difference scores (i.e., intermixed exposed activity minus activity to novel stimuli) for the exposure contrast in each of the main retinotopic regions, for each stimulus type (collapsed across hemisphere for clarity). Both V1 and V2 respond more to intermixed than novel conditions, whilst V3 and V4 show the opposite pattern. There appears to be no effect of stimulus type on activity in any of the regions. To check that these regions (and thus the relationship between activity and behaviour) were truly stimulus-independent and that there were no hemispheric differences in activity, the beta values [intermixed minus novel] for each early visual ROI were submitted to a three-way ANOVA with factors of hemisphere, subregion and stimulus-type. The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of sub-region (  F  (3, 33) = 46.2,   p  <0.01), but no effects of stimulus-type or hemisphere or any interactions (  F  s<1).

#### Stimulus independent activity correlated with behavioural performance 
  
In order to gain a better understanding of the activity associated with stimulus independent discrimination improvement, and to assess whether or not it varied according to individual behavioural performance, parameter estimates from the exposure contrast in frontoparietal and early visual regions of interest were correlated with behavioural performance: 

 Early visual regions  .   shows a correlation between our behavioural measure (X-axis) and activity in each of the visual cortex sub-regions (V1–V4; Y-axis). Inspection of the figure shows that differential exposure-related activity in all regions was negatively correlated with behavioural performance. The greater the difference between intermixed and novel discriminations, the less activity is seen in all measured regions of the visual cortex, albeit from different starting baselines. More specifically, V1 and V2 show greater activity to intermixed-exposed than novel stimuli for participants showing the lowest amount of discrimination improvement, but this activity difference reduces as the level of discrimination improvement increases. Areas V3 and V4 are not differentially activated for participants who show low levels of discrimination improvement, but decreased activity for intermixed-exposed compared with novel stimuli emerged as the level of discrimination improvement increased. Pearson correlations confirm this description of the results: V1,   r   = −0.607,   p  <0.05; V2,   r   = −0.748,   p  <0.01; V3,   r   = −0.754,   p  <0.01; V4,   r   = −0.685,   p  <0.05. To focus on the extremes of the discrimination improvement continuum, if a particular participant was showed only a small improvement in discrimination with exposure, they showed strong activation in V1/2 and little, if any reduction in activity in V3/4 when making discriminations about pre-exposed (versus novel) stimuli. In contrast, participants who displayed large improvements in discrimination with exposure tended to show little V1/2 activation and much greater reduction in activity in V3/4 when making equivalent discriminations. 

 Frontoparietal regions.   Regions of interest were defined bilaterally for the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), frontal eye field (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; according to previously published co-ordinates and anatomical landmarks, in the manner described above; see  ). ANOVA confirmed there were no effects of stimulus-type or hemisphere in each of these regions (  F  s<1), indicating that activity in these areas is stimulus-independent. There was, however, a main effect of exposure [intermixed versus novel] (  F  (3,33) = 43.9   p  <0.01). This main effect was supported by significant differences between novel and intermixed trials in each of the four ROIs (minimum   F  (1,15) = 15.6   p  <0.01).   shows a correlation between our behavioural measure (accuracy on intermixed trials minus accuracy on novel trials) and activity (contrasting intermixed trials with novel trials) in each of the attention-related ROIs, collapsed across hemisphere. Inspection of the figure shows that all regions are negatively correlated with behavioural performance: The greater the difference between accuracy on exposed and non-exposed discriminations, the greater the reduction in activity is seen in all measured regions. Pearson correlation confirms this analysis: IPS,   r   = −0.684,   p  <0.05; FEF,   r   = −0.825,   p  <0.01; SEF,   r   = −0.692,   p  <0.05; DLPFC,   r   = −0.747,   p  <0.01. 


#### The effect of schedule on the neural correlates of discrimination improvement: Intermixed stimuli versus blocked stimuli 
  
The effect of schedule was assessed by contrasting intermixed exposed stimuli with blocked exposed stimuli (i.e., from trials where discrimination is based upon the same amount of exposure to the stimuli, but under differing schedules). This schedule contrast produced no extra areas of activity to the exposure contrast explained above. Both contrasts revealed broadly similar clusters over the whole brain analysis, albeit with lower   z   scores in the intermixed versus blocked compared to intermixed versus novel contrast. A small cluster of voxels in early visual cortex, however, failed to show activation in this schedule contrast, yet were activated in the exposure-based contrast above. 

 Early visual regions  : Close inspection of the retinotopic mapping data revealed that this discrepancy appeared to be in areas V1 and V2. An ANOVA on the parameter estimates from each condition in each ROI with factors of contrast (exposure or schedule) and region (V1–4) revealed a main effect of region (  F  (3, 33) = 12.44,   p  <0.01), contrast (  F  (1, 11) = 18.91,   p  <0.01) and an interaction (  F  (3, 33) = 8.35,   p  <0.01). Analysis of the simple effects of this interaction confirmed that in V3 and V4 there was no significant difference between exposure and schedule activity (largest   F =   1.70,   p   = 0.218), whereas V1 and V2 activity differed significantly when comparing exposure and schedule (minimum   F  (2, 10) = 9.73,   p  <0.01). 

A correlational analysis between behavioural performance and ROI-generated V1–4 parameter estimates (equivalent to the exposure-based analysis explained above and using identical ROI co-ordinates for each participant) was performed on the schedule data. Behavioural performance was measured, in this case, as the percentage difference between discrimination performance to previously intermixed stimuli and previously blocked stimuli. A large difference can be understood as a strong effect of exposure schedule on subsequent discrimination (i.e., a participant who benefits more from intermixed than blocked exposure, despite the equivalent amount of exposure to the stimuli). Parameter estimates were taken for each early-visual ROI from the image generated by contrasting all intermixed conditions (dots, faces and scenes) with all blocked conditions. Inspection of   indicates that whilst V3 and V4 show a negative relationship with behavioural performance (similar to that documented above), V1 and V2 do not; in fact there is instead a weak positive relationship (in contrast to the pattern shown above). Pearson correlations confirm this description of the results: V1,   r   = 0.243,   p   = 0.45; V2,   r   = 0.321,   p   = 0.31; V3,   r   = −0.794,   p  <0.01; V4,   r   = −0.609,   p  <0.05. Thus, for participants who only exhibited a small benefit of intermixed exposure over blocked exposure, at a behavioural level, there was no activation of V1/2 and only weak reductions in activity in V3/4. In contrast, for participants with a larger benefit of intermixed over blocked exposure there were greater reductions in V3/4 activity (i.e., intermixed < blocked), but still little difference in V1/2 activity levels. 

 Frontoparietial regions:   Frontoparietal regions of interest, described above, were also directly assessed for schedule effects. ANOVA once again confirmed there were no effects of stimulus-type or hemisphere in each of these regions (largest   F   = 1.40,   p   = 0.291), indicating that schedule-related activity in these areas is stimulus-independent. A further ANOVA on the parameter estimates in each ROI, collapsed across stimulus type and hemisphere, with factors of contrast (exposure or schedule) and region (IPS; FEF; SEF; DLPFC) revealed no significant main effects, or interaction (largest   F   = 1.92,   p   = 0.146).   shows a correlation between behaviour (accuracy on intermixed trials minus accuracy on blocked trials) and activity (contrasting intermixed trials with blocked trials) in each of the attention-related ROIs, collapsed across hemisphere. Similarly to the effect of our exposure-based analysis above, inspection of the figure shows that all regions are negatively correlated with behavioural performance. Pearson correlation confirms this analysis: IPS,   r   = −0.606,   p  <0.05; FEF,   r   = −0.601,   p  <0.05; SEF,   r   = −0.670,   p  <0.01; DLPFC,   r   = −0.637,   p  <0.01. 




## Discussion 
  
As noted in the  , perceptual learning refers to the influence of experience on discrimination and it has been investigated using a wide range of procedures. Both brief and extended exposure to visual stimuli improve later discrimination (i.e., produce a perceptual learning effect). One outstanding issue is whether brief and extended exposure to visual stimuli have the same neuronal sequelae. Here, our principle aim was to identify the contribution made by individual sub-regions within visual cortex (in particular V1-V4) to experience-dependent discrimination improvement, while also investigating a broader network of brain regions that might be important. FMRI was used to scan participants during discrimination judgements involving confusable stimulus-pairs of faces, scenes and dot patterns, which had either been exposed in intermixed or blocked schedules, or were initially novel during test. The experiment we report here uses considerably fewer exposure trials and more complex stimulus types than many previous studies that have reported effects of experience on activity within the visual cortex (e.g.,  – ). We will begin by discussing the implications for the understanding of perceptual learning of the stimulus-independent involvement of the visual cortex in discrimination improvement following the brief amount of exposure. We then consider the involvement of frontal/attentional areas, before moving to consider the effects of schedule, rather than amount, of exposure on discrimination improvement. 

### Early visual cortex and stimulus-independent discrimination improvement 
  
Discrimination improvement for all types of exposed stimuli – dot patterns, faces and scenes – was associated with a region of early visual cortex (c.f.  ). Examining the simple effect of exposure to stimuli, we found important differences in how visual sub-regions were recruited: with increases in activity in V1 and V2 (i.e., greater BOLD signal for stimuli exposed in an intermixed fashion compared with to novel stimuli) but a reduction in activity in V3 and V4 (i.e., greater BOLD signal for novel stimuli than the stimuli exposed intermixed). Activity in these regions showed a negative correlation with behavioural performance, albeit with different starting and finishing points. More specifically, there was more activity in V1 and V2 when participants showed a small degree of exposure-dependant improvement in discrimination (as measured by a small difference between accuracy on trials with intermixed and novel stimuli) and a greater reduction in activation in V3 and V4 when there was a significant benefit of exposure (as measured by a large difference between intermixed and novel trials). As will be discussed later, this pattern of results was, by and large, also apparent when the comparison was between stimuli that has been exposed on the same number of occasions, but according to different schedules (intermixed and blocked). 

Experience-related activation in early visual regions with complex stimuli has been reported previously  ,  , and the current study replicates this finding, demonstrating that this activity in these brain areas is not restricted to simple stimuli (e.g., sinusoidal gratings), extended exposure and/or supervision (e.g., feedback during learning  ). There have been reports of reductions in activation with learning (e.g.  – ), as well as other reports of increases in activation with learning (e.g.  ,  ,  ,  ). The current study confirms that both patterns of results can be seen in the same participants, while performing the same perceptual discriminations. Importantly, the two patterns occur in distinct regions. Although V1 and V2 are more active for group average data for exposed than novel stimuli, there are additional visual regions like V3 and V4 that show reduced activity for exposed stimuli. Closer analysis of this data reveals that while V1–V4 all have the same relationship with changes in discrimination performance–behavioural performance is negatively correlated with activity – the broad differences in activation profile reflect differential starting baselines. 

The current data are broadly consistent with Mukai et al. ( , see also  ,  ,  ) who also demonstrated a clear relationship between activity in early visual and overall level of performance. Participants for whom there was evidence of learning showed greater activation in these early visual areas, with this pattern decreasing across training. By the end of training, this group showed less early visual cortex activation than the remaining participants who had shown no evidence of learning. The reduced activation in the participants that learned (compared with those who did not learn) is much like the negative correlations between activity and behavioural performance seen in the current experiment. Importantly, however, our data also indicate that visual sub-regions do not all show the same level of initial activity. So, another source of the discrepancies amongst previous studies is the level of behavioural performance: in situations where improvements in discrimination were limited increases in activation might be expected, whereas marked improvements might lead to decreases in activation. 

The reason behind the initial difference in activity level between V1/2 and V3/4 is unclear, but the fact that the coding of information changes along the visual pathway provides some basis for speculation. For example, V1 and V2 code for local orientation of contours  , while V4 codes for local curvature and configuration of orientations, and higher areas (e.g., lateral occipital cortex) processing global configurations and shape  . Ahissar and Hochstein   propose that perceptual learning (and visual processing more generally) involves a flexible focus on which ever coding system might provide the highest signal to noise ratio for a given task. Combining these ideas leads to the suggestion that the stimuli in this experiment can be discriminated both in terms of very local features (e.g. the positioning of a single dot or orientation of a line in a scene) or by more complex (but still relatively local) features. Using the most simple/local coding system may be inefficient as it might require actively maintaining the representations of a multitude of simple features in order to ascertain if any of them change between images, and thus will have a low signal to noise ratio as most individual features do not actually change. Using the more complex coding system could be more efficient as it requires attending to fewer (but more complex) features, although it may not be the default system to use, particularly early on in learning. As the stimuli become more familiar, however, the visual system may swap from focusing on the coding systems used in V1/2 to those in V3/4, thus resulting in better performance overall. Finally, for this hypothesis to explain the different overall levels of activation across V1–V4 requires the assumption that in V1/2 better performance involves more overall activation (possibly as the result of processing a large number of individual features) whilst in V3/4 it involves less overall activation (possibly by selectively tuning to the configurations relevant to the discrimination). However, whether such a mechanism precedes or results from feedback via stimulus-specific processing known to occur elsewhere in the brain, will be a topic for further experimentation. 


### Frontoparietal regions and attention 
  
In addition to visual areas, regions of frontal and parietal cortex associated with attentional processing were also involved in discrimination improvement independently of stimulus type. These areas were the intraparietal sulcus, frontal eye field, supplementary eye field (cortical areas known to be associated with modulating attentional signals; e.g.  – ) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (which plays an important role in the integration of sensory and mnemonic information and working memory; see for a review  ). These areas are strikingly similar to those found by Mukai et al.  , a study that used much simpler stimuli. Furthermore, like Mukai et al. the current study found that the degree of learning shown by an individual was negatively correlated with the level of activation seen in these attention-related areas of cortex. 

The involvement of attention in perceptual learning (at least with very simple stimuli) has been noted before (e.g.,  ,  ). This involvement is consistent with Gibson’s   interpretation of perceptual learning, who proposed that learning is brought about by ‘guided exploratory activity’ through peripheral attention, in order to reveal ‘aspects of potential stimulation’ (  pg., 63). These perspectives envisage a top-down influence whereby differences in processing at the level of sensory cortex can be attributed to attentional mechanisms. However, the observed attentional differences could also be a product of bottom-up processes. As discussed in more detail below, differential adaptation or habituation of common and unique elements supported by early sensory regions offers one means to direct attention to the features of the stimuli that are most useful for the discrimination (i.e., attention is drawn to the unique elements following habituation of common elements; e.g.,  ,  ,  ). Irrespective of the theoretical interpretation, the current data suggest that weakly learned stimuli place more demands on attentional regions than do better learned stimuli. Similarly, Mukai et al.,   shows that initial learning activated attentional regions far more than learning later on in testing. Whilst unable to differentiate between cause and consequence at present, this information reinforces both the general idea that attentional processes are involved in experience-dependent improvements in discrimination, and that attentional demands decrease as discrimination improves. 

For reasons of clarity this paper has only focused on those areas traditionally associated with visual perceptual learning of simple stimuli (early visual cortex and frontal cortical regions involved in visual attention e.g., see  ). It is important to note, however, that in regions beyond those discussed here, stimulus type does indeed affect the location of neural activity, including in the extrastriate cortex and the medial temporal lobe  ,  . In this light it should be noted that no further relationships were found between cortical activity outside the early visual cortex and reported visual attention regions discussed here and our measures of discrimination (which make stimulus-independent comparisons between exposure conditions). That said, measures of accuracy   within   an exposure condition did relate to activity in stimulus-dependent effect in MTL regions, a pattern not seen in any other cortical region (including those reported here, see  ). 


### Manipulating exposure schedule 
  
Thus far we have concentrated on examining discrimination improvement as a function of the amount of exposure, by comparing both discrimination performance and brain activity linked to exposed stimuli or to a non-exposed novel baseline. However, as was noted in the  , it is also well established that the schedule of exposure is important – in particular, intermixed exposure schedules, which afford the opportunity to compare the to-be-discriminated stimuli, support more improvement in discrimination than do blocked schedules (e.g.,  ,  ,  ). As the amount of stimulus exposure is equivalent in intermixed and blocked exposure, any observed differences in behaviour cannot be attributed to the frequency of exposure to the stimuli (i.e., simple familiarity). However, it remains an open question as to whether the psychological mechanisms responsible for schedule effects differ from those supporting effects based on the amount of exposure. Indeed, the idea that perceptual learning reflects an interaction between differential adaptation to the common and unique features of exposed stimuli and the formation of enduring representations applies equally well to both schedule effects and simple exposure (e.g.  ,  ,  ). 

Consider the fact that during intermixed exposure the interval between presentations of the unique features of two similar stimuli is greater than between those of the common features (which both stimuli share, and thus are seen on each presentation). This difference in the patterning of exposure to the unique and common elements might be a particularly effective means of adapting or habituating the common features of the two stimuli, leaving the unique elements to become better represented and available to be learnt about subsequently. In other words, the operation of short-term adaptation/habituation processes has enduring repercussions for the attentional weighting given to the unique and common features (see also  ). For blocked, the intervals between features are the same for both unique and common features, so the relative timing cannot contribute to the degree of adaptation, but it remains the case that the features that are common to all stimuli will be encountered more often than features that are unique to one or other stimulus. Thus there are still grounds for the unique features to gain relatively greater weighting in the representation of the stimulus as a whole. Of course, novel stimuli afford neither the opportunity for adaptation to differentially-weight the attention to common and unique features, nor the chance to form an integrated representation of the stimulus as a whole at all. Thus, as well as explaining the effects of exposure schedule, our adaptation-based account also applies to the amount of exposure. In this light it is particularly interesting that the same cortical regions are active when contrasting intermixed stimuli with novel stimuli and when contrasting intermixed and blocked stimuli (excepting V1 and V2). Thus, it seems that the improvement in discrimination based on the amount of exposure to a stimulus is, for the most part, underpinned by the same neural processes as the more specific effect of the schedule of exposure. Of course, the existence of a common brain substrate need not indicate that a single cognitive mechanism underlies perceptual learning, and the lack of V1/2 differential activity following intermixed versus blocked exposure (and the presence of this activity when contrasting intermixed with novel stimuli), points to some level of divergence in brain processing. That said, a common mechanism underpinning effects of schedule and amount of exposure is not incompatible with the current data. Consider our previous speculation that V1/2 are initially involved in local, featural discriminations, but can be superseded once more complex configural information becomes available (perhaps from V3/4 or from upstream feedback via stimulus-specific perceptual processing in extrastriate or medial temporal lobe regions  ,  ). If these very simple features are present in all stimuli, and they differ only in their amount or location, then only the overall amount of exposure (and not the relative intervals) will produce differential adaptation. 

In summary, there is a large degree of commonality between the brain regions recruited as a result of simple exposure, and those recruited by the difference in the schedule of that exposure. Taken alongside the fact that the behavioural effects of manipulating the amount and schedule of exposure are similar (they both produce an improvement in discrimination) suggests the nature of exposure primarily influences the degree rather than the quality or kind of learning. This is not to say that the amount of exposure is the sole determinant of perceptual learning (c.f.,  ) but rather that different schedules of exposure afford the involvement of the cognitive and brain mechanisms supporting perceptual learning to different degrees. 



## Summary and Conclusion 
  
The present study investigated the effects of stimulus exposure on the visual cortex and frontoparietal regions, both as a function of amount of exposure (intermixed vs novel), the schedule of exposure (intermixed vs blocked), and also of the type of stimulus (dots, faces, scenes). Experience-dependent changes in activity in early visual cortex was seen for all three types of visual stimuli, and was evident when both intermixed was contrasted with novel stimuli and when intermixed was contrasted with blocked exposure. Areas V1 and V2 were activated in participants showing limited exposure-dependent improvement in discrimination, but there was a decrease in this activity as the level of improvement increased. These relationships were only observed in response to the amount of exposure, but not the schedule of exposure. Relationships involving activity in other brain areas and the amount of improvement based upon exposure showed the same pattern though they were typically stronger for the intermixed/novel contrast than the intermixed/blocked contrast. Areas V3 and V4 were not activated in participants showing weak experience-dependent improvements in discrimination, but became progressively deactivated as the level of such improvement increased. Areas known to be involved in visual attention (e.g., IPS, FEF, SEF) were also shown to have a similar relationship with behavioural performance, supporting the suggestion (see  ,  ) that changes in attention contribute to perceptual learning. Moreover, the similarity between the neural signature of experience-dependent improvements in discrimination based on the amount and schedule of exposure suggests that the two manipulations have their effects through a shared mechanism.

# Abstract
 
Very preterm birth (VPT; < 33 weeks of gestation) is associated with an increased risk of learning disability, which contributes to more VPT-born children repeating grades and underachieving in school. Learning problems associated with VPT birth may be caused by pathophysiological alterations in neurodevelopment resulting from perinatal brain insult; however, adaptive neuroplastic processes may subsequently occur in the developing preterm brain which ameliorate, to an extent, the potential sequelae of altered neurophysiology. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare neuronal activation in 24 VPT individuals and 22 controls (CT) in young adulthood during a learning task consisting of the encoding and subsequent recognition of repeated visual paired associates. Structural MRI data were also collected and analysed in order to explore possible structure-function associations. Whilst the two groups did not differ in their learning ability, as demonstrated by their capacity to recognize previously-seen and previously–unseen visual pairs, between-group differences in linear patterns of Blood Oxygenation Level Dependant (BOLD) activity were observed across the four repeated blocks of the task for both the encoding and recognition conditions, suggesting that the way learning takes place differs between the two groups. During encoding, significant between-group differences in patterns of BOLD activity were seen in clusters centred on the cerebellum, the anterior cingulate gyrus, the midbrain/substantia nigra, medial temporal (including parahippocampal) gyrus and inferior and superior frontal gyri. During the recognition condition, significant between-group differences in patterns of BOLD activity were seen in clusters centred on the claustrum and the posterior cerebellum. Structural analysis revealed smaller grey matter volume in right middle temporal gyrus in VPT individuals compared to controls, however volume in this region was not significantly associated with functional activation. These results demonstrate that although cognitive task performance between VPT individuals and controls may be comparable on certain measures, differences in BOLD signal may also be evident, some of which could represent compensatory neural processes following VPT-related brain insult. 
   Highlights  
  
We investigated visual memory ability in young adults who were born very prematurely and a term-born control group 
  
Similar performance levels were observed between the groups on a task measuring visual memory capacity 
  
fMRI analysis revealed that there are significantly different processes occurring between the groups concerning the adaptation of neural resources during learning and recall 
  
Structural differences were also found, with very-prematurely born adults having smaller grey matter volume in a region relevant to visual processing 
  
In the preterm group, some of these different neural responses may represent the results of compensatory neuroplastic processes which aid in overcoming perinatal brain insult

## Introduction 
  
Very preterm birth (VPT; < 33 completed weeks of gestation) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive disability in childhood and adolescence. Studies have found modest but statistically significant deficits in areas including perceptual–motor skills ( ), language ability ( ;  ;  ), executive functions ( ;  ) verbal and visual memory ( ;  ;  ) and IQ ( ;  ). The cognitive deficits resulting from VPT birth are associated with later academic difficulties ( ;  ) and potentially have a role in the higher incidence of behavioural and psychiatric difficulties seen in these populations in childhood and adulthood ( ;  ). 

The extensive structural brain alterations seen in VPT populations, from infancy through to young adulthood, likely represent an underlying cause of cognitive impairment ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, recent research on the functional sequelae of VPT birth has led to the hypothesis that adaptive neuroplastic processes may allow some VPT born individuals to attain levels of cognitive functioning which are less deficient than might otherwise have been expected given these pathophysiological occurrences ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). 

Postulated compensatory neural pathways can be observed when VPT born individuals and controls complete the same behavioural tasks, whilst their brain activity is measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Studies investigating Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations during tasks involving language functions, for example, have identified altered patterns of neural interconnectivity between task-specific brain areas (i.e. frontal and temporal cortices) in individuals born VPT compared to controls. During a passive auditory language task, stronger connectivity was observed in VPT-born children between left Wernicke’s area and the right inferior frontal gyrus (the homologue of Broca’s area) and the supramarginal gyri bilaterally ( ); whereas during a semantic association task, VPT-born children demonstrated stronger connectivity between typical language processing and sensorimotor areas, whilst also showing weaker connectivity within areas of the prefrontal cortex ( ). 

Other studies have investigated brain structure and function simultaneously, to elucidate how damage to the former could effect the latter.   demonstrated functional differences between VPT born young adults and controls using a verbal paired associates learning task. During the task, pairs of word-stimuli were presented four times (encoding), intercalated with four blocks of cued-recall trials. Equivalent performance on the behavioural measures was seen, but between-group differences in patterns of BOLD activity were apparent in the right anterior cingulate-caudate body during encoding and in the thalamus and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus during recall. This study also reported reduced white matter integrity in the VPT group in tracts passing through the thalamic/hippocampal region that was differently activated during recall, suggesting that functional activation is partly accounted for by anatomical differences in regions displaying BOLD signal change. In another study, Gimenez and colleagues ( ), using a declarative ‘face-name’ memory task, demonstrated significantly greater right hippocampal activation in VPT adolescents than controls, which was associated with a significant decreased volume of the left hippocampus. The authors interpreted this as evidence of a compensatory mechanism in the VPT individuals. Interestingly, in this study, despite the proposed neural compensation, behavioural performance in the VPT group was still poorer than the control group, indicating that such plasticity may not always be fully effective. 

Of relevance to this study is a report by Narberhaus et al. ( ), which used the same visuo-perceptual learning task we investigated and described the mean BOLD signal response during four encoding and four recognition blocks of visual stimuli-pairs in VPT-born adults compared to controls. They reported that, despite no significant performance differences between the groups, during encoding VPT subjects showed increased activation compared to controls in the left caudate nucleus, right cuneus and left superior parietal lobule and a mean decreased signal in the right inferior frontal gyrus. During recognition, VPT individuals showed a mean increased BOLD signal response compared to controls in the right cerebellum and in the anterior cingulate gyrus bilaterally. The authors argued that these differential activation patterns represented neural compensation following perinatal brain injury subsequent to very preterm birth. However, as noted by the authors, an important methodological limitation with their analysis concerned the averaging of activations across the four repeated blocks of the task. This had the potential to mask more ‘pure’ memory effects with repetition effects and retrieval with encoding effects. 

Therefore, in this study, we extended the work of Narberhaus et al. ( ) by reanalysing their data to study the adaptation of neural resources during the learning and recall processes. We aimed to investigate whether the way learning of visual paired associates takes place differs between very preterm-born adults and control participants. In order to explore this we determined brain regions, in a sample of VPT young adults and separately in a control group, that demonstrated either increasing or decreasing linear activation patterns over the four repeated blocks of the encoding and recognition phases. We then looked for any patterns of functional adaptation that differed significantly between the groups. 

In normative samples, paired associates learning tasks typically activate a fronto-parieto-occipital network ( ), as well as a hippocampal-diencephalic circuitry and medial temporal lobe structures ( ;  ;  ). 

Specifically, decreased activation in thalamus and superior frontal gyrus has been associated with repeated stimuli presentations in humans ( ). A possible explanation could be that activation during the first learning blocks reflect a direct access to the associations learnt during encoding which exploit areas of the thalamus projecting to the prefrontal cortex ( ) and hippocampus ( ). With practice and successful retrieval of the paired associates, subsequent retrieval may become more automatic and thus may not require access to regions centrally involved in encoding. 

We hypothesized that VPT born young adults would display altered linear patterns of BOLD signal response compared to controls during the processes of encoding and recognition in components of the fronto-parieto-occipital, hippocampal-thalamic and temporal lobe networks, which include areas found to be particularly impacted in VPT cohorts, both at a functional ( ;  ;  ;  ) and a structural level ( ;  ;  ;  ). We further conducted exploratory analyses to investigate whether structural alterations (using a whole-brain analysis approach) in the VPT group would be significantly associated with functional activation ( ;  ). 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
In 1983–84, 147 infants born at less than 33 weeks gestation and admitted consecutively to the Neonatal Unit at University College London Hospital (UCLH) within 5 days of birth, survived, were discharged, and were enrolled for long-term follow up. Of this cohort, 78 individuals were born at 28 or less weeks of gestation and 69 were born between 29 and 33 weeks of gestation. At age 15 years, 113 (76.9%) of these individuals received a cognitive, behavioural and neurological assessment and 90 (61.2%) had an MRI. At age 20, 94 (83.2%) of the individuals assessed in adolescence agreed to participate in follow-up ( ). For the current fMRI study, 24 young adults of both sexes who were born VPT with no history of cerebral palsy, grade 3/4 intraventricular haemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia as assessed by neonatal cranial ultrasound, were randomly selected from the cohort described above. These are the same subjects who participated in the study by  , with the addition of three VPT individuals who were previously not analysed due to image corruption issues which were successfully fixed prior to this analysis).Twenty-two controls (CT) were recruited from advertisements in the local press and university and were selected according to age, handedness and gender. Inclusion criteria were full-term birth (37–42 completed weeks of gestation); exclusion criteria were birth complications (e.g. low birth weight defined as < 2500 g, endotracheal mechanical ventilation), prolonged gestation (greater than 42 weeks), history of psychiatric illness, severe hearing deficits and motor impairment. All participants were English native speakers and right handed. The experiments were undertaken with the understanding and written consent of each subject, with the approval of the appropriate local ethics committee, and in compliance with national legislation and the Code of Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). 


### Functional MRI task: Visual paired associates 
  
The task used here is identical to that used by   and contained the following conditions: encoding, recognition, same/different discrimination and low-level baseline, presented in that order (see  ). During the encoding condition, participants were presented with pairs of coloured abstract pictures on black squares and were required to indicate via a button response (‘Yes’/‘No’) if the two pictures were associated. Subjects were posed this question in order that they might think about ways in which the two images were linked, which would require close comparison and thus support encoding of the pairs. The same visual pairs were presented in the encoding condition four times but within each block the order of the picture pairs was randomized. In the recognition condition, one picture from each of the pairs presented during encoding was presented either paired with the same (50% of trials) or with a novel picture (50% of trials). Participants were required to indicate if they had seen those pairs of pictures before (‘Yes’/‘No’). Participants were instructed not to press any button if they did not know what to answer. To reduce the possible confounding effects of differential task performance between the groups on blood oxygen level–dependent signal, in each recognition block of 8 responses each, only activation related to correct responses was modelled. 

In the same/different baseline condition, participants viewed pairs of novel pictures which were clearly identical or dissimilar and were required to indicate whether the pictures were the same (‘Yes’/‘No’). There was also a low-level baseline condition during which participants were shown two black rectangles, with no pictures inside, of the same dimension as those containing pictures in the preceding conditions and were instructed to press one of the buttons at random. This condition was subtracted from all subsequent analyses. 

Participants were familiarized with the task during an offline training session with two repetitions of the four conditions, each containing 4 stimulus pairs using different pictures to those subsequently presented during the experimental “on-line” session. All stimuli were shown in central vision. Responses during each condition were recorded online. There was no rest (fixation) period between the blocks, but an ‘instruction’ question preceded each encoding (“Are these pictures associated?”), recognition (“Have you seen this pair of pictures before?”), same/different baseline (“Do these pictures look the same?”) and low-level baseline block (“Look at the squares”). Each condition was presented in blocks lasting 40 s, with 8 presentations of stimulus pairs per block. There were 4 repetitions of each block in the same order (encoding, recognition, same/different baseline, low-level baseline). 


### MRI data acquisition 
  
Image acquisition was performed using a 1.5 T GE Sigma Neurovascular MR system (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA). A quadrature head coil was used for RF transmission and reception. An inversion recovery EPI data set with 3 mm thick near-axial slices (inter-slice gap .3 mm) and an in-plane resolution of 1.5 mm (TR 3000 ms, TE 40 ms, flip angle 90°) was acquired to facilitate mapping of the functional data into Talairach space. One hundred and forty eight T2*-weighted images were acquired at each of 16 near-axial 7 mm thick planes (inter-slice gap .7 mm) parallel to the intercommissural (AC–PC) plane so as to include the whole brain (FOV 24 × 24 cm and matrix 64 ), the first four (dummy) volumes being discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects. The interstimulus interval (ISI) was 5 s. This length was chosen to allow for the longer reaction time latencies of very preterm-born individuals and to provide them with a slightly longer than usual interval of rest between trials ( ). The period between the acquisition of clustered image volumes was set at 3.5 s and the image volume acquisition at 1.5 s (TE 40 ms, ﬂip angle 90°). Three-dimensional T -weighted gradient-echo sequences were also collected in order to allow reconstruction in any plane of 124 1.5 mm slices (TR 35 ms, TE 5 ms, flip angle 35°) to enable the measurement of structural MRI data. 


### Functional MRI analysis 
  
#### Individual and group mapping 
  
The analysis was hypothesis-driven, and modelled patterns of increase or decrease of activation across the four blocks during encoding, and separately, during recognition. The fMRI data were analysed with the XBAM software (version 4) developed at the Institute of Psychiatry ( ) using a non-parametric permutation-based strategy to minimize assumptions. The non-parametric approach is important to achieve rigorous statistical inference given the difficulty of establishing normality in fMRI data ( ;  ). The images were first corrected for subject motion ( ) and then smoothed using a Gaussian filter (FWHM 8.8 mm) chosen to improve signal-to-noise ratio over the spatial neighbourhood of each voxel. 

Responses to the experimental paradigm were then detected by fitting a linear model in which each component of the design was convolved separately with two gamma variety functions (peak responses at 4 and 8 s) to allow for variability in the haemodynamic delay. A goodness of fit statistic was computed, consisting of the ratio of the sum of squares of deviations from the mean image intensity due to the model (over the whole time series) to the sum of squares of deviations due to the residuals (SSQ). This addresses the problem inherent in the use of the F statistic that the residual degrees of freedom are often unknown in fMRI time series due to the presence of coloured noise in the signal. The data were permuted by the wavelet-based method described and extensively characterized in Bullmore et al. ( ), which permits the data-driven calculation of the null distribution of SSQ under the assumption of no experimentally-determined response. This distribution can then be used to threshold the activation maps at any desired type I error rate. In addition to the SSQ, the percentage BOLD change was also calculated from the model fit at each voxel. In order to increase sensitivity and reduce the multiple comparison problem, the analysis was extended from voxel to cluster level using a method described in detail in   which has been shown to give excellent cluster-wise type I error control. The observed and randomized SSQ data for each individual were normalized into the standard space ( ) and group maps of activated regions were computed using the group median as described in Brammer et al. ( ). Permutation strategies and median statistics were employed to allow exact computation of   p  -values with minimal assumptions and the minimization of outlier effects. The final cluster maps were thresholded in such a way as to obtain < 0.9 false positive 3D clusters per map. 


#### Group differences 
  
The between-group analysis aimed to find significant interactions between group and linear trend of activation. Comparisons of responses between groups were performed by fitting the data at each intracerebral voxel at which all subjects have non-zero data by linear modelling of the contrast of interest. The model is fitted by minimizing the sum of absolute deviations rather than the sums of squares to reduce outlier effects. The null distribution is computed by permuting data between groups (assuming the null hypothesis of no effect of group membership) and refitting the model at each voxel. Group difference maps at any desired voxel or cluster-wise type I error rate can then be computed by appropriate thresholding of this null distribution. The statistical thresholds were adjusted in such a way as to obtain < 0.9 false positive activated 3D clusters per map. 



### Structural MRI data processing and analysis 
  
Structural MRI data sets were analysed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in Statistical Parametric Mapping SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, Institute of Neurology, London, UK,  /), running on Matlab 7.8 (Math-Works, Natick, USA). The T1-weighted images were affined-registered to an SPM T1 template and segmented into grey and white matter. Then, the affined-registered grey matter images were normalized to a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate space using the unified DARTEL algorithm ( ) with modulation for non-linear components, which compares the absolute amount of tissue corrected for individual brain sizes. All grey matter images were smoothed with a 12 mm Gaussian kernel and used for statistical analyses. A whole brain statistical comparison evaluating regional grey matter differences between very preterm born individuals and controls was performed at the statistical threshold of   p   < .05, after family-wise-error (FWE) correction. Grey matter eigenvalues for each study participant were calculated for any clusters where significant between-group differences were noted; SPM’s ‘volume of interest’ (VOI) data extraction tool was employed. The coordinates locating clusters which significantly differed between the two groups were originally reported in MNI space. The ones we are reporting here were converted to Talairach space using the Non-linear Yale MNI to Talairach Conversion Algorithm ( ) ( ). 

#### Structure-function associations 
  
In order to explore structure-function associations, we looked for significant correlations (Bonferroni corrected,   p   < 0.005) between the structural eigenvalues extracted from areas that significantly differed between the groups and functional SSQ ratios extracted from the regions demonstrating significant linear BOLD response interaction effects. To characterize the change seen across the four blocks of each encoding and recognition interaction, we created a measure of ‘mean slope change’ for the VPT and CT groups separately using the following formula: 





### Analysis of Neonatal, socio-demographic and behavioural data 
  
These data were explored with independent samples   t  -tests or their appropriate non-parametric equivalent. Online task performance was assessed with a mixed-design ANOVA. 



## Results 
  
### Neonatal, socio-demographic and behavioural data 
  
 displays neonatal, socio-demographic, and behavioural data for study participants. The VPT group and controls did not differ statistically in terms of gender distribution (χ  = 2.1 ,   p   > 0.05), age at assessment (  U   = 238.00, N  = 22, N  = 24,   p   > 0.05, two-tailed), nor in ratings of parental social economic class (χ (42) = 5.57,   p   > 0.05). No significant between-group differences were observed in full-scale IQ (  U   = 137.00, N  = 11, N  = 24,   p   > 0.05, two-tailed), verbal IQ (  U   = 134.00, N  = 11, N  = 24,   p   > 0.05, two-tailed) or performance IQ (  U   = 146.00, N  = 11, N  = 24,   p   > 0.05, two-tailed) as assessed by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) ( ). 

In terms of correct response rates for the online behavioural task, a mixed-design ANOVA demonstrated no main effect of group (  F  (44) = 0.10,   p   > 0.05) but a significant main effect of block (  F  (44) = 4.76,   p   = 0.003) with no significant group × block interaction (  F  (44) = 0.74,   p   > 0.05). Post-hoc analyses revealed that the mean correct response rates to block 2 (5.76, S.D. = 1.57) were higher than to block 1 (4.93, S.D. = 1.40;   t   = 3.37, df = 45,   p   = 0.002) and to block 4 (5.72, S.D. = 1.75) higher than to block 1 (  t   = 3.40, df = 45,   p   = 0.001). These results demonstrate a learning effect, equal across groups, from having the stimulus pairs repeated 4 times. 


### Functional MRI results 
  
#### Within group fMRI results 
  
For the controls, during encoding, a linear increase in neural activation over the four blocks was seen in a cluster with peak activation in the right brainstem with decreasing activation seen in the left posterior cerebellum and right middle temporal gyrus. During recognition, increasing activation was seen in the left precuneus and left anterior cerebellum with decreasing activation in the left fusiform gyrus (see  ). 

For the VPT-born individuals, during encoding, a linear increase in neural activation over the four blocks was seen in a cluster with peak activation in the left anterior cerebellum with decreasing activation seen in the right thalamus. During recognition, increasing activation was seen in the left anterior cerebellum with decreasing activation in the right posterior cerebellum, left superior frontal gyrus, left precuneus, left posterior cingulate and right anterior cingulate (see  ). 


#### Between group fMRI results 
  
A statistically significant interaction between group and patterns of change of activation during encoding was found in eight regions. In four of these, the control participants showed an overall increasing pattern of activation in comparison to the VPT participants who showed a decreasing pattern. These clusters had a peak voxel of local maxima in the left midbrain/substantia nigra, the right parahippocampal gyrus, the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right anterior cingulate. A reverse pattern of activation was seen in the remaining four areas, with the VPT participants showing an overall increasing pattern of activation in comparison to a decreasing pattern in the control group. These clusters had a peak voxel of local maxima in the left posterior cerebellum, the right anterior cerebellum, the right middle temporal gyrus and the right superior frontal gyrus (see   and  ). 

A statistically significant interaction between group and patterns of change of activation during recognition was found in just two regions. In one of these, that had a peak voxel of local maxima in the right claustrum, the CT participants showed an overall increasing pattern of activation in comparison to the VPT participants who showed an overall decreasing pattern. A reverse pattern of activation was seen in a cluster with a peak voxel of local maxima in the left posterior cerebellum, with the VPT participants showing an overall increasing pattern of activation in comparison to the CT participants who showed a decreasing pattern (see   and  ). 



### Structural analysis results 
  
Structural analysis revealed smaller grey matter volume in the right middle temporal gyrus (rMTG) in the VPT group compared to CT participants (  x   = 45,   y   = −17,   z   = –30;   p   < 0.001). 

#### Structure-function associations 
  
When eigenvalues extracted from the significant cluster centred in right middle temporal gyrus were correlated with SSQs extracted from the 10 regions where significant linear interactions were found (encoding and recognition), no significant associations were found, after Bonferroni corrections, for the VPT nor CT groups. 




## Discussion 
  
Very preterm birth has been associated with long-lasting cognitive deficits, which can have profound effects on academic and career achievement, and are likely to be mediated by structural and functional brain alterations following perinatal brain injury. A recent hypothesis predicts that adaptive neuroplasticity in the developing brain may ameliorate the severity of these deficits in some cases via the utilization of compensatory neural pathways ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). One study, by  , using an fMRI based visual paired associates task, concluded that the differential patterns of neural activation seen in the VPT group, including decreased BOLD response in inferior frontal gyrus accompanied by increased response in caudate nucleus, cuneus and superior parietal lobule, likely represented compensatory neural processes for the adult consequences of perinatal brain injury. However, a methodological limitation of that study concerned the averaging of activations across the four repeated blocks of the experiment, which masked the underlying neurobiology taking place during learning and recall. By expanding the cohort and reanalysing the data via a linear analysis of the BOLD response over the four repeated blocks of the encoding and recognition phases, we could, for the first time, investigate patterns of functional adaptation in relation to visual learning strategies in VPT-born individuals and controls in young adulthood. The results we found with this improved methodology were substantially different from those of  ; our analysis highlighted a number of memory and other domain-general cognitive and attentional regions differentially activated between the CT and VPT groups that were not shown in that study. This suggests that a linear analysis approach is more sensitive for detecting functional alterations during a repeated-block learning paradigm than is the method of using mean activation. 

The VPT and control groups demonstrated a similar improvement in mean accuracy scores across the four recognition blocks of the online behavioural task. This demonstrated that a learning effect took place. The fMRI results demonstrated that it is the way in which this learning effect takes place that is different between the groups. The first piece of evidence for this is seen in the results from the within group analyses ( ). This revealed that both groups demonstrated patterns of BOLD signal change across the four blocks of the task in domain-general cognitive and attentional regions typically activated during tasks involving learning ( ;  ). However, both groups also showed activation in areas previously demonstrated to be specifically involved in memory processing and, crucially, these were largely different between the groups. For example, during encoding, controls demonstrated increasing activation in the right middle frontal gyrus, which has been associated with visual working memory ( ;  ) whereas the VPT group had increasing activation in the left parahippocampal gyrus, which has been associated specifically with non-verbal memory processing ( ). It is this differential activation in memory-related regions, seen here and explored further in the between-subjects analysis, which is suggestive of neuroplastic adaptation in the VPT group. 

For the between-subjects analysis, we were specifically interested in the interaction between group and block. That is to say, we wanted to investigate whether there were any brain regions that would show significantly different patterns of linear BOLD signal change between groups across the four encoding and, separately, across the four recognition blocks. Eight regions ( ) demonstrated such an interaction during the encoding blocks; in four of these there was a pattern of overall progressively increasing activation in the CT participants and decreasing activation in the VPT participants and, in four, the reverse pattern occurred. There were two regions that demonstrated a significant interaction during the recognition blocks; in one of these, activation increased in the CT group and decreased in the VPT group, whilst in the other, the reverse pattern occurred. From these 10 regions, several stand out in relation to our hypothesis of neural adaptation during visual learning in the VPT brain. During the encoding phase, the VPT group had decreasing activation compared to the CT group’s increasing activation in a cluster centred on the right parahippocampal gyrus extending to the hippocampus, key memory-related areas ( ), as well as in the thalamus which has reciprocal connections to the hippocampus and is central to episodic memory processing ( ) and which together represent components of a fronto-subcortical network involved in associative learning ( ). However, the VPT group showed increasing activation compared to the CT group’s decreasing activation in the right superior frontal gyrus, a region known to be involved in various memory functions including episodic and working memory ( ;  ;  ) which typically decreases in activation with repeated stimuli presentations ( ). 

In terms of the structural findings, in a whole brain analysis we found the VPT group to have reduced volume, compared to controls, in a cluster that included most of the right middle temporal gyrus. This result is consistent with the findings of a structural study from our group in a larger sample of VPT participants in mid-adolescence, which included the current study subjects ( ), and reported decreased volume in middle temporal gyri bilaterally. However, despite findings in previous studies which observed significant associations between regional volume alterations and BOLD signal change in similar samples of VPT born individuals completing paired associate learning tasks ( ;  ), in the current investigation, after correcting for multiple comparisons, no significant associations between the volume of the right middle temporal gyrus and fMRI results were observed. This lack of association is difficult to account for. However, it may be that despite our best efforts to create a metric which represented the change in BOLD response across the four time points (see  .), inter-subject variation, in relation to precisely when a structural reduction effects BOLD response, could render correlation between a static time-point (i.e. the eigenvalues representing rMTG volume) and a time-series, ineffective. 

In relation to our principal hypothesis of neural adaptation during visual learning in the VPT brain, we therefore propose that the increased BOLD response of the VPT subjects, in comparison to the controls, in the right superior frontal gyrus, represents compensatory neural adaptation in response to reduced activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus and thalamus. Furthermore, that the increasing BOLD response in the VPT group, compared to controls, in the right middle temporal gyrus, an area which has been associated with visual semantic processing ( ), may represent an attempt at compensatory activity in this structurally altered area. 

It is likely that much of the differential activation we observed was not related to compensatory neural processes but reflects altered neural responses which, were the subjects to undertake a more challenging task, could potentially result in behavioural differences. Closer inspection of our results supports this. Firstly, the between-subjects analysis revealed three clusters (two during encoding and one during recall) where activation in the cerebellum increased for the VPT subjects but decreased for the controls. Emerging evidence places the cerebellum within a network of regions demonstrating reduced activity with practice during task domain-general activity ( ), possibly due to neuronal adaptation to the repeated stimuli ( ;  ). The patterns of decreasing cerebellar activation observed in our control group support this theory, whereas the progressively increasing activation in our VPT group suggests that they may have experienced greater difficulty in completing the task. 

A second example of altered neural response in the VPT group can be seen in the activation of cingulate cortex ( ; encoding region 4, recognition region 1). The anterior cingulate receives input from midbrain dopaminergic neurons ( ) which are crucial for motivational salience ( ). Although Narberhaus et al. ( ) showed that in terms of mean activation across the blocks, VPT individuals activate the anterior cingulate and surrounding areas more than controls, our linear analysis revealed that, over time, the control participants increase their activation in this area, whilst in VPT participants it decreases. This possibly reflects a reduction in motivation as the task progresses. A reduction in task interest, albeit at a neural and not behavioural level, would also explain the decreasing activation of the substantia nigra in the VPT participants, as this region is also important in maintaining stimulus engagement ( ). As stressed previously however, if the examples cited above (cerebellum, anterior cingulate, substantia nigra) do reflect altered, or perhaps ‘sub-optimal’ neural responses in the VPT group, these would likely only become relevant in a task with higher cognitive demands. 

There are two other points from our analysis which merit further consideration. Firstly, most of the between-group differences occurred during the encoding and not the recognition phases of the task. This could suggest that the learning of visual-paired associations represents a more neuroanatomically vulnerable process to VPT-related brain insult than recognition. Secondly, if these results do indeed reflect compensatory neurodevelopment, this has occurred even in the absence of serious perinatal brain injury, for which this cohort of VPT individuals screened negative. 

There are several limitations to the current study. Firstly, we used a relatively small cohort, which restricts the generalizability of our conclusions. Secondly, the lack of more comprehensive offline visuo-spatial memory assessments in this sample leaves us with the probability that more challenging tasks would highlight behavioural deficits in the preterm cohort which would alter the interpretation of the putative adaptive differences from being fully- to only partially-effective. Thirdly, whilst other research has reported differing patterns of neuronal activation between VPT groups and full-term controls whilst performing paired-associates learning tasks, and used the results to support the hypothesis of compensatory neural adaptation ( ;  ;  ;  ), it is difficult to draw meaningful comparisons between our findings and those of the other studies, due to the differing nature of the behavioural tasks and analysis methods used. Specifically, our study is the first to use a linear analysis approach to investigate functional differences occurring during a visual paired associate task. 


## Conclusions 
  
In conclusion, the above results demonstrate that equivalent behavioural performance between VPT subjects and full-term controls can be underlined by significantly different neural processes. An emerging theory in preterm research is that brain insult in the perinatal period can lead to compensatory neurodevelopmental processes resulting in cognitive functioning being less deficient than might otherwise have been expected ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Whilst the results from this analysis support that theory, other altered neural processes are still evident which could have consequences where behavioural performance requirements are more demanding.

# Abstract
 
The detection and processing of novel information encountered as we explore our environment is crucial for learning and adaptive behavior. The human hippocampus has been strongly implicated in laboratory tests of novelty detection and episodic memory, but has been less well studied during more ethological tasks such as spatial navigation, typically used in animals. We examined fMRI BOLD activity as a function of environmental and object novelty as humans performed an object-location virtual navigation task. We found greater BOLD response to novel relative to familiar environments in the hippocampus and adjacent parahippocampal gyrus. Object novelty was associated with increased activity in the posterior parahippocampal/fusiform gyrus and anterior hippocampus extending into the amygdala and superior temporal sulcus. Importantly, whilst mid-posterior hippocampus was more sensitive to environmental novelty than object novelty, the anterior hippocampus responded similarly to both forms of novelty. Amygdala activity showed an increase for novel objects that decreased linearly over the learning phase. By investigating how participants learn and use different forms of information during spatial navigation, we found that medial temporal lobe (MTL) activity reflects both the novelty of the environment and of the objects located within it. This novelty processing is likely supported by distinct, but partially overlapping, sets of regions within the MTL.

## INTRODUCTION 
  
When exploring our environment, we must react to changes in our overall surroundings, but also simultaneously detect the novel content located within our environment. How the brain processes these different forms of novelty is not fully understood. A prime candidate for a role in novelty detection is the hippocampus ( ;  ;  , ; Kumaran and  ; for reviews see  ;  ;  ), an area normally associated with human mnemonic function (e.g., Scoville and  ; see Eichenbaum and  ;   for review). However, it is unclear from human and rodent models of the hippocampal system whether the hippocampus preferentially encodes novel content or contexts. Some studies in humans have found that the hippocampus responds to individual novel stimuli (e.g.,  ;  ,b;  ), while others have reported novel pictures/contexts/object pairings eliciting hippocampal activation ( ;  ;  ). 

Human intracranial EEG and fMRI data and studies in animal models have also implicated other medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions with mixed results. The perirhinal cortex was found to respond to novel objects and also stimuli pairings in humans ( ,  ) and novel object identification in nonhuman primates and rodents ( ; for review see Brown and  ). Previous studies have found pre-rhinal/parahippocampal cortex responses to novel contexts across species ( ;  ;  ), but one study did find parahippocampal cortex responses to object novelty ( ) that could be related to its hypothesized role in retrieving individual representations of a context (see   for review). Although the amygdala is most commonly activated in fMRI paradigms using affective and reward-related stimuli ( ;  ;  ), studies have also implicated the amygdala in detection of novel objects both in humans ( ;  ;  ) and rodents ( ;  ;  ). Consequently, it is unclear how different MTL structures might process novel objects and environments during a naturalistic spatial learning task. 

We examined the effects of environmental and object novelty on fMRI activity during a virtual spatial memory paradigm, similar to tasks used with rodents (see also  ,  ;  ), see  . Participants used a button box to navigate a first person perspective within virtual environments. Within each session, they learned the locations of six objects encountered within the environment, over four trials per object. In the replacement phase of the experiment, they were then cued by a picture of an object, replaced in the environment and had to navigate to the object's location, for one trial per object. Each session in a novel environment was followed by a session in the same (now familiar) environment. Three of the objects encountered in a session were new to that session and three had been encountered before in a different environment (see  ). 
  
Experimental Structure. A: Experimental environments shown from the participants' (first-person) perspective. Four different environments are presented in eight experimental sessions. The first two sessions (always the desert environments) provided practice outside of the scanner. Sessions 3–8 contained three novel-familiar environment repetitions with environment order, counterbalanced across participants. B: Learning phase trial structure. During learning trials, participants use a button box to navigate and “collect” three novel and three familiar (previously presented) objects (vase shown as example) four times each (a total of 24 trials per session). C: The object replacement phase, trial structure. After being cued for 3 s with a picture of an object that had been collected in the learning phase of the current session, participants were placed back in the environment and had to navigate to where they thought the object (object replacement) had been located during that learning period.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS 
  
### Participants 
  
Twenty male participants (mean age years = 23.9; SD = 3.7 years; range = 18–33) gave written consent and were compensated for performing the experimental task, as approved by the local Research Ethics Committee at University College London. All participants were right-handed with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and reported to be in good health with no prior history of neurological disease. Two participants were excluded from the fMRI analyses because of scanner malfunction. 


### Stimuli, Task, and Trial Structure 
  
As in  , the experiment was composed of eight sessions. The first two sessions were practice sessions in the same virtual desert environment, conducted on a laptop outside the MRI scanner. The participants familiarized themselves with the environment by navigating around and then collecting objects in the environment by running into them and then being tested on their previous location. These practice sessions lasted for ∼2–3 min. 

During the fMRI sessions, an individual trial consisted of a participant being randomly placed in an environment and having to navigate towards an object to collect it and to remember its location (mean duration 9.04 s per trial; SD = 3.12s). Participants had four trials to learn the location for each of the six objects interleaved in a set of 24 trials. Next participants were presented with a gray screen with a crosshair for 4 s between trials. After the learning phase was completed, there was a 30 s inter-phase rest period, when instructions on the next phase (object replacement phase) were presented. The object replacement phase for the location of each of the six collected objects started with a 3 s period in which an object was presented on a gray background (cue phase). Participants were then placed at a random location in the environment and told to navigate to the spot where they believed the pictured object had been located (mean duration = 12.41 s; SD = 4.14 s). They then pressed a button to indicate its previous location. Once the button was pressed, the ITI period would begin again for 4 s. 


### Procedure and Design 
  
Participants were instructed that they were going to navigate through a virtual environment over multiple sessions using a button box, and that they would have to pick up several different objects (six) in the environment, four times each (three objects, three times each for the two practice sessions). The order of trials was randomized (but unknown to participants) separated into three miniblocks. Object location never changed within a session. After they completed this learning phase, they were tested in an object replacement period, described above. 

During the fMRI portion of the experiment, a new environment was presented and then represented at the next session as a familiar environment. This occurred on four occasions (three in the fMRI component), so that half of the eight environments were novel (refer to  A). Each environment arena had the same area, but had its own unique shape (square, circle, triangle, and rectangle) and texture (desert, grass, snow, and rocky textures; refer to  ) to differentiate the environments. 

Participants were presented with counterbalanced familiar or novel objects within each environment. Following the practice sessions, the objects presented in an environment were comprised of objects that the participants had either collected (“familiar”) or not collected (“novel”) in a previous session. Familiar objects were always from different environments in the fMRI experiment and the first familiar objects were introduced during the practice session outside of the scanner. 


### fMRI Acquisition 
  
Functional images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Trio scanner. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) T2*-weighted functional images were acquired using a gradient-echo EPI pulse sequence acquired obliquely at 45° with the following parameters: repetition time, 3,360 ms; echo time, 30 ms; slice thickness, 2 mm; interslice gap, 1 mm; in-plane resolution, 3 × 3 mm; field of view, 64 × 72 mm ; 48 slices per volume. A field-map using a double echo FLASH sequence was recorded for distortion correction of the acquired EPI ( ). After the functional scans, a T1-weighted 3-D MDEFT structural image (1 mm ) was acquired to co-register and display the functional data. 


### fMRI Data Analysis 
  
Functional images were processed and analyzed using SPM8 ( ). The first five volumes were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration. Standard preprocessing included correction for differences in slice acquisition timing, realignment/unwarping to correct for interscan movement, and normalization of the images to an EPI template (specific to our sequence and scanner) that was aligned to the T1 MNI template. Finally, the normalized functional images were spatially smoothed with an isotropic 8 mm full-width half maximum Gaussian kernel. For all models, all regressors, with the exception of the movement parameters, were convolved with the SPM hemodynamic response function. Data were also high-pass filtered (cut-off period = 128 s). 

Statistical analyses were performed using a general linear model within SPM8 with a block design for navigation periods during the learning phase, where we compared those navigation trial blocks to the blocks of adjacent intertrial intervals (ITI) to remove effects of slow variations in BOLD signal. Each fMRI session was modeled with seven regressors of interest, (1) navigation to novel objects during learning, (2) navigation to familiar objects during learning, (3) navigation with novel object cues during object replacement, (4) navigation with familiar object cues during object replacement, (5) novel object cue periods, and (6) familiar object cue periods, and (7) the ITI. Each trial was modeled as a boxcar function lasting the length of the navigation period (i.e., the length of time the participant took to “pick up” or “drop” the object for that specific trial). Although we explicitly modelled the cue periods, they were not used in our subsequent analyses, because of the low number and brief duration of trials. Each session included a further six “movement”' regressors estimated during realignment. 

Six sessions were modeled, three relating to novel environments and three to familiar environments. This resulted in eight main conditions of interest (at both learning and object replacement; although objects were cued beforehand and not visible within an environment during object replacement): novel objects in a novel environment during the learning phase, familiar (previously seen) objects in a novel environment during the learning phase, novel objects in a familiar environment during the learning phase, familiar objects in a familiar environment during the learning phase, novel objects in a novel environment during the replacement phase, familiar objects in a novel environment during the replacement phase, novel objects in a familiar environment during the replacement phase, familiar objects in a familiar environment during the replacement phase. Each condition was contrasted with the session specific ITI prior to second-level analyses. From these conditions of interest, we ran an omnibus test to look at novelty effects during learning and replacement phases, which equated to a 2 × 2 × 2 (Experimental Phase × Environmental Novelty × Object Novelty) factorial design. 

A further analysis split the learning phase into four quartiles (for each of the four object presentations, i.e., first–fourth presentations during the learning phase), to assess changes in novelty across encoding trials, resulting in 16 regressors (plus movement parameters). The six objects were repeatedly presented across four mini-blocks (first–fourth presentations), so that object presentation quartiles also coincided with the first quartile-fourth quartile of trials in a novel or familiar environment. Using a one-way ANOVA for first–fourth quartiles for each condition of interest, we investigated significant linear decreases over time for both novel versus familiar environments and objects. 

Data were high-pass filtered (cut-off period = 128 s). Based on strong a priori hypotheses related to MTL involvement in novelty processing and use of a similar fMRI paradigm ( , ;  ), we report activations surviving an uncorrected statistical threshold of   P =   0.001 and cluster threshold   k   = 5 for the whole brain. Since we are using an uncorrected statistical threshold, we also report whether the peak voxel of MTL activations survive small-volume correction (SVC) for multiple comparisons (FWE p<.05) using a bilateral MTL mask encompassing the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus constructed in the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) toolbox for SPM ( ). Coordinates of brain regions are reported in MNI space. Post-hoc statistical analyses were conducted using 10 mm radius spheres in MarsBar ( ) toolbox within SPM8 around the respective peak voxel specified in the corresponding results section to compare activity in one region across different conditions (e.g., to determine whether an object novelty effect was present in a region defined by the main effect of environmental novelty, or vice versa). 



## RESULTS 
  
### Behavioral Results 
  
To assess behavioral performance, we looked at the distance error between where participants had indicated an object was during the object replacement phase and where it was actually located in the environment. Behavior was generally in line with past studies using this paradigm ( ). The average length of navigation trials was 9.04 s (SD = 3.12 s) during the learning phase and 12.41 s (SD = 4.14 s) during the test phase. There were converse effects of environmental and object novelty on navigation time during the learning phase with more time spent navigating in novel versus familiar environments (  P   = 0.024; F(1,19) = 5.993) and less time spent navigating toward novel versus familiar objects (  P   = 0.01;F(1,19) = 8.272). However, there was no significant interaction between effects of object and environmental novelty on navigation times (  P   = 0.598; F(1,19) = 0.288). During the object replacement phase there were no significant differences in navigation trial times between novel versus familiar environments (  P   = 0.670; F(1,19) = 0.187), novel versus familiar objects (  P   = 0.395; F(1,19) = 0.758), or any interaction between effects of object and environmental novelty (  P   = 0.552; F(1,19) = 0.367). See Table  for group means. 
  
Behavioral Data by Condition 
  
There were no significant performance differences between memory (i.e., 1/distance error) for novel versus familiar object locations (  P   = 0.268; F(1,19) = 1.31), or object locations in novel versus familiar environments (  P   = 0.281; F(1,19) = 1.23; see Table  for group means). In line with our effect showing significant longer exploration durations for familiar versus novel objects, there was significantly enhanced performance for learning the location of novel versus familiar objects in novel environments (  P   = 0.049,   t  (19) = 2.11; see Table  for group means). These findings are similar to previous behavioral findings showing proactive interference, where participants have impaired performance and need to spend more time learning object locations of “familiar” objects that were associated with a location in a previous environment ( ). Over the course of the experiment, participants displayed a significant linear trend towards spending less time navigating during learning (  P   = 0.024; F(1,19) = 6.00) and test (  P   = 0.017; F(1,19) = 6.86) trials in later experimental sessions (see Table  for group means). Participants also performed better in later sessions, exhibiting a marginal linear trend toward improved performance (increased 1/distance error) over sessions (  P   = 0.089; F(1,19) = 3.191; see Table  for group means).

### fMRI Results 
  
#### Environmental novelty 
  
We used a 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA (Object × Environment × Phase) to test whether there were significant differences for object and environmental novelty processing during learning and object replacement phases. When contrasting navigation in novel versus familiar environments (collapsed across learning and replacement phases), the strongest increase across the whole brain was in the medial temporal lobe, with a peak in the left posterior hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (  x   = −30;   y   = −28;   z   = −14;   Z  -score = 4.65; SVC FWE   P   = 0.001; see  A and Table ) and another subpeak that was part of the same cluster in the anterior hippocampus (  x   = −27;   y   = −19;   z   = −17;   Z  -score = 3.56).

Percent signal change in a 10 mm sphere around the left anterior hippocampal peak for all four conditions (below, mean ± SEM).

Main Effect of Environmental Novelty 
  
In a post-hoc statistical analysis based on 10 mm spheres around the peak hippocampal voxel for environmental novelty, the left posterior hippocampus cluster also responded to object novelty (  F   = 7.584;   P   = 0.014), but no interaction between environmental and object novelty was observed (  F   = 0.019;   P   = 0.892). Despite our posterior hippocampal peak also responding to object novelty, we found that the posterior hippocampus showed a significantly stronger response to environmental novelty than to object novelty [t(17) = 3.350;   P   = 0.004]. We also found increases related to environmental novelty in the left cerebellum, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left angular gyrus, right precuneus, right superior parietal lobule, and right caudate (see Table ). Additionally, subthreshold right hippocampal activations for environmental novelty were observed at   P   < 0.005 uncorrected. A post-hoc paired t-test conducted on data extracted from 10 mm spheres around left and right hippocampus peak voxels did not reveal a significant difference between the left and right hippocampus in their response to environmental novelty [t(17) = 1.515;   P   = 0.148]. There were no significant increases in the brain for environmental familiarity. 


#### Object novelty 
  
We found a main effect for novel versus familiar objects, regardless of environment, in the bilateral parahippocampal/fusiform gyrus that was strongest in the right hemisphere (right peak:   x   = 39;  y   = −40;   z   = −14;   Z  -score = 4.10; whole-brain cluster-level FWE   P   = 0.002; see  C and Table ). There was also a significant MTL cluster in the left anterior hippocampus (  x   = −24;   y   = −19;   z   = −17;   Z  -score = 3.81; SVC FWE   P   = 0.032; see  B and Table ), which extended into the amygdala and left superior temporal sulcus. Post-hoc statistical analyses measured from a 10 mm sphere around the posterior parahippocampal/fusiform gyrus peak found that it was not sensitive to environmental novelty (  F   = 1.991,   P   = 0.176) and showed no interaction between object and environmental novelty effects (  F   = 1.505;   P   = 0.237). Notably, the anterior hippocampal peak overlapped with the subpeak from the environmental novelty contrast, which was reflected in post-hoc statistical analyses that showed that the anterior hippocampus was also sensitive to environmental novelty (  F   = 6.486;   P   = 0.021), but displayed no interaction between the two novelty effects. Further analyses showed that the anterior hippocampus was not differentially responsive to object novelty or environmental novelty [  t  (17) = 0.766;   P   = 0.454]. We also found significant increases related to object novelty in the cingulate gyrus and right angular gyrus (see Table ). There were no significant increases anywhere in the brain for object familiarity. 
  
Main Effect of Object Novelty 
  


### Novelty × Experimental Phase Interactions 
  
We did not find any significant interactions in the medial temporal lobe between object novelty and experimental phase, or between environmental novelty and experimental phase. In other words, the MTL object and environmental novelty effects did not differ as a function of learning versus replacement phase. However, an environmental novelty by experimental phase interaction was seen in bilateral ventral pallidum, strongest on the right side (left:   x   = −15;   y   = −1;   z   = −11;   Z  -score = 3.56; right:   x   = 15;   y   = −10;   z   = −8;   Z  -score = 4.34; see  D). We also found a significant interaction between environmental novelty and experimental phase in the midbrain/ventral tegmental area (VTA;   x   = 3;   y   = −19;   z   = −5;   Z  -score = 3.57) and right caudate. Notably, environmental novelty related activity was higher in the replacement versus the learning phase in the ventral pallidum and midbrain/VTA, while the caudate showed the opposite effect of being higher in the learning phase than the replacement phase. Additionally, we observed a significant interaction between object novelty and experimental phase in the cerebellum and cingulate gyrus, where object novelty related increases during navigation were higher in the object replacement versus learning phase. 


### Short-Term Effects of Novelty During Learning 
  
We investigated how the above environmental and object novelty effects changed across time during the learning phase. We split learning phases into four quartiles (matching the four repetitions of object-location encoding during the learning phase) and assessed both environmental and object novelty across these quartiles. Searching for a linear decrease of environmental novelty from quartiles 1–4 failed to reveal any significant regions in the MTL or neocortex. However, a significant linear decrease in the object novelty effect (i.e., novel – familiar) from the first to fourth quartile was seen in the left amygdala (peak:   x   = −27;   y   = −1;   z   = −14;   Z  -score = 3.65; uncorrected   P   = 0.000131; FWE SVC   P   =.074), left lateral occipital cortex (peak:   x   = −30;   y   = −85;   z   = −20;   Z  -score = 4.50), left fusiform gyrus (peak:   x   = −48;   y   = −55;   z   = −17;   Z  -score = 3.74), and left posterior parahippocampal cortex (peak:   x   = −36;   y   = −37;   z   = −17;   Z  -score = 3.87). See  . Other areas showing a significant decrease in the object novelty effect from the first to fourth quartile were the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, left middle temporal gyrus, and right angular gyrus. These analyses add to our original object novelty effects (comparing whole sessions) by revealing several novelty signals that attenuate within each session. By contrast, environmental novelty signals appear to attenuate only over the slower timescale of sessions, perhaps indicating that learning environmental layout is a slower process than some of the short-term effects of object novelty.

Above: Left amygdala activity (peak:   x   = −27;   y   = −1;   z   = −14;   Z  -score = 3.65) corresponding object novelty (novel versus familiar objects) showed a linear decrease over the course of the learning phase as relative novelty decreased. Below: Percent signal change extracted from a 10 mm sphere around the peak left amygdala voxel averaged across 18 participants for novel versus familiar objects for the first to fourth quartile of the learning phase.

## DISCUSSION 
  
We investigated environmental and object novelty during a spatial navigation task. We found environmental and object novelty effects throughout the MTL, including the hippocampus ( ). Environmental novelty effects were seen in the mid-posterior hippocampus, anterior hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Object novelty effects were seen in the anterior hippocampus, fusiform/parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala. Notably, the more posterior hippocampal region showed a greater response to environmental than object novelty, while the anterior hippocampus peak responded to both environmental and object novelty. Thus, we provide evidence for distinct, though partially overlapping, MTL networks for processing environmental and object novelty. 

Our finding that the anterior hippocampus responds to both object novelty and environmental novelty is consistent with previous fMRI studies showing anterior hippocampal responses to the novelty of a variety of stimuli ( ;  ;  ;  ,b; Kumaran and  ). To our knowledge, our findings are the first to show responses to both environmental and object novelty during goal-directed virtual navigation. However, our results also suggest a partial dissociation within the hippocampus, with more posterior hippocampal regions showing a greater response to environmental novelty than to object novelty. Mid-posterior hippocampal activation related to environmental novelty is consistent with a role in learning environmental layout, including the spatial relations between the various topographical features of the environment (the environmental boundary and the distant mountains). This fits with the known role of the hippocampus in encoding spatial layout (e.g.,  ;  ) and when navigating more accurately ( ;  ). The findings are also consistent with a more general hippocampal role in representing relational information (Eichenbaum and  ) and with rodent studies showing hippocampal involvement in detecting environmental novelty ( ,  ;  ,  ;  ;  ). An important potential research direction will be determining whether the anterior hippocampus might function as a convergence zone ( ) for processing both object/item and environmental/contextual novelty ( ;  ;  ; Ranganath and  ) and how these hippocampal processing distinctions relate to ideas about “nonspatial” and “spatial” processing streams within the MTL ( ). Notably, we did not find any novelty processing differences between learning and object replacement phases in the hippocampus, or the rest of MTL. Future studies can explore how hippocampal sub-regions might process novelty differently depending on whether a subregion needs to either encode or retrieve an item/context. 

Outside of the hippocampus, we found that the parahippocampal/fusiform gyrus responded to object novelty and that more anterior parts of the parahippocampal gyrus responded to environmental novelty. Our finding of parahippocampal responses to environmental novelty is in line with previous fMRI findings showing that the parahippocampal cortex responds to novel scenes (Epstein and  ;  ). However, our activation was slightly anterior to the “place area” regions typically associated with the perceptual processing of environmental scenes, and so may relate more specifically to the learning of environmental layout for the purposes of navigation, and the nearby activation of the hippocampus. In fact, our object novelty activation was located in these more posterior parahippocampal/fusiform regions. We assume that this activation reflects the introduction of a novel navigationally relevant object into posterior parahippocampal representations of the environment (Janzen and van  ;  ). That is, the effect of object novelty in this region reflects the fact that the objects themselves are navigationally relevant components of the wider spatial environment. Nonetheless, fusiform regions are also thought to be involved in representing individual objects ( ;  ; Horner and  ), so the fusiform object-novelty activation may also reflect the learning of novel object representations. 

We also found effects of object novelty in the amygdala. These results parallel previous fMRI findings showing amygdala and anterior hippocampal responses to novelty ( ;  ;  ;  ). They also accord with rodent studies showing that amygdala lesions impair object novelty detection ( ,  ), and with human intracranial recordings showing amygdala (and sometimes anterior hippocampal) responses to novel or surprising events ( ;  ;  ). The amygdala activity during learning was characterized by a linear reduction in response to novel objects across repetitions, with the maximal effect for the first presentation of the object. This rapidly decaying amygdala activation might reflect a temporary novelty-related increase in salience as opposed to our novelty responses over the longer timescale of trials, which we tentatively related to learning. Rapidly attenuating amygdala activations have also been seen in response to emotional/arousing stimuli ( ;  ;  ;  ). 

One caveat for the interpretation of our findings is that we only studied males, to avoid compromising our result with the additional uncontrolled variable of the sexual dimorphism in neural bases of spatial navigation ( ; see   and   for reviews). Gender differences could especially be important for the amygdala and anterior hippocampus results, since hormonal release potentially modulates behavior in these areas during mnemonic function (Strange and  ). Further study will be needed to see if our findings generalize to females, or whether they differ between the sexes. And further replication will be required to corroborate the rapidly attenuating amygdala object novelty effect during the learning phase, which did not pass correction for multiple comparisons. 

Although our MTL novelty effects did not differ across the learning and replacement phases, we did observe that ventral pallidum and midbrain/VTA BOLD activity was higher during navigation in novel versus familiar environments during the replacement phase, while environmental novelty related activity in the caudate was higher during the learning phase. The ventral pallidum and midbrain/VTA effects are consistent with findings highlighting strong responses in ventral basal ganglia and midbrain/VTA regions for images of novel versus familiar scenes ( ). Our ventral pallidum findings match rodent studies showing this region as a key interchange between limbic and movement-planning circuitry that helps guide goal-directed exploratory movement (Yang and  ; for review see Mogenson and  ), while our caudate findings might relate to the formation of more route-like representations from one object location to another as their locations are learned, consistent with the parallel hippocampal and striatal involvement in the learning of “places” and “responses” (e.g., Packard and  ;  ; White and  ;  ;  ). Although further replication is needed, our results might reflect a potential role for interactions between the MTL and basal ganglia in guiding the memory of novel contexts (see reviews by  ; van der  ) and in disambiguating overlapping routes ( ; Brown and  ). 


## CONCLUSION 
  
We employed a naturalistic virtual reality navigation paradigm to assess how the human brain processes novel environments and their contents (i.e., object-location associations). We found that the anterior hippocampus responded to both environmental and object novelty during navigation, whereas mid to posterior hippocampus preferentially responded to environmental novelty, consistent with a role in representing the layout of a new environment. Our results suggest that the MTL is crucial in processing both object and environmental novelty during spatial navigation and that novelty processing is likely to be supported by a distinct, but partially overlapping, set of regions in the MTL.

# Abstract
 
Understanding the neural basis of consciousness is fundamental to neuroscience research. Disruptions in cortico-cortical connectivity have been suggested as a primary mechanism of unconsciousness. By using a novel combination of positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we studied anesthesia-induced unconsciousness and recovery using the α -agonist dexmedetomidine. During unconsciousness, cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and cerebral blood flow were preferentially decreased in the thalamus, the Default Mode Network (DMN), and the bilateral Frontoparietal Networks (FPNs). Cortico-cortical functional connectivity within the DMN and FPNs was preserved. However, DMN thalamo-cortical functional connectivity was disrupted. Recovery from this state was associated with sustained reduction in cerebral blood flow and restored DMN thalamo-cortical functional connectivity. We report that loss of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is sufficient to produce unconsciousness.

Although we are all familiar with the experience of being conscious, explaining precisely what consciousness is and how it arises from activity in the brain remains extremely challenging. Indeed, explaining consciousness is so challenging that it is sometimes referred to as ‘the hard question’ of neuroscience. 

One way to obtain insights into the neural basis of consciousness is to compare patterns of activity in the brains of conscious subjects with patterns of brain activity in the same subjects under anesthesia. The results of some experiments of this kind suggest that loss of consciousness occurs when the communication between specific regions within the outer layer of the brain, the cortex, is disrupted. However, other studies seem to contradict these findings by showing that this communication can sometimes remain intact in unconscious subjects. 

Akeju, Loggia et al. have now resolved this issue by using brain imaging to examine the changes that occur as healthy volunteers enter and emerge from a light form of anesthesia roughly equivalent to non-REM sleep. An imaging technique called PET revealed that the loss of consciousness in the subjects was accompanied by reduced activity in a structure deep within the brain called the thalamus. Reduced activity was also seen in areas of cortex at the front and back of the brain. 

A technique called fMRI showed in turn that communication between the cortex and the thalamus was disrupted as subjects drifted into unconsciousness, whereas communication between cortical regions was spared. As subjects awakened from the anesthesia, communication between the thalamus and the cortex was restored. 

These results suggest that changes within distinct brain regions give rise to different depths of unconsciousness. Loss of communication between the thalamus and the cortex generates the unconsciousness of sleep or light anesthesia, while the additional loss of communication between cortical regions generates the unconsciousness of general anesthesia or coma. In addition to explaining the mixed results seen in previous experiments, this distinction could lead to advances in the diagnosis of patients with disorders of consciousness, and even to the development of therapies that target the thalamus and its connections with cortex.

## Introduction 
  
Understanding the neural mechanisms of consciousness is a fundamental challenge of current neuroscience research. We note that precise definitions of the words ‘consciousness’ and ‘unconsciousness’ remain ambiguous. However, loss of voluntary response in a task is an effective and clinically relevant definition of unconsciousness. Over the past decade, important insights have been gained by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the brain during sleep, and disorders of consciousness (DOC) such as coma, vegetative states, and minimally conscious states ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In addition to being critical for patients to safely and humanely undergo traumatic surgical or diagnostic procedures, anesthesia has long been recognized as a tool for studying the neural mechanisms of loss and recovery of consciousness ( ). 

Disruption of cortico-cortical connectivity has been proposed as a central mechanism to explain unconsciousness associated with general anesthesia, sleep, and DOC ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, recent evidence suggests that cortico-cortical functional connectivity may be maintained during unconsciousness ( ;  ;  ). To develop more precise neuroanatomic and neurophysiological characterizations of this and other putative mechanisms, studies of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness could benefit from the use of multimodal imaging approaches, combined with neurophysiological understanding of the brain state induced by the anesthetic drug being studied. 

A challenge in using anesthetics to study unconsciousness is stating precise, possible mechanisms of anesthetic-induced brain states, and using an anesthetic which acts at single rather than multiple brain targets to test those mechanism ( ;  ;  ). Among the several anesthetics in current use today, dexmedetomidine is an appealing choice for testing a specific mechanism of how an anesthetic alters the level of consciousness. Dexmedetomidine selectively targets pre-synaptic α -adrenergic receptors on neurons projecting from the locus ceruleus to the pre-optic area ( ;  ;  ). This leads to activation of inhibitory outputs to the major arousal centers in the midbrain, pons, and hypothalamus producing a neurophysiological and behavioral state that closely resembles NREM II sleep ( ) ( ;  ;  ). Dexmedetomidine also acts at the locus ceruleus projections to the intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus, the basal forebrain and the cortex ( ).    Schematic of dexmedetomidine signaling illustrating similarities to the mechanism proposed for the generation of non-rapid eye movement II sleep.  
Dexmedetomidine binds to α2 receptors on neurons emanating from the locus ceruleus to inhibit NE release in the POA. The disinhibited POA reduces arousal by means of GABA- and galanin-mediated inhibition of the midbrain, hypothalamic, and pontine arousal nuclei. Dexmedetomidine also acts at the locus ceruleus projections to the intralaminar nucleus of the hypothalamus, the basal forebrain and the cortex and on post-synaptic α2 receptors. 5HT, serotonin; Ach, acetylcholine; BF, basal forebrain; DA, dopamine; Dex; dexmedetomidine; DR, dorsal raphe; GABA, gamma aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A; Gal, galanin; His, histamine; LC, locus ceruleus; LDT, laterodorsal tegmental area; NE, norepinephrine; PAG, periaqueductal gray; POA, preoptic area; PPT, pedunculopontine tegmental area; TMN, tuberomamillary nucleus.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to use a novel integrated positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MR) approach to characterize brain resting-state network activity and metabolism during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. This strategy offers several appealing features. First, PET scanning using fludeoxyglucose ( F-FDG) provides a sensitive estimate of the brain's metabolic state in terms of the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMR ). Second, comparison of CMR  results with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) estimates obtained from pulsed Arterial Spin Labeling (pASL) fMRI signals allows a direct assessment of whether, as previously reported, flow-metabolism coupling is maintained during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness ( ). Third, we use the CMR  results to inform the brain functional connectivity analysis derived from the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals. 


## Results 
  
### Decreased CMRglc in the Default Mode Network (DMN), Fronto Parietal Networks (FPNs), and thalamus during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness 
  
In 10 healthy volunteers, we used EEG recordings, and an auditory task to confirm that dexmedetomidine induced a loss of voluntary responsiveness, and exhibited a neurophysiological profile that was similar to non rapid eye movement (NREM) II sleep ( ). We then studied  F-FDG uptake during baseline and dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness in these 10 healthy volunteers in a separate experiment where we defined loss of consciousness as the onset of sustained eye closure and lack of response to a verbal request to open the eyes ( ). During both the baseline and dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness  F-FDG study visits (two per subject), fMRI data were also recorded. Consistent with a global decrease in glucose metabolism, we found that during the unconscious state, there was a broad reduction in  F-FDG standardized uptake values in the brain ( ). To quantify this result, we calculated CMR  during the two  F-FDG visits ( ). We found reduced CMR  in thalamic, frontal, and parietal brain regions during the unconscious state ( ,  ). The difference in CMR  exhibited a spatial distribution consistent with the previously described DMN ( ;  ) and both left and right FPNs ( ) ( ;  ). We found these network-specific CMR  changes interesting because the DMN has been linked to stimulus-independent thought and self-consciousness ( ;  ;  ), while the FPNs have been linked to conscious perception of the external environment and executive control initiation ( ;  ).    CMR  and rCBF are decreased in both the default mode and the frontal–parietal network brain regions during unconsciousness.

### Decreased rCBF in DMN, FPN, and thalamus during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness 
  
To further understand the effects of dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness on rCBF and brain functional connectivity in these networks, we increased our statistical power for fMRI data analysis by studying an additional seven volunteers using fMRI only ( ). Analysis of the rCBF difference maps between the unconscious and baseline states showed decreases in rCBF during unconsciousness that overlapped with the same DMN and FPN regions that demonstrated reductions in CMR  ( ,  ,  ). This is consistent with maintenance of blood flow and metabolism coupling during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness.

### Decreased thalamo-cortical and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness 
  
Given that we observed reduced flow and metabolism in regions known to correspond to the DMN and FPNs ( ;  ;  ), we next asked whether intrinsic functional connectivity within these networks was altered with dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. First, we confirmed that during both wakefulness and unconsciousness, the DMN and bilateral FPNs were consistently identified in our volunteers ( ,  ). Next, we performed a comparison of changes in these networks between the unconscious and awake states. When we compared the DMN between these two states, we found no difference in functional connectivity between the cortical regions of the DMN and FPNs, suggesting that cortico–cortico functional connectivity may be maintained during unconsciousness ( ,  ). However, we observed a reduction in functional connectivity between the thalamus and the DMN in the unconscious state ( ,  ). This loss of thalamic functional connectivity was observed in a region consistent with intralaminar, midline, mediodorsal, and ventral anterior nuclei. However, our ability to precisely resolve the thalamic nuclei implicated in loss of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is limited because our methods are not sensitive to small focal differences. We also found that functional connectivity of the left cerebellar representation of the DMN ( ) was significantly reduced during unconsciousness ( ,  ). When we compared the FPNs in these two states, we found that the left and right FPNs showed opposite changes in functional connectivity with a cerebellar cluster, likely indicating a switch in hemispheric dominance for cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity to this region during unconsciousness ( ,  ,  ). Functional connectivity of the cerebellar representations of the FPNs ( ) was also significantly reduced ( ,  ,  ). Since cortico-cerebellar connections are mediated by the thalamus ( ), the changes we observed in cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity are likely related to impaired thalamic functioning. Taken together, these results show that unconsciousness is associated with decreased thalamic CMR , rCBF, and functional connectivity to the DMN and support the notion that the thalamus plays a critical role in mediating unconsciousness.

### Seed-based thalamic connectivity during unconsciousness showed reduced thalamic functional connectivity to posterior cingulate, precuneus, and inferior parietal cortices 
  
In order to further examine the role of the thalamus in unconsciousness, we next performed a seed-based functional connectivity analysis using the thalamic region with decreased DMN functional connectivity as the seed region. This thalamic seed also overlapped with thalamic regions showing reduced rCBF and CMR . Our seed-based analysis allowed us to more thoroughly examine changes in thalamic functional connectivity to all brain regions. We found that the thalamic seed was significantly functionally disconnected from posterior regions of the DMN (posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobules) during unconsciousness ( ,  ). Notably, the cortical regions showing reduced thalamic functional connectivity also overlapped with those demonstrating reduced flow and metabolism ( ).

### Decreases in rCBF in the DMN, FPN, and thalamus do not immediately reverse during recovery from unconsciousness 
  
We next investigated whether the rCBF changes during the unconscious state returned to baseline during the recovery state. We identified 10 volunteers who responded to verbal instructions (opened eyes and gave a thumbs-up signal, though they were still mildly sedated) during at least 6 min of the recovery ASL scan. Surprisingly, when we compared the recovery state to the unconscious state in these volunteers, we found that the rCBF did not increase (cluster corrected,  ). In fact, when explored at a more liberal threshold (uncorrected, p < 0.05), further decreases in rCBF were observed ( ). When we compared the recovery state to the awake state, we found that the decrease in rCBF showed a spatial distribution similar to that observed during the unconscious state ( ). Next, we aligned all subjects to unconscious and recovery time points in order to study the dynamics of rCBF changes within the statistically significant clusters. We confirmed that rCBF decreased during loss of consciousness and that this decrease was maintained during recovery from this state in all regions analyzed ( ). These results suggest that cortical rCBF increase was not sufficient for the early stages of recovery from unconsciousness induced by dexmedetomidine.    Cortical increase in rCBF is not evident during the recovery of consciousness.

### Thalamo-cortical and cortical-cerebellar functional connectivity are restored during recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness 
  
We found that thalamic functional connectivity to the DMN was restored during the recovery state ( ,  ). We also found that the opposing left and right FPN changes in the cerebellar cluster ( ) were also reversed ( ,  ). When we analyzed the functional connectivity of our thalamic seed of interest, we found that thalamic functional connectivity to the posterior cingulate cortex and thalamo-thalamic functional connectivity were restored during the recovery state ( ,  ). Taken together, these results provide further evidence that dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness is associated with decreased thalamic functional connectivity to the DMN and supports the notion that the thalamus plays a critical role in mediating unconsciousness and recovery from this state.    Functional connectivity changes observed during recovery of consciousness.

## Discussion 
  
Resting-state functional brain imaging is increasingly being utilized to probe the mechanisms of consciousness ( ). By using a very site-specific drug, performing for the first time simultaneous measurements of CMR , rCBF, resting state BOLD low frequency oscillations, and analyzing both dexmedetomidine-induced loss of consciousness and recovery, we have been able to identify a minimal disruption of neural networks that is shared between altered consciousness states. Our results show that during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, cortico-cortical functional connectivity remains intact but thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is disrupted. This disrupted thalamo-cortical functional connectivity appropriately reverses during recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. 

### Thalamo-cortical correlates of altered arousal and unconsciousness 
  
The notion that disruption of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity could constitute a neural-network mechanism responsible for unconsciousness that is distinct from disruption of cortico-cortical functional connectivity is supported by a number of findings. During, NREM I and II sleep in humans, DMN cortico-cortical functional connectivity remains preserved ( ;  ) while thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is disrupted ( ). However, during NREM III, there is a functional disconnection between frontal and parietal nodes of the DMN ( ;  ), and disrupted thalamo-cortical functional connectivity ( ). Likewise, in-depth electrode studies in humans show that changes in thalamic activity during sleep precedes changes in cortical activity, suggesting that disrupted thalamo-cortical functional connectivity may underlie changes in consciousness ( ). Also, during propofol anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, decreases in thalamo-cortical functional connectivity, alongside disruptions in cortico-cortical functional connectivity in the DMN and FPNs, have been described in healthy volunteers ( ;  ) Functional reintegration of the thalamus to key regions of the cortex appears to be necessary for the recovery of consciousness from this state ( ). 


### A putative functional network for recovery from unconsciousness comprising the locus ceruleus, central thalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex 
  
Norepinephrinergic neurons in the locus ceruleus project to thalamic mediodorsal, midline, intralaminar nuclei, which in turn have neurons that project to the cingulate cortex ( ;  ;  ;  ). Our results show that these connections may comprise a functional circuit that is disrupted during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. Moreover, this functional circuit appears specifically to involve the posterior cingulate cortex, distinct from anterior or mid-cingulate cortex. In our thalamic seed-based functional connectivity analysis, we found that during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, thalamic regions consistent with intralaminar, midline, mediodorsal, and ventral anterior nuclei were functionally disconnected from posterior DMN structures (precuneus and the posterior cingulate cortex). Perhaps more importantly, recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness was associated with restored thalamo-thalamic and thalamic functional connectivity to the posterior cingulate cortex. Structural connectivity between the thalamus and the posterior cingulate cortex has also recently been correlated with the severity of DOC and used to subcategorize patients in minimally conscious states ( ). The above observations lead us to conclude that a noradrenergic circuit involving the thalamus and posterior cingulate cortex may be important for recovery from both dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness and DOC states. 


### Reduced cerebral blood flow during recovery of consciousness 
  
An FDG-PET study has recently described a linear relationship between metabolism in the precuneus and central thalamus in severely brain-injured patients with DOC ( ). We note that our observed reduction in blood flow in the precuneus and thalamus during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness parallels this result. However, during recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, we did not observe an increase in rCBF to any brain regions. Since our current and previously reported ( ) results suggest that dexmedetomidine does not decouple rCBF and CMRglc, we surmise that metabolism does not return to baseline during the earliest phases of recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. Thus, the reduced rCBF we report after recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness could reflect a residual drug effect state in which subjects are responsive to external stimuli but remain in a sedated state. This residual effect may be mediated by the broad and diffuse nor-adrenergic projections from the locus ceruleus to the rest of the brain ( ). 

This result is interesting because it suggests that recovery from unconsciousness may occur in a graded fashion. For example, performance on more complex cognitive tasks likely differs substantially between the awake and recovery states. This suggests that re-establishment of functional connectivity between vital brain regions precedes increases in rCBF and CMRglc. Return of rCBF and CMRglc to baseline levels may be indicative of the final stages of recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. Future investigations incorporating cognitive and psychomotor vigilance tasks during recovery from experimental models of unconsciousness would lend further insight on whether this is a drug-specific effect. Nevertheless, this finding is interesting because it suggests that recovery from unconsciousness states may proceed prior to significant increases in rCBF. 


### Different states of unconsciousness may reflect a hierarchy of disruption in functional circuits 
  
Drawing from previous work on sleep ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and anesthesia ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), our results suggest a hierarchy of brain network disruptions that can result in different states of altered consciousness. In NREM II (non-slow wave) sleep and dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, patients can be easily aroused to respond to verbal commands by sufficiently strong external stimuli. In these states, cortico-cortical functional connectivity is preserved ( ;  ), but thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is disrupted ( ). In propofol anesthesia-induced unconsciousness and some DOC states, where patients cannot be aroused by external stimuli, both cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity are disrupted ( ). 

In the case of sleep, dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, and some minimally conscious states, maintained cortico-cortical functional connectivity likely allows for the cortex to be ‘primed’, ready to recover from the altered consciousness states with restoration of thalamic functional connectivity, which could be triggered by ascending midbrain and brainstem inputs ( ) or direct therapeutic intervention at the thalamic level ( ;  ). In other altered consciousness states, such as during general anesthesia or comatose states, markedly disrupted cortico-cortical functional connectivity could further impair the ability to recover consciousness. We note that while it might be theoretically possible to attain unconsciousness by disrupting only cortico-cortical functional connectivity while preserving thalamo-cortical functional connectivity, it appears, from our study and others, that this does not happen during sleep and anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. 

Compared to the findings supporting a role for disrupted cortico-cortical functional connectivity during unconsciousness, our findings suggest that thalamo-cortical connectivity constitutes a more fundamental disruption required to produce unconsciousness. This insight could lead to a more objective characterization, diagnosis, and prognosis of DOC. Also, the state of cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity could be used to better select patients who may benefit from therapeutic interventions. For instance, in the event of maintained cortico-cortical functional connectivity but impaired thalamo-cortical functional connectivity with intact thalamo-cortical structural connections ( ), therapies aimed at restoring thalamo-cortical functional connectivity might be more likely to help patients recover. These therapies could be pharmacological ( ), electrical ( ), or could involve other forms of stimulation. Since dexmedetomidine appears to disrupt functional network activity in a manner similar to NREM II sleep, our results also suggest that alpha-2-receptor agonists could be further developed as effective sleep therapeutic drugs. 


### Subjective awareness during sleep and anesthesia 
  
At present, there is a debate pertaining to whether anesthetized and unresponsive patients (without motor impairments) can remain internally conscious to subjective experiences (internally generated or provoked by external stimuli). This debate has been fueled by clinical studies of anesthetized patients that have reported rare intraoperative episodes of awareness (resulting from light anesthetic depth) under anesthesia ( ) and dreaming under anesthesia ( ;  ;  ;  ). Noreika et al. studied this phenomenon with dexmedetomidine, sevoflurane, propofol, and xenon ( ) and confirmed that subjective experiences of consciousness occur during clinically defined unconsciousness states. However, the experimental paradigm that was used to test for subjective experiences of consciousness involved a gradual increase in drug concentrations. This empiric gradual increase did not directly target anesthetic drug dosing to a neurophysiologically defined brain state nor does it inform us on the amount of time that was spent in lighter levels of anesthesia. Thus, the reported subjective experiences could have occurred when the drug concentration levels were very low. This line of reasoning is supported by evidence confirming that subjective experiences of dreaming under general anesthesia likely occur when patients are emerging from general anesthesia ( ). 

Subjective experiences of consciousness also occur during REM sleep ( ). To a limited degree, they are also thought to occur during NREM sleep, especially at sleep onset in NREM I and during NREM II sleep periods encountered later at night ( ). However, the current methods for scoring sleep states remain imprecise and highly subjective, with limited state and temporal resolution, and high intra- and inter-scorer variability, raising the possibility that clinically scored NREM I and II sleep may include periods of arousal. In clinical sleep scoring, trained technicians visually score the sleep time-series data in 30-s epochs according to semantically defined sleep stages. These scoring standards grossly simplify sleep electroencephalographic dynamics. For example, consider the characterization of sleep onset. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine defines sleep onset as the first appearance of any 30-s epoch that contains at least 15 s of sleep ( ). This implies that sleep onset is a binary process. However, recent EEG studies in humans clearly demonstrate that sleep onset, at both a neurophysiological and behavioral level, is a continuous process. As such, methods designed to track moment-to-moment continuous variations in the EEG are significantly better at predicting when subjects lose wakefulness, measured in terms of a behavioral task, than traditional sleep scoring methods ( ). In particular, subjects can continue to perform awake behavior despite being scored as asleep (NREM I) using traditional sleep scoring methods. Thus, it is possible that the subjective experiences of consciousness that have been ascribed to NREM sleep could have occurred during subjectively scored sleep stages that included un-scored periods of arousal or wakefulness. 

Despite this rapidly evolving understanding of subjective experiences during altered arousal under sleep and anesthesia, we have tried in this study to focus on a particular state of dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. We achieved this state through rapid administration of dexmedetomidine and confirmed that this dose and form of drug administration produces a NREM II-like state ( ). We then applied a combination of fMRI and FDG-PET imaging that would characterize the overall time-integrated brain activity during this state. Clinical evidence shows that motor-evoked potentials, and thus motor function from cortex down, remain intact in this state, making it unlikely that the loss of responsiveness we observed is only a result of disrupted motor function ( ;  ). Therefore, we feel it is appropriate to refer to the state of altered arousal described in this manuscript as dexmedetomdine-induced unconsciousness. 

A long-standing debate in anesthesiology relates to the fundamental systems-level mechanisms for anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, with some investigators proposing a thalamic switch ( ) and others proposing disrupted cortico-cortical connections as the central mechanism ( ;  ;  ). Our results, in combination with previous work, resolve this conflict by showing how both mechanisms could co-exist but at different parts of the continuum of altered arousal or unconsciousness. Moreover, it suggests a mechanistic interpretation for varying levels of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, where disrupted thalamo-cortical functional connectivity, but intact cortico-cortical functional connectivity reflects lighter states of unconsciousness and disruptions of both cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity reflect deeper states of unconsciousness. These insights could guide development of system-specific anesthetic drugs that possess minimal side effects and improved monitoring of patients in both the operating room and intensive care settings. 



## Materials and methods 
  
### Subject selection 
  
This study was conducted at the Athinoula A Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at the Massachusetts General Hospital. The Human Research Committee and the Radioactive Drug Research Committee at the Massachusetts General Hospital approved the study protocol. After an initial email/phone screen, potential study subjects were invited to participate in a screening visit. At the screening visit, informed consent including the consent to publish was requested after the nature and possible consequences of the study was explained. All subjects provided informed consent and were American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status I with Mallampati Class I airway anatomy. After providing informed consent, a standard pre-anesthesia assessment was administered and a blood toxicology screen was performed to ensure that subjects were not taking drugs that might confound the interpretation of study results. A complete metabolic panel and a urine pregnancy test were also obtained to confirm that all values were within normal ranges and to confirm non-pregnant status, respectively. A total of 20 subjects participated in screening visits and 18 subjects were deemed eligible to participate in the study protocol. Two subjects were deemed ineligible after medical evaluation and one subject was lost to follow-up after providing informed consent. During all study visits, subjects were required to take nothing by mouth for at least 8 hr. A urine toxicology screen was performed to ensure that subjects had not taken drugs that might confound interpretation of the results. A pregnancy test was also administered (serum for PET visits, urine for fMRI only visits) for each female subject to confirm non-pregnant status. 


### Imaging visit 
  
We studied awake, unconscious, and recovery states in humans, using an integrated positron PET/MR approach, in healthy volunteers, 18–36 years of age. Brain imaging was performed with the Biograph mMR scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), which allows simultaneous acquisition of whole-body PET and 3 Tesla MRI data. The fully integrated PET detectors use avalanche photoiodide technology and lutetium oxyorthosilicate crystals (8 × 8 arrays of 4 × 4 × 20 mm  crystals). The PET scanner's transaxial and axial fields of view are 594 mm and 25.8 cm, respectively ( ). Approximately, 5 mCi of FDG was purchased from an outside approved vendor and was administered as a bolus immediately before the initiation of the dexmedetomidine (described below). A PET-compatible 16-channel head and neck array was used to acquire the MR data. 

At the beginning of the imaging visit, we acquired structural MRI (MPRAGE volume, TR/TE = 2100/3.24 ms, flip angle = 7°, voxel size = 1 mm isotropic) for the purpose of anatomical localization, spatial normalization, and surface visualization of the imaging data. A 6:08 min pASL scan and a 6:15 min BOLD fMRI scans were performed (‘awake’ pASL and BOLD scans;  ), in order to assess rCBF and functional connectivity at baseline. The pASL scans were collected using the ‘PICORE-Q2TIPS’ MRI labeling method ( ) (TR/TE/TI1/TI2 = 3000/13/700/1700 ms, voxel size = 3.5*3.5*5 mm, number of slices = 16). ‘Tag’ images were acquired by labeling a thick inversion slab (110 mm), proximal to the imaging slices (gap = 21.1 mm). ‘Control’ images were acquired interleaved with the tag images, by applying an off-resonance inversion pulse without any spatial encoding gradient. At the beginning of each pASL scan, an M  scan (i.e., the longitudinal magnetization of fully relaxed tissue) was acquired for rCBF quantification purposes. The pASL imaging volume common to all subjects scanned covered most of the cerebrum, and extended ventrally to the midbrain and dorsally to the vertex ( ). BOLD fMRI data were collected using a whole brain T2*-weighted gradient echo BOLD echo planar imaging pulse sequence was used (TR/TE = 3000/35 ms, flip angle = 90°, voxel size = 2.3 × 2.3 × 3.8 mm, number of slices = 35). 

After the awake scans, dexmedetomidine was administered as a 1 mcg/kg loading bolus over 10 min, followed by a 0.7 mcg/kg/hr infusion to maintain unconsciousness. Another pASL scan was initiated at the onset of the dexmedetomidine infusion, with identical imaging parameters as the awake pASL scan, except for a longer duration (20:08 min). This longer acquisition was performed in order to ensure that perfusion data were collected for a long enough period to capture the transition from the awake to the unconscious state. During the infusion period, the study anesthesiologists monitored cuff blood pressure, capnography, electrocardiogram, and pulse-oximetry. Volunteers were instructed to keep their eyes open during the course of the study; loss of consciousness was defined as the onset of sustained eye closure and lack of response to a verbal request to open the eyes. After the onset of unconsciousness, we then performed a 6:15 min ‘unconscious’ BOLD fMRI scan (to evaluate unconsciousness-related changes in functional connectivity). After acquisition of all images, the dexmedetomidine infusion was discontinued, and a 20:08 min pASL scan was performed to assess changes in rCBF upon recovery. Spontaneous eye opening and a positive response to give a thumbs-up signal were used to determine recovery of consciousness. All 10 subjects who experienced spontaneous eye opening during the final 6:08 min of the recovery of consciousness pASL successfully executed on the thumbs-up signal request. An additional 6:15 min ‘recovery’ BOLD fMRI scan was performed, in order to assess variations in functional connectivity upon recovery. 


### Data analysis 
  
PET data collected from 10 subjects (two visits each) and stored in list mode format were binned into sinograms. In addition to the static frame corresponding to 40–60 min post FDG administration, dynamic frames of progressively longer duration were generated for quantitative analysis. PET images were reconstructed using an ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithm, with 3 iterations and 21 subsets. Corrections were applied to account for variable detector efficiencies and dead time, photon attenuation and scatter and radioactive decay using the software provided by the manufacturer. We employed a method that is similar to the generation of attenuation maps for computed tomography data to generate our head attenuation maps from the MPRAGE data. This head attenuation map was combined with the hardware (i.e., RF coil, patient table, etc) attenuation map provided by the manufacturer. Spatial smoothing was performed post-reconstruction using a 4 mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. 

Standardized uptake values (SUV; i.e., mean radioactivity/injected dose/weight) were computed voxelwise from the emission data collected 40–60 min post-injection. In order to quantitatively assess metabolic changes, cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) were computed from the dynamic PET frames with the non-invasive method proposed by  , using the whole-brain as our reference region. SUV and CMRglc maps were then coregistered with the high resolution MRI scan using BBREGISTER tool ( ) from the FreeSurfer suite ( ), normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using nonlinear registration (FNIRT, from the FSL suite; FMRIB's Software Library,  ) ( ) and then smoothed with an 8 mm FWHM kernel. A paired, whole-brain, voxel wise, mixed effects analysis was conducted to compare SUV and CMRglc across visits (n = 10). Statistical parametric maps were thresholded using clusters determined by a voxel-wise threshold (Z > 2.3) and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of p = 0.05 ( ). 

fMRI data were collected from 17 subjects. However, BOLD data (awake, unconscious, and recovery) were successfully collected in only 15 subjects. This is because BOLD data was collected with a different set of parameters in one subject and another subject exited the scanner immediately prior to the recovery BOLD scan. ASL data preprocessing was performed using a combination of analysis packages including FSL, and Freesurfer. The ‘tag’, ‘control’, and M  scans were first motion-corrected using MCFLIRT ( ). Then, tag and control scans were surround subtracted (i.e., given each tag , [(control  + control  )/2 − tag ]) to achieve perfusion-weighted images. Quantification of rCBF was performed using the ASLtbx toolbox ( ;  ) from the following data: the whole 6 min awake scan, the last 6 min of the 20 min induction of unconsciousness scan (i.e., the portion of the scan during which all subjects were unconscious; ‘unconscious’ scan) and the last 6 min of the 20-min recovery of consciousness scan (i.e., the portion of the scan during which 10 subjects had recovered; ‘recovery’ scan). 

rCBF maps were coregistered with the high resolution MR scan using Freesurfer's BBREGISTER tool ( ), normalized to MNI space using nonlinear registration (FNIRT) ( ) and then smoothed with a 7 mm FWHM kernel. A paired, voxel wise, mixed effects analyses were conducted to compare rCBF between the awake and unconscious states data (n = 17). This contrast was computed only within voxels imaged in all subjects (see   for coverage common to all subjects), as assessed through the computation of a conjunction mask from all the MNI-registered M  scans. Given that rCBF estimation in the white matter presents methodological challenges (particularly given the poor signal-to-noise ratio and longer arterial transit time) ( ), voxels classified as white matter in (the arbitrary value of) ≥ 70% of subjects by the Harvard–Oxford Subcortical Structural Atlas (Center for Morphometric Analyses,  ) were excluded from the analyses. 

Subsequently, another paired analysis was performed to compare rCBF between the unconscious and recovery states. In this analysis, only the 10 subjects who were awake for the full duration of the last 6 min of the 20-min recovery scans were included. This analysis was focused within search areas determined by the statistically significant clusters in the ‘unconscious vs awake’ contrast. Unless otherwise specified, all rCBF statistical parametric maps were thresholded using clusters determined by a voxel-wise threshold (Z > 2.3) and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of p = 0.05 ( ). 

Resting-state BOLD fMRI data were used to perform functional connectivity analyses. Datasets were slice-timing corrected (SLICETIMER), motion-corrected (MCFLIRT), brain-extracted (BET), registered to MPRAGE (BBREGISTER) and then to the MNI152 atlas (FNIRT), smoothed with a 5 mm FMWH kernel and high-pass filtered (cutoff = 0.008 Hz). As ASL and PET analyses revealed that unconsciousness was associated with a reduction in glucose metabolism and rCBF in regions belonging to distinct resting-state networks (Default Mode and both Frontoparietal Control networks; DMN, FCN), we assessed how intrinsic functional connectivity of these specific networks was affected by unconsciousness, using the dual regression approach ( ;  ). All the preprocessed datasets were concatenated to create a single 4D dataset. A probabilistic Independent Component Analysis (pICA) ( ) was performed using Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC) on this concatenated 4D dataset, limiting the number of independent components (ICs) to 25, as in previous publications using the dual regression approach ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). From the pool of the 25 ICs, the DMN, right and left FCNs were clearly identified. Group-level spatial maps for each of these RSNs were used as a set of spatial regressors in a General Linear Model (GLM), in order to identify the individual subjects' time course associated with each group-level map. These time courses were then variance normalized and used as a set of temporal regressors in a GLM, to find subject-specific maps associated with the different group-level independent components. In this GLM, explanatory variables also included six motion parameters and the time courses from ventricles and white matter as covariates of no interest. Subject-specific maps were compared across states (awake, unconscious, recovery) using paired t-tests. As our dual regression ICA approach identified altered DMN functional connectivity to the thalamus, we used this thalamic region as a seed for seed-based functional connectivity analysis. This follow-up analysis was done with the purpose of (1) determining whether specific portions of the DMN (e.g., more posterior regions within the network) may be responsible for driving the effect and (2) assessing changes in functional connectivity between the thalamus and other, non-DMN regions. The extracted fMRI time series, variance normalized, was used as a regressor in a GLM for the awake, unconscious, and recovery data. The same nuisance regressors adopted in the dual regression analyses (see above), with the addition of global signal time course were used in the seed-based analyses. Statistical parametric maps were thresholded using clusters determined by a voxel-wise threshold (Z > 2.3) and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of p = 0.05 ( ). From representative clusters identified in the various analyses, data were extracted and displayed for illustrative purposes. Human brain atlases were used for anatomical reference of the cerebrum ( ) and the cerebellum ( ).

# Title

Acute Effects of Alcohol on the Human Brain: A Resting-State fMRI Study

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
The aim of this study is to assess the value of resting-state fMRI in detecting the acute effects of alcohol on healthy human brains. Thirty-two healthy volunteers were studied by conventional MR imaging and resting-state fMRI prior to and 0.5 hours after initiation of acute alcohol administration. The fMRI data, acquired during the resting state, were correlated with different breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC). We use the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus as a seed for the default mode network (DMN) analysis. ALFF and ReHo were also used to investigate spontaneous neural activity in the resting state. Conventional MR imaging showed no abnormalities on all subjects. Compared with the prior alcohol administration, the ALFF and ReHo also indicated some specific brain regions which are affected by alcohol, including the superior frontal gyrus, cerebellum, hippocampal gyrus, left basal ganglia, and right internal capsule. Functional connectivity of the DMN was affected by alcohol. This resting-state fMRI indicates that brain regions implicated are affected by alcohol and might provide a neural basis for alcohol's effects on behavioral performance.

## 1. Introduction 
  
Alcohol impairs cognitive function and is associated with a variety of behavioral changes resulting in deficits in perceptual and emotional function. Alcohol consumption has immediate effects on multiple cognitive-motor processing domains and leads to damage of multiple attentional abilities [ ]. Previously, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to understand the effects of alcohol on the human brain. Five independent critical brain circuits are significantly affected by relatively high levels (blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) = 0.1%) of alcohol, and functional network connectivity between the frontal-temporal-basal ganglia and the cerebellar circuits is specifically disrupted [ ,  ]. However, these studies were performed under task-based conditions. 

Recently, resting-state fMRI techniques have been applied to demonstrate abnormalities in various neuropsychiatric disorders [ ,  ]. The BOLD signal has been confirmed to indirectly reflect neural activity. The default mode network (DMN) has first been observed as a task-negative network, showing increased metabolic demand during the “baseline” activity and has therefore been hypothesized to reflect intrinsic default brain processes [ ]. The DMN spans the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), retrosplenial cortex (RspC), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), parts of the hippocampal formation, and the temporal lobe. A research indicated that the PCC/PCu node is particularly noteworthy, since after conditioning it was the only node in the DMN that directly interacted with virtually all other nodes. The PCC/PCu may play a pivotal role in how intrinsic activity is mediated throughout the DMN [ ]. 

Regional homogeneity (ReHo), a novel method that measures the functional connectivity, has been developed to analyze the local synchronization of spontaneous fMRI BOLD signals, reflecting the coherence of spontaneous neuronal activity [ ]. Unlike the functional connectivity involved in long-distance interregional temporal correlations of BOLD signals, ReHo, using Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC), displays the functional coherence of a given voxel with its nearest neighbors within a single region [ ]. The low-frequency (0.01–0.08 Hz) fluctuations (LFFs) of the resting-state fMRI signal were found to be physiologically important, reflecting spontaneous neuronal activity [ ]. ALFF was used to study several areas of neuroscience and neurological diseases including healthy aging, schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ ]. 

To assess the ability of fMRI to detect the acute effects of alcohol on healthy human brains, we used resting-state fMRI methods to investigate changes in the brain; we hypothesized that acute alcohol administration may alter connectivity measures of the resting-state DMN and have different ReHo and ALFF values in some brain areas when compared with controls. 


## 2. Materials and Methods 
  
### 2.1. Subjects 
  
Thirty-two healthy right-handed volunteers (17 men, 15 women; 25–27 years old) were examined by MRI before and after administration of alcohol. To be eligible for the study, potential volunteers were interviewed via telephone and asked a number of questions concerning their general health and medical history, in addition to questions especially related to their history of alcohol use and abuse. All participants provided written informed consent to the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee of the university hospital and institutional review boards. Participants consumed alcohol at a frequency of less than once per week and had no self-reported history of neurological disease, substance abuse, head trauma, CNS tumors, or psychoactive prescriptive medication usage. To ensure that the alcohol dose received in the study would be within the participants' normal range of experience, we excluded very heavy drinkers. To avoid interfering with alcohol absorption, subjects were requested to avoid consuming alcohol for 24 h and refrain from eating for 6 h prior to the study appointment. All participants were given a hand-held breathalyzer test to measure baseline alcohol levels, assuring participants were not already under the influence of alcohol. 

#### 2.1.1. Behavioral Evaluation 
  
Before and after alcohol administration, subjects were asked to evaluate their subjective sense of headache, excitement, dizziness, sleepiness, or confusion. 


#### 2.1.2. Study Protocol 
  
Subjects passing the screening process were invited to participate in the study. Before alcohol administration, we performed BOLD imaging using MRI to determine the baseline, making each participant serve as a control for the individual alcohol effect. After the examination, each received a dose of 0.65 g of alcohol per kilogram body weight orally within 10 minutes. The alcohol was given in the form of spirit (53° Maotai spirit, 2010, Renhuai, Guizhou, China). All drinks were mixed with some food, such as peanuts. BrAC is an index helping to estimate blood alcohol levels. BrAC was measured before and after each scan session using a hand-held breathalyzer 0.5 hours after alcohol administration. The subjects had to wait for 30 minutes until the BrAC reached its approximate maximum after alcohol administration [ ]. Participants were divided into two groups according to the BrAC: a low BrAC group (BrAC = 0–0.36 mg/L) and a high BrAC group (BrAC > 0.36 mg/L). There were 16 participants in each group. 



### 2.2. MR Imaging 
  
All anatomical and BOLD-sensitive MRI data were acquired using gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences in a 1.5T MRI scanner (GE) with an eight-channel-phased array head coil. Foam pads were used to reduce head movements and scanner noise. To measure the individual fMRI data, the imaging parameters were set as follows: slice thickness = 5 mm, slice gap = 1 mm, TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 30 ms, FOV = 24 cm × 24 cm, flip angle = 90°, and matrix = 64 × 64. 180 volumes (20 slices per volume) were acquired during 360 s of an fMRI run. During data acquisition, subjects were required to relax with eyes closed, not to fall asleep, and to move as little as possible. For anatomic data sets, we used a 3D-BRAVO sequence (thickness: 1.4 mm (no gap), TR = 8.2 ms, TE = 1.0 ms, FOV = 24 cm × 24 cm, flip angle = 25°, and matrix = 256 × 256). 


### 2.3. Data Processing 
  
Preprocessing of fMRI data was carried out using SPM8 and DPARSF software (  and  ). The first 10 volumes of each functional time series were discarded for the magnetization equilibrium. Head motion parameters were computed by estimating translational and rotational parameters. Each subject had a maximum displacement in a data set that did not exceed ±1.5 mm or ±1.5°. Functional images were normalized to a standard EPI template and interpolated to 3 × 3 × 3 mm cubic voxels. Following this step, all data were copied to two parts: one was smoothed with a 4 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) for functional connectivity and ALFF analysis and the other one was not smoothed for ReHo analysis. Then, data were temporal band-pass filtered (0.01 <   f   < 0.08 Hz) to reduce the effects of low-frequency drift and physiological high-frequency noise [ ], and the linear trend was removed. 


### 2.4. DMN Evaluation 
  
The functional connectivity of DMN was calculated using the REST software ( ). The voxel-based correlation approach was used to evaluate the temporally correlated BOLD signal associated with the functional connectivity of the DMN. We make a mask of PCC/PCu which was selected as regions of interest (ROI) from automated anatomical labeling (ALL) atlas. The averaged time course was then computed from each sphere and the correlation analysis was performed in a voxelwise way to generate the functional connectivity of the PCC/PCu. Prior to the correlation analysis, a linear regression was performed to remove the effects of nuisance covariates: the global mean signal, the white matter signal, the cerebrospinal fluid signal, and six head motion parameters. After that, the correlation coefficient maps were converted into   z   maps by Fisher's   r  -to-  z   transform to improve the normality. 


### 2.5. ReHo Calculation 
  
ReHo was defined as Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC) to study the similarity of the time series within a functional cluster based on the regional homogeneity hypothesis [ ]. In the current study, ReHo was used as the KCC of a given voxel with its 26 nearest neighboring voxels. These 27 voxels were defined as a cluster. The individual ReHo map was generated by calculating the KCC in a voxelwise way with free DPARSF software ( ). Then we used a default mask (made from the EPI template in the REST software) to remove nonbrain tissue, and, for standardization purposes, the individual ReHo map was divided by its own mean KCC value within the mask [ ,  ]. 


### 2.6. ALFF Calculation 
  
ALFF was calculated using DPARSF software ( ). For a given voxel, the filtered time series was transformed to a frequency domain with a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain the power spectrum. Then the power spectrum was square-rooted and averaged across 0.01–0.08 Hz at each voxel. This averaged square root was taken as the ALFF [ ]. For standardization purposes, the ALFF of each voxel was divided by the global mean ALFF value that was only within the brain and without the background and tissues outside the brain. The standardized ALFF of each voxel should have a value of about 1. This standardization procedure is analogous to that used in PET studies [ ]. 


### 2.7. Statistical Analysis 
  
#### 2.7.1. Functional Connectivity Analysis 
  
To determine brain regions that showed significant positive correlations, one-sample   t  -tests were performed on the individual   z   maps of the PCC/PCu. The statistical threshold was set at   P   < 0.001 and cluster size >6 voxels (AlphaSim corrected). Then, two-sample   t  -tests were used to determine group differences in the functional connectivity with significant correlations within each group. A corrected threshold of   P   < 0.01 and cluster size >18 voxels (AlphaSim corrected) were set to show a significant difference with each group. 


#### 2.7.2. ALFF and ReHo Analysis 
  
One-sample two-sided   t  -tests were performed within each group to show whether the standardized KCC value and ALFF differed from the value of one [ ]. Then, two-sample   t  -tests were performed to see the ReHo and ALFF difference between the subjects before and after alcohol administration and also between subjects with different BrAC. For ALFF analysis, voxels with a   P   value <0.01 and cluster size >10 voxels were considered to show a significant difference between two groups when analyzed using REST software ( ). For ReHo, a   P   value <0.01 and cluster size >25 voxels were used to indicate a significant difference. 




## 3. Results 
  
### 3.1. Effects of Alcohol on the Central and Peripheral Nervous System 
  
Alcohol consumption changed the mood and behavior of the persons tested. Subjects in the low BrAC group complained of headache (  n   = 10), dizziness (  n   = 7), increasing speech (  n   = 9), and feeling tired (  n   = 12). Subjects in the high BrAC group also showed headache (  n   = 14), dizziness (  n   = 13), excitement (  n   = 8), walking unsteadily (  n   = 9), nausea (  n   = 5), and confusion (  n   = 5). 


### 3.2. Functional Connectivity Analysis 
  
The one-sample   t  -test of control group revealed that the intragroup maps of connectivity to PCC/PCu of resting-state network are similar to the DMN. It includes the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, retrosplenial cortex (RspC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and parts of the temporal lobe which comprise the DMN ( ). The decreasing brain regions of connectivity to PCC/PCu of high and low BrAC group were observed prior to alcohol administration. Using the PCC/PCu as a seed for the functional connectivity analysis, we observed significant decreases of connectivity in the bilateral hippocampal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, left superior temporal lobe, left superior frontal gyrus, and left rectus gyrus and increases of connectivity in the left cuneus, left occipital lobe, right superior parietal lobe, right superior frontal gyrus, and right cerebellum in high BrAC group as compared with prior to alcohol administration group ( ). The low BrAC group also showed decreases of connectivity in the left superior and medial frontal lobe, left occipital lobe, left inferior parietal lobe, and right cerebellum and increases of connectivity in the right cuneus ( ). Compared with the low BrAC group, we found that the left rectus gyrus, left cerebellum, right hippocampal gyrus, right superior frontal lobe, bilateral superior temporal lobe, and right fusiform gyrus showed decreases of connectivity and the left medial and superior frontal lobe, right cingulate gyrus, and right cerebellum revealed increases of connectivity in the high BrAC group ( ). 


### 3.3. ALFF and ReHo Analysis 
  
To investigate the ALFF and ReHo difference, a two-sample   t  -test was performed, which showed a significant difference between the two data sets in certain brain areas. Statistical maps of the two-sample   t  -test were created using a combined threshold of   P   < 0.01 and a minimum cluster size of 10 voxels (Tables   and  ) in ALFF and a minimum cluster size of 25 voxels (Tables  ,  , and  ) in ReHo. A lower threshold of   P   < 0.001 was used to see the difference from different BrAC groups in ALFF ( ). Compared with the data obtained prior to alcohol administration, significant positive correlations of the different BrAC groups were observed between ALFF values in the left caudate nucleus, left basal ganglia, left hippocampal gyrus, and left inferior frontal lobe. Negative correlations were also found in the cerebellum, frontal lobe, and temporal lobe. Compared with the low BrAC group, we found a higher ALFF in the right temporal lobe and right parietal lobe and lower ALFF in the bilateral superior frontal lobe (  P   < 0.001, cluster voxels > 10) in the high BrAC group. The higher ReHo values of different BrAC groups in the frontal lobe, cerebellum, right internal capsule, left basal ganglia, left caudate nucleus, left hippocampal gyrus, and left precuneus and lower ReHo values in the frontal lobe, right temporal lobe, right hippocampal gyrus, and left anterior cingulate gyrus (  P   < 0.01, cluster voxels > 25) were found when compared with values obtained prior to alcohol administration. Compared with the low BrAC group, the left midbrain, left middle frontal gyrus, left occipital lobe, right middle temporal lobe, bilateral fusiform gyri, and cerebellum showed a higher ReHo and the bilateral superior frontal lobe, right middle frontal gyrus, right middle and inferior temporal lobe, and cerebellum showed a lower ReHo in the high alcohol group. 



## 4. Discussion 
  
Alcohol leads to dysfunction of cognitive control, causing behavioral disinhibition. The mechanism of alcohol action on brain is still not well understood. Recently, a published study used DTI to detect cytotoxic brain edema after acute effects of alcohol on healthy human brain [ ]. Other studies using fMRI demonstrated disruption in functional network connectivity with alcohol administration during tasks. These studies using independent component analysis (ICA) identified some circuits including the superior, middle, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), primary/supplementary motor areas, frontal-temporal-basal ganglia, cerebellum, and medial prefrontal, inferior parietal, and lateral temporal cortices while driving under the influence of alcohol [ ]. These 5 circuits are significantly affected by relatively high levels (BAC = 0.1%) of alcohol, resulting in both impaired brain function and driving behavior. 

This study investigated the effects of alcohol by detecting the functional connectivity of DMN and using ALFF and ReHo. During a resting state, it may be helpful to further understand abnormalities of brain activity in participants under the acute effect of alcohol, because the absence of demanding cognitive activities and instructions makes it more straightforward to compare brain activity across groups that may differ in motivation or cognitive abilities. To determine which brain regions of healthy person are implicated under the influence of acute alcohol, we examined the acute effects of low (<0.36 mg/L BrAC) and high (>0.36 mg/L BrAC) blood alcohol concentrations. We found that many brain regions showed significant differences in functional connectivity, ReHo, and ALFF between the alcohol administration and before alcohol administration; some other brain regions also showed differences between low and high alcohol administration. From these different analyses, we got some different affected brain regions. ReHo and functional connectivity analyses focus on the similarities of intra- and interregional time series, respectively, and ALFF measures the amplitude of regional activity. 

Previous study examining the brain activation during the fMRI Go/No-Go task suggests decrease in brain activation within the basal ganglia and cerebellum, which comprise parts of networks known to be important for movement and cognition [ ,  ]. The basal ganglia are associated with a variety of functions, including motor control, behaviors learning, cognitive planning, and emotional functions [ ,  ]. The internal capsule is the major route by which the cerebral cortex is connected with the brainstem and spinal cord. The effect on the internal capsule influences the sensory and motor function. The changing ALFF and ReHo in these two regions could affect the control of movement and cognition. Our study showed a higher ReHo of left basal ganglia and right internal capsule in both high and low BrAC group ( ) and a higher ALFF of left basal ganglia in low BrAC group when compared with the control group. But these two regions show no significance when comparing the high BrAC group with the low BrAC group. 

Recently, a study indicated significant decrease in connectivity between the frontal-temporal-basal ganglia and cerebellar components during alcohol condition, which might be a vulnerable point to impair one's order cognitive function and motor planning [ ]. Functional imaging studies of normal subjects have suggested the activation of the cerebellum as part of neural networks responsible for motor planning, working memory, executive and spatial functions, language, and emotional processes [ ,  ]. In this study, the ALFF and ReHo of cerebellum either increased or decreased with alcohol administration. It also showed either increased or decreased functional connectivity in the cerebellum. 

There is another region drawing our attention: it is the hippocampal gyrus. The bilateral hippocampal gyri show difference of functional connectivity, ALFF, and ReHo in both high and low BrAC group. A study using DTI to examine the brain indicated that the frontal lobes, thalamus, and middle cerebellar peduncle are especially vulnerable to the effects of alcohol [ ]. The hippocampal gyri play a very important content of memory function and are a critical component of medial temporal lobe memory system [ ,  ]. Since memory is an important part of individual intelligence, the local connectivity of this region correlates with intelligence. The hippocampal gyrus is commonly linked to target/hazard detection in previous fMRI studies [ ]. 

In the current study, the voxel-based functional connectivity using the PCC/PCu as a seed reveals that the positive correlation brain regions are similar to the DMN. This helps to indicate the PCC/PCu is a central node in the DMN [ ]. ALFF and ReHo changes were found in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and hippocampal gyrus, regions that partly comprise the default mode network (DMN). These changes of functional connectivity, ALFF, and ReHo in resting state suggest how alcohol affected the DMN which is responsible for multiple constituent functions, including action, cognition, emotion, interoception, and perception [ ,  ]. The decreasing functional connectivity of DMN occurs mainly on the left hemisphere, which may suggest that the left hemisphere of brain is more sensitive to alcohol-related damage than the opposite hemisphere under the resting state. This finding is different from the previous study, which might suggest that the right hemisphere is more vulnerable to alcohol-related damage than the left hemisphere using functional MRI during memory encoding tasks [ ]. This finding could also be linked to handedness. 


## 5. Conclusion 
  
Resting-state fMRI could detect brain regions including the superior frontal gyrus, cerebellum, hippocampal gyrus, basal ganglia, and internal capsule which were affected by alcohol. These different brain regions which are related to memory, motor control, cognitive ability, and spatial functions might provide a neural basis for alcohol's effects on behavioral performance.

# Title

The Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation by Implementation Intentions

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
Several studies have investigated the neural basis of effortful emotion regulation (ER) but the neural basis of automatic ER has been less comprehensively explored. The present study investigated the neural basis of automatic ER supported by ‘implementation intentions’. 40 healthy participants underwent fMRI while viewing emotion-eliciting images and used either a previously-taught effortful ER strategy, in the form of a goal intention (e.g., try to take a detached perspective), or a more automatic ER strategy, in the form of an implementation intention (e.g., “If I see something disgusting, then I will think these are just pixels on the screen!”), to regulate their emotional response. Whereas goal intention ER strategies were associated with activation of brain areas previously reported to be involved in effortful ER (including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), ER strategies based on an implementation intention strategy were associated with activation of right inferior frontal gyrus and ventro-parietal cortex, which may reflect the attentional control processes automatically captured by the cue for action contained within the implementation intention. Goal intentions were also associated with less effective modulation of left amygdala, supporting the increased efficacy of ER under implementation intention instructions, which showed coupling of orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala. The findings support previous behavioural studies in suggesting that forming an implementation intention enables people to enact goal-directed responses with less effort and more efficiency.

## Introduction 
  
Emotion regulation (ER) refers to the processes involved in the initiation, maintenance, and modification of the occurrence, intensity, and duration of feeling states [ – ]. ER is, for example, the process by which people overcome feelings of disgust in order to change a baby’s nappy, or overcome sadness to successfully deliver a eulogy. Regulating emotions in this deliberative, effortful manner can be effective in modulating emotional responses, but the effect of regulation on emotional outcomes is relatively modest [ ] and may be associated with cognitive costs [ – ] and physiological resource depletion [ ]. Thus, merely deciding to regulate emotions (i.e., forming a ‘goal intention’) is not necessarily sufficient to ensure effective and sustainable regulation [ ]. 

One way to increase the likelihood that ER goals influence emotional outcomes is to form an implementation intention [ – ]. An implementation intention is an ‘if-then’ plan that links a specified cue (e.g., “If I see blood…”) with a   specific   goal-directed response (e.g., “…then I will look at the situation as if I was a doctor!”). Forming an implementation intention is effective because if-then plans (i) increase the accessibility of the cue specified in the if-part of the plan [ – ] and (ii) forge a strong link between the mental representation of the specified opportunity and the intended response [ – ]. Consequently, there is evidence that merely encountering the cue triggers the intended response in an immediate and efficient manner [ – ] without the need for conscious deliberation   in situ  . In short, an implementation intention recruits automatic processes in the service of a controlled strategy—a process known as 'strategic automaticity’ [ ]. 

Schweiger Gallo and colleagues [ ] (Study 1), showed that ER instructions in the form of an implementation intention (e.g., “If I see blood, then I will remain calm and relaxed!”) were more effective at modulating emotional outcomes than were ER instructions framed as a goal intention (“e.g., “I will not get disgusted!”). An EEG study [ ] (Study 3) showed that the implementation intention influenced emotional responses early in the perceptual process (~100ms), which is consistent with the idea that implementation intentions reflect a relatively automatic process drawing on associations between a specified cue (e.g., “If I see blood…”) and a specific goal-directed response. There have now been approximately 30 studies investigating the effects of forming implementation intentions on emotional outcomes. A recent meta-analysis [ ] indicated that forming implementation intentions is effective at modifying emotional outcomes, with a large effect relative to no-regulation instructions (  d   = 0.91) and a medium-sized effect relative to goal intention instructions (  d   = 0.53). 

Despite evidence of the impact of forming implementation intentions on emotional outcomes, no studies to date have used fMRI to investigate the neural underpinnings of ER by implementation intentions. Understanding the neural basis of ER by implementation intentions is important both to understand the similarities and differences between ER by implementation intentions versus goal intentions, and to clarify whether if-then plans engender strategic automatization of ER. Previous research has reported that effortful ER strategies are associated with activation in prefrontal and temporal areas related to cognitive control including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), pre-supplementary motor area (pSMA), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and lateral temporal cortex [ – ]. Such effortful strategies decrease activity in subcortical limbic areas such as the amygdala (for meta-analyses, see [ – ]). Based on evidence that implementation intentions endow ER with features of automaticity (i.e., immediacy, efficiency, and redundancy of conscious intent; see [ ] for a review), and theoretical proposals that automatic regulation of emotion might be supported by medial frontal areas such as orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) [ – ], ER by implementation intentions should show a different pattern of prefrontal recruitment. In particular, increased modulation of the amygdala and limbic system by ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions (such as the medial orbitofrontal cortex [mOFC]) should be observed. 

The mOFC is well-suited to playing a role in automatic emotion regulation via implementation intentions, being a heteromodal association area that unites information from the sensory modalities, interoceptive information from the body, and representations of prior experiences [ ] [ ]. It is involved in associative processes such as classical conditioning and reversal learning [ ], and processing contextually-relevant information [ ]. The mOFC is also part of the brain’s “association system” [ – ] that is thought to use representations of prior experiences to make meaning of current sensations from the body and world [ ] [ ]. As such, it may contribute to the automatic regulation of emotion by helping a person to interpret visual sensations (an image) in light of learned associations (e.g., when I see the picture on screen, I will not react!), thereby reducing the intensity of emotional responding. 

In the only previous study investigating the neural basis of implementation intentions using fMRI (but not involving emotion regulation), Gilbert and colleagues [ ] compared prospective memory instructions that cued the intended response (e.g., “IF the same letter is on both sides, THEN I will press the middle button!”) with self-initiated instructions (goal intentions) that did not link the cue with a particular response (e.g., “IF the same letter is on both sides, THEN I can score 5 points!”). Although both sets of instructions were expressed in a contingent ‘if-then’ structure, Gilbert and colleagues proposed that only the cued instructions forged a direct link between the specified cue and the intended response in the manner associated with implementation intentions. As hypothesised by Gilbert and colleagues, performance on the prospective memory task was better under cued than under self-initiated instructions. Furthermore, performance under cued instructions was associated with increased activation within areas of the rostral prefrontal cortex including mPFC (BA10). Performance under self-initiated instructions, by comparison, was associated with greater activation of lateral BA10. Given that previous studies have associated medial BA 10 with environmentally-driven behaviour, and lateral BA 10 with tasks requiring attention to be diverted toward self-generated information [ – ] Gilbert and colleagues’ findings support the differing demands of cued performance versus self-initiated performance. Moreover, they suggest that the neural basis of ER under implementation intention versus goal intention may be distinct from one another. 

### The Present Research 
  
We used fMRI to investigate the neural basis of ER under implementation intentions versus goal intention instructions. Participants regulated their emotional responses to a series of disgust- or sadness-eliciting images. Prior to the fMRI scan, one-half of the participants were given a goal intention strategy to use, while the other half were given an ER strategy based on implementation intentions. We hypothesized that ER under implementation intentions would be more effective than under goal intentions as indexed by self reported affect. Neurally, we hypothesized that ER under goal intention instructions would recruit areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex, particularly DLPFC. In contrast, we hypothesized that ER under implementation intentions instructions would show a different pattern of prefrontal recruitment, relying more on medial frontal areas such as orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We also hypothesized that the amygdala would show differential activation according to task instructions, given its role in the representation of emotional experiences and perceptions in general (for meta-analyses see [ ] [ ], but especially its decreased activity during successful emotion regulation (for meta-analyses see; [ – ]). Specifically we hypothesized that ER under implementation intentions would be associated with lower activity within the amygdala than ER under goal intentions. Finally, we hypothesized that connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex would vary as a function of implementation intentions versus goal intention instructions. Specifically, we hypothesized that the amygdala would show enhanced connectivity with regions such as DLPFC during ER under goal intentions, whereas ER supported by implementation intentions would show enhanced connectivity of the amygdala with more medial prefrontal regions, such as the OFC. 

Given that emotionally laden images have previously been demonstrated to also impact peripheral physiological responses [ – ] and that voluntary ER to such stimuli has been shown to affect peripheral physiological responses such as the skin conductance response [ ], we also collected skin conductance responses in order to investigate whether the nature of the instruction influenced autonomic responses. It was hypothesized that if ER under implementation intentions was associated with lower affect ratings, that this would also be reflected in concurrent reduced skin conductance responses. 



## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Forty right-handed healthy participants (20 males; mean age = 20; range 18–23 yrs) were recruited from the local student population. Exclusion criteria were any current psychiatric or neurological disorder or contraindication to MR imaging. All participants spoke English as a first language and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. 


### Ethics Statement 
  
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was approved by the University of Sheffield Research Ethics Committee. 


### Pre-scan training 
  
In the 48-hours prior to the scan, participants completed the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ] the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) [ ] and the revised version of the Disgust Sensitivity questionnaire [ ] ( ). These measures were included in order to ensure that participants in the goal intention and implementation intention groups were matched for handedness, trait emotional sensitivity and habitual emotion regulation style. Participants were randomised to either the goal intention or implementation intention group. A practice phase involved viewing three example stimuli to confirm that they understood the task. 
   Baseline characteristics of participants (mean ± SD).        

### Goal intention and implementation intention instructions 
  
Both goal intention and implementation intention groups received two sets of instructions; each to be used in one functional run of the experiment. The first set of instructions told participants in the goal intention group that “When viewing pictures preceded by REAPPRAISE you should adopt a detached and unemotional attitude”. These instructions were based on reappraisal or distancing strategies widely used in previous studies of effortful ER [ – ]. Participants in the implementation intentions group received the further instruction: ""If I see REAPPRAISE, then I will tell myself that ‘these are just pixels on a screen and the picture can't get to me!”. The second instruction told participants in the goal intention group that “Some pictures will be preceded by the word SUPPRESS. When viewing these pictures you should try to stop yourself from getting emotional. In other words, try to suppress any feelings you have when looking at the picture” (similar to the strategy used in [ ]). Participants in the implementation intentions group received the further instruction: “If I see SUPPRESS, then ‘I will block out all bad feelings and just stay cool!'"". Although the two sets of instructions for each condition were labelled as ‘reappraise’ or ‘suppress’, it should be noted that both might be interpreted as strategies traditionally defined as ‘distancing’ oneself from the stimulus in order to achieve emotional control. In this respect the ‘suppress’ instruction does not strictly correspond with the strategy of expressive suppression which involves avoiding any behavioural display of emotion [ ]; suppression here is rather a form of cognitive suppression and relates to the experience rather than the expression of emotion [ ]. Hence, the key difference between the ER instructions received by the two groups was that the implementation intentions instruction specified a cue (which could be quickly and accurately identified), the intended response (hence reducing the need for deliberation about how to respond) and tied the cue and response together in an ‘if-then’ format (thus promoting automatic response initiation). 


### Stimuli 
  
Images were chosen from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) [ ] on the basis of the normative arousal and valence ratings provided by [ ], with the specificity of disgust or sadness selected on the basis of category-specific ratings from [ ]. Disgust and sadness-eliciting images were included in order to not limit the instructions to a single emotion type. Nine neutral stimuli were also selected. Neutral stimuli were included primarily as a means of providing a buffer against the compound effects of repeated presentations of emotional stimuli. Details of the specific stimuli used are in  . The experiment was programmed in Presentation v14.4 (Neurobehavioural Systems, Inc) and stimuli were projected onto a screen that was viewable through a forward-mounted mirror above the MR scanner head coil. 


### Paradigm details 
  
Each 19.5 second trial began with the presentation of the instruction to ‘attend, ‘reappraise’ or ‘suppress’ onscreen for 3 seconds. Participants were told that images preceded by the word ‘attend’ should be viewed naturally, allowing any feelings elicited by the image to occur (based on instructions used by [ – ]). For images preceded by the word ‘reappraise’ or ‘suppress’, participants were instructed to carry out the ER instructions that they had been taught. An image was then presented for 10 seconds, during the first 6-seconds of which the image appeared to advance towards the participant increasing from 80% of screen size to filling the screen. This manipulation was designed to increase the impact of the image and therefore the regulatory requirements [ ]. Following each image, the question “How sad/disgusted did you feel while looking at the image?” appeared on screen for 5 seconds. Participants used the first two fingers of the right hand to press two buttons on a button box to move the cursor on the screen to the desired location on a Likert scale anchored by ‘not at all’ and ‘very much’. Finally, a fixation cross appeared for 1.5 seconds ( ). 
   Events comprising each trial.    
Participants viewed a total of 45 stimuli in each run; 18 stimuli were designed to elicit disgust (9 viewed under instructions to regulate and 9 to attend), 18 stimuli were designed to elicit sadness (9 viewed under the instruction to regulate, and 9 to attend), and there were 9 neutral stimuli (attend only). Within each run, ‘pseudo-blocks’ of regulation type were created whereby participants followed the instruction to regulate or attend on between 2–4 successive trials, in order to increase the ease of using each strategy (i.e., reduce the demands of task switching). The order of stimuli was also pseudo-randomized such that no instruction type (reappraise, suppress or attend) appeared more than four times in succession, and no stimulus category (sad, disgust or neutral) appeared more than three times in succession. 

Each image was only viewed once during each run. Different images were used for the two runs, such that participants viewed 90 images in total over the two runs; images in the two runs were matched for arousal and valence. The images used in each block, and whether an image was viewed under the instruction to regulate or attend, were counterbalanced across participants. The order of runs (reappraise and suppress) was also counter balanced within both groups (implementation intention and goal intention). 


### fMRI data acquisition 
  
During each functional run (lasting 14 minutes and 39 seconds), 293 volumes were obtained at 3T (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems, Best, NL) comprising 32 x 4mm thick contiguous slices (in-plane resolution 1.797x1.797mm) covering the entire cerebrum and cerebellum. A single-shot, gradient-recalled echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence was used: TR = 3 seconds; TE = 35 msecs; FOV = 240mm; in-plane matrix = 128x128mm). A high resolution T1-weighted structural scan was also collected for spatial normalisation (3D gradient echo, MP-RAGE, TR = 10.5ms; TE = 4.8ms; spatial resolution = 0.8mm ). 


### fMRI data preprocessing 
  
fMRI data were analyzed in SPM 8 ( ) implemented in MATLAB 7.1 (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA). Images were motion-corrected, co-registered to each individual’s high-resolution T1-weighted scan, spatially normalised to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) [ ] single subject template using the unified segmentation approach [ ], and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (full-width half-maximum of 8mm). Of the 80 runs collected (40 subjects x 2 runs), 5 were excluded due to excessive head motion (>2mm). Blood-oxygen-level-dependant (BOLD) response was modelled to an event-related wave-form, convolved with a canonical haemodynamic response function and its temporal derivative. Individuals’ movement parameters were included as regressors in the contrast model to control for movement-related artefacts. Our contrast of interest focused on the 13-second period from when participants were first given the instruction to ‘regulate’ or ‘attend’ up to when the image was removed ( ). This 13-second window captured the entire regulation period, based on evidence that implementation intentions have rapid effects following identification of the relevant cue [ ] and that these effects may last as long as the emotion-eliciting stimulus is present. At the level of the individual subject, epochs of ‘regulate’ were contrasted with epochs of ‘attend’. These first-level, fixed effects analyses were then taken forward to a second, group-level, flexible factorial design. Resulting contrasts from this flexible factorial design were examined at a both more conservative (p<0.05, FWE corrected) and more liberal (p<0.001 uncorrected) statistical thresholds. Finding objective and effective thresholds for voxelwise statistics derived from neuroimaging data has been a long-standing and ongoing issue of debate [ ], though it has been suggested that optimal thresholds are lower than corrected for multiple comparison thresholds [ ]. Specifically, we sought to fully investigate the accuracy of our   a priori   hypotheses while mitigating against over-reporting of Type 1 (false positive) results. While it has been reported [ ] that brain-wide correction for multiple comparisons is unduly conservative for novel complex cognitive and affective social neuroscience processes such as were examined in the present study, we do not believe that use of such correction methods is an ‘all or nothing’ issue (i.e. that intermediate height and extent voxel-thresholds may be valuable in exploratory data analyses and suggesting future hypotheses). Hence, we have reported and interpreted activations at an uncorrected statistical threshold only if they were   a priori   hypothesised. We have additionally reported contrast values for relevant contrasts and utilised ROI analyses where appropriate. Co-ordinates for foci of activation were converted from MNI to Talairach by using the ‘mni2tal’ function within MATLAB. 

#### Region of interest analysis 
  
To examine the relationship between the activity within the amygdala and the efficacy of ER, a region of interest analysis was performed using the MarsBaR toolbox within SPM [ ]. A mask of the left amygdala was created using the WFU PickAtlas toolbox [ ], from which mean signal change during ER trials was extracted for each participant. This mean signal change was then correlated with participants’ self-reported reduction in affect during ER trials. 


#### Connectivity analyses 
  
For connectivity analyses, the time course of activation of amygdala from each individual was extracted when viewing all emotional images, (disgust and sad eliciting, but not neutral) regardless of regulation instruction. The search was constrained by a mask of the left amygdala (WFU Pickatlas toolbox within SPM8; [ ]). The maximally activated voxel from this analysis was used as the centre of a 5mm radius sphere from which the first eigenvariate was extracted. 

A psychophysiological interaction (PPI) term was produced by multiplying these amygdala time course vectors with the paradigm vector (regulate +1, attend-1, neutral 0). This PPI term was then re-entered as a regressor at the first level for each individual as an effect of interest, along with the time course and paradigm vectors as effects of no interest. This PPI term allowed examination of how the amygdala connectivity varied as a result of the instruction to regulate via goal intention or implementation intention strategies or attend. These first-level images were taken forward to a second-level, flexible factorial model with factors of subject and condition. From this second level contrast we investigated areas showing enhanced connectivity with the amygdala under the instruction of ‘regulation’ in comparison with ‘attend’. We also examined connectivity differences between goal intention and implementation intention ER-strategy processes. Results for the connectivity analyses are presented at p<.001 (uncorrected), with an extent threshold of 5 voxels. 



### Skin Conductance Response (SCR) 
  
MR-compatible SCR equipment was based on a battery-powered, electrically-isolated, same electrode configuration implementation of a previously published method [ ]. SCRs were sampled at 20 Hz from the medial phalange of the left index and middle fingers, using 8mm diameter Ag / AgCl electrodes. SCR traces were analysed in Ledalab v.3.2.9 [ ] using the Continuous Decomposition Analysis method to distinguish the phasic (driver) information from the underlying tonic sudomotor nerve activity. Raw SCR data were smoothed via convolution with a Hann window to reduce error noise and fitted to a bi-exponential Bateman function. Data were optimised by a conjugated gradient descent algorithm to reduce the error between them and the inbuilt SCR model. These processing steps allowed computation of a stimulus-locked ‘integrated skin conductance response’ (ISCR), a time-integration of the continuous phasic activity for each stimulus. This ISCR therefore represents an unbiased and time-sensitive measure of sympathetic activity in response to each stimulus [ ]. For investigating whether implementation intention and goal intention ER strategies may be associated with different skin conductance response, ISCRs from participants in both groups were averaged across epochs, within-subject, using SPSS v19 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Technical problems meant we were unable to obtain SCR recording from all participants; recording was obtained from a total of 26 participants (13 in each group). 



## Results 
  
### Self-reported affect 
  
A 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA (within-subject factor of regulation condition [regulate or attend]; between-subject factor of instruction type [goal intention or implementation intention]) showed a main effect of regulation condition (‘regulate’ lower than ‘attend’; F(1,36) = 118.1, p<.0001). Implementation intention instructions were associated with larger changes in affect (attend-regulate) than goal intention instructions (mean change = 1.85 and 1.31 respectively;   t  (34) = 1.85,   p   < .05;  ), indicating that implementation intentions were more effective in reducing the intensity of emotional experience than were goal intentions. Both of the strategies were associated with lower affect ratings for the regulate condition compared to the attend condition (implementation intentions;   t  (19) = 7.28, p<.01; goal intentions;   t  (19) = 8.33, p<.01). 
   Mean change in affect ratings (and standard error) as a function of emotion regulation for the two groups.  
A greater mean change in affect rating is indicative of more successful emotion regulation (i.e. a larger reduction in affect ratings for the emotion regulation compared to not regulating emotion). 
  
There was no difference between the reappraise and suppress strategy in reducing self-reported affect (  t  (37) = 1.36, p = .18). There was a significantly greater reduction in affect for the disgust images compared to the sad images (  t  (37) = 5.12, p<.05). 


### Neuroimaging data 
  
#### Conventional analyses.   ER under implementation intention instructions (ERii > attend)  
  
ER under implementation intention instructions contrasted with the attend condition was associated with activations including right middle frontal gyrus (BA10; signal change = 0.43), right inferior frontal gyrus (BA47; signal change = 0.19), right superior temporal gyrus/temporo-parietal junction (BA39; signal change = 0.12), right inferior parietal lobule (BA40; signal change = 0.23), left precentral gyrus (BA6; signal change = 0.15) and left posterior cingulate gyrus (signal change = 0.12)(  and  ; p<0.001 uncorrected; extent threshold = 20 voxels). 
   Areas activated in the contrast implementation intention > attend.           Brain areas more involved in emotion regulation by implementation intentions in comparison to attending to images.  
Data presented at p<.001 uncorrected, extent threshold 20 voxels. 
  

#### ER under goal intention instructions (ERgi > attend) 
  
ER under goal intention instructions compared with the attend condition was associated with activation of areas including bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG; BA8/9; right MFG; signal change = 0.21, left MFG signal change = 0.30) and left superior temporal gyrus/temporo-parietal junction (BA39; signal change = 0.05) ( , p<0.001 uncorrected; extent threshold = 20 voxels). 
   Areas activated in the contrast goal intention > attend.        

#### Direct comparison of ER under implementation intention with ER under goal intention 
  
ER under implementation intention instructions (ERii > attend) compared with ER under goal intention instructions (ERgi > attend) was associated with activations including left precentral gyrus (BA6; signal change = 0.08), precuneus (signal change = 0.12), right superior temporal gyrus (BA39/22; signal change = 0.02), and right inferior parietal lobule (BA40; signal change = 0.13) ( ). 
   Direct comparison of implementation intentions and goal intentions.        
ER under goal intention instructions compared with ER under implementation intention instructions was associated with greater activation of left sub-genual ACC (BA 25; signal change = 0.09), left superior frontal gyrus (BA8; signal change = 0.11), and the left amygdala (signal change = 0.11) ( ). 
   Brain areas showing greater activation under emotion regulation by goal intentions than implementation intentions (both strategies compared with attending to images).  
Data presented at p<.001 uncorrected, extent threshold 20 voxels. 
  
In order to further investigate the role of the left amygdala response we also conducted a region of interest analysis for the contrasts of attend > implementation intentions, and attend > goal intentions. This analysis revealed a greater left amygdala response to attending to the emotional images in comparison to emotion regulation for the implementation intentions group (t = 2.82, p<.01 corrected) but not for the goal intentions group (t = -0.52, p>.05 corrected), supporting the notion that ER by implementation intention was associated with greater down-regulation of left amygdala in comparison to ER under goal intention. 


#### Correlation with behavioural data 
  
Lower self-reported affect during ER corresponded with relatively reduced left amygdala activity (ER > attend) (R =. -344; p = 0.04;  ). That is, more successful ER was associated with a greater reduction in left amygdala activity. When looking the two groups (implementation intentions and goal intention) it was found that this correlation was significant for the implementation intention group (R = -.512, p<.05) but not for the goal intentions group (R = -.316, p = .19), although a Fisher’s Z-transformation showed that the correlation coefficients for the two groups did not differ significantly (z = -0.56, two-tailed p = 0.58). There was no significant correlation found with the right amygdala for both groups together, or the implementation intentions and goal intentions group individually. 
   Correlation between the left amygdala signal during emotion regulation and the reduction in self report affect rating as a result of emotion regulation.  
The greater the reduction in affect rating rating is indicative of more successful emotion regulation (i.e. a larger reduction in affect ratings for the emotion regulation compared to not regulating emotion). 
  


### Functional connectivity analyses 
  
During ER under implementation intention instructions (ERii > attend), the left amygdala showed connectivity with right parahippocampal gyrus (BA38) and orbitofrontal cortex (BA11) ( ). During ER under goal intention instructions (ERgi > attend), the bilateral middle/superior frontal gyrus (BA8), right ACC (BA24), and left putamen showed functional connectivity with the left amygdala ( ).

### Skin conductance response 
  
A 2 x 3 repeated measures ANOVA revealed a main effect of regulation (regulate, attend, or neutral)(F(2,23) = 3.5, p<.05) but no interaction with instruction type (goal intention or implementation intention) (F(2,23) = 1.51, p = .24). A paired samples t-test showed that ISCR was significantly higher when attending to emotional images (mean ISCR = 1.318) compared to when attending to neutral images (mean = 1.06; t(25) = 2.33, p<.05). 



## Discussion 
  
We used fMRI to investigate the neural basis of two emotion regulation (ER) strategies that varied in their inherent automaticity. One half of the participants were instructed to use a general ‘goal intention’ strategy to regulate their emotions, while the other half of the participants used a more specific ‘implementation intention’ strategy. Behavioural and fMRI activation results supported our overarching hypothesis that implementation intentions are an effective means of achieving emotion regulation, which may in part be due to modulation of the amygdala by a relatively automatic process mediated by the orbitofrontal cortex. 

Lower self-report affect among participants who formed an implementation intention compared to those who formed a goal intention supports previous studies suggesting that forming an implementation intention is an effective way to regulate affect [ ][ ]. The increased efficacy of the implementation intention was also supported by the neuroimaging data, which showed that activity in the amygdala was higher during ER under goal intention instructions than under implementation intention instructions (and that amygdala activity was higher in the contrast attend > implementation intention, but not for attend > goal intention). The general role of the amygdala in ER was further supported by a significant correlation between the reduction in amygdala signal during emotion regulation and the reduction in affect for the implementation intention group as well as the goal intention group [ ] [ ] [ ] though we note that this analysis reveals that some participants showed an increase in amygdala activation whereas other participants showed a decrease. One possible explanation for this variability could be the fact that previous studies have shown that the amygdala tends to show an increase in response to the presentation of affective pictures [ – ] and that the signal may only begin to reduce after a delayed period during which the image is not presented. The current study maintained the image on screen throughout the entire regulation period, which may imply that the reduction in amygdala signal was not as great as for when the image is removed from view. It is also interesting within this study that only the left amygdala showed the differential reduction in activation as a function of emotion regulation instruction. Some other studies [ ] [ ] and one meta-analysis [ ] have found similar modulation specifically within left amygdala during regulation of negative material. It is possible that this laterality effect may relate to the notion that the response of left amygdala to emotional stimuli is perhaps greater [ ] or more sustained than that of the right [ – ]. It is also possible that the left amygdala may be more preferentially involved when the nature of the required processing for the emotional stimulus is more linguistic in nature [ ]. However given that many other studies of goal intentions ER, including another recent meta-analysis [ ], have also found an effect within the right as well as left amygdala, it is difficult to precisely account for this laterality effect. Future studies investigating emotion regulation by implementation intentions may be able to more systematically examine any role of the right amygdala by manipulating factors such as the length of presentation of the stimulus, or the linguistic complexity of the implementation intention instruction. 

In line with previous studies of more effortful ER (e.g. [ ] [ ] [ ]; for a meta-analysis, see [ ]) we observed that goal intention instructions activated bilateral DLPFC and left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). These data are consistent with models of voluntary ER which suggest that it involves ‘executive control’ systems related to effortful processes. Indeed, recent findings support the idea that regions such as left DLPFC are involved in effortful executive processing generally, rather than being specific to ER [ – ]. In contrast, ER under implementation intention instructions showed a different pattern of prefrontal recruitment and was associated with activation in a network of right lateralised fronto-parietal regions. ER guided by an implementation intention is therefore dissociable from ER guided by goal intention to the extent that different neural systems are recruited. 

Our hypothesis that amygdala-frontal connectivity would be evident during ER under goal intention instructions was confirmed and is consistent with a number of previous investigations of ER under goal intention instructions [ ] [ ]. Our data therefore provide further support for a model in which the efficacy of voluntary ER is driven by top-down modulation of the amygdala by frontal regions, particularly those involved in cognitive control. No such effect was found for ER under implementation intention instructions. Instead, we found connectivity during ER under implementation intention instructions between amygdala and perirhinal cortex/parahippocampal gyrus, and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Connectivity between the left amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex during ER under implementation intention instructions is noteworthy given the orbitofrontal cortex’s suggested role in automatic ER [ – ] [ ]. Our data, therefore, suggest that some of the effects of ER supported by an implementation intention may be achieved through down-regulation of amygdala activity by the OFC. Other research has also suggested that connectivity between OFC and amygdala is associated with individual differences in ER [ ] and that changes in this OFC-amygdala coupling may be a marker for risk of psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder [ ], anxiety and depression [ ]. 

It is noteworthy that activation of sub-genual anterior cingulate (sgACC; BA25) was found for the contrast of goal intention > implementation intention, given that this region has previously been associated with voluntary emotion regulation [ ]. Activation in this region may therefore reflect the increased cognitive effort required for regulation under a goal intention, given that the appropriate action is not pre-planned in the same way as regulation under an implementation intention. This would support the proposed role of sgACC as a general mediator of ER in the absence of specific instructions towards a particular strategy [ ]. 

Activation of the rIFG during ER under implementation intentions could reflect the involvement of the rIFG in the relevant inhibitory processes involved in emotion regulation such as inhibition of motor [ ] and prepotent responses [ ], emotional distraction [ ], and the sustaining of attention [ ]. However the concurrent increased activity within right ventro-parietal cortex (rvPC) results in a network that is strikingly similar to that observed during paradigms investigating attentional control [ ]. Hampshire and colleagues report that the rIFG and right vPC are part of a network engaged by cues that trigger task-relevant behaviour. An interpretation of this finding, consistent with Hampshire and colleagues’ data, might therefore be that activation within such areas reflects a rapid orienting of attention that is captured by the relevant cue word appearing onscreen. This pattern of rIFG and rvPC activation was not seen during ER under a goal intention, supporting the idea that forming an implementation intention may heighten the accessibility of the cue word [ – ]. 

Taken together, our findings suggest that the automatic nature of ER under implementation intention instructions seems to be driven by the increased salience of the cue word (supported by rIFG), which allows efficient retrieval of the goal-directed response (supported by rvPC) that, in turn, facilitates more automatic regulation of the emotional response (in the amygdala) by systems known to be involved in more automatic ER (e.g., the OFC). 

Activation within the left precentral gyrus during ER under implementation intention instructions was not one of our specific hypotheses. However it is possible that this activation reflects the involvement of the left precentral gyrus in the activation of verbal working memory [ – ]. Given that the right vPC (also activated during ER under implementation intention instructions) has also been implicated in retrieving previously learnt information for use in working memory [ ], the neural substrates of ER under implementation intention instructions might therefore be interpreted in these terms to the extent that participants learn a particular piece of information (the if-then plan) which is then brought ‘online’ once the participant encounters the cue for action. Previous behavioural work has attempted to distinguish implementation intention from prospective memory instructions, and has suggested that implementation intention (but not prospective memory) instructions lead to automatic response initiation [ – ]. 

Although skin conductance response was higher for the emotional stimuli than neutral stimuli, further supporting the self-report data that the emotional stimuli did indeed induce emotional responses in participants, our data suggest that the nature of the ER strategy (goal- or implementation intention) did not modulate the autonomic response. It is possible that the relatively small difference in self-reported affect between the groups would not be reflected in significant SCR differences. Indeed, while we have previously shown a significant difference in ISCR between different categories of stimuli (threat vs. harm, [ ]), we have not yet found differences between ER strategies applied to the same category of stimuli. It is also possible that the skin conductance response may have been influenced, particularly in the implementation intention group, by the salient cue. Indeed, the neural data indicates that the cue for action promoted attentional capture, which may also be reflected in the skin conductance response, which is known to exhibit an ‘orienting response’ to salient stimuli [ – ]. 

### Limitations 
  
One limitation of the current study is that it used only young adult participants. Further studies using older populations are warranted given increasing evidence that the mechanisms of emotion regulation change in older populations [ ] and that the nature of self-regulation more generally may be different in older populations [ ]. Such studies could therefore examine whether the benefits of forming an implementation intention for regulating emotion are maintained throughout the lifespan. 

We also acknowledge that we have utilised a relatively liberal height and extent threshold for our fMRI results, which may have led to reporting of some Type I (false positive) errors. The use of a mapwide false discovery rate (FDR) and family-wise error (FWE) of p<0.05 can be unduly conservative for novel complex cognitive and affective social neuroscience processes as were examined in this study [ ]. We have therefore reported corrected results where possible and incorporated percent signal change values into our results. In light of reporting results from various analyses, we have exerted considerable caution to avoid over-interpretation of results, but hope that we have found a balance, such that the more tentative findings from this initial fMRI study of implementation intentions are reported so that they might feed into future hypotheses. Specifically, to address issues of power, a future study might consider using our specific imaging parameters (e.g. image matrix size, mask, voxel dimensions, and smoothing kernel) to conduct a (  post-hoc  ) power analysis [ ]. Finally, in the present study we have modelled the complex, and possibly temporally-variant process of ER as a single 13-second epoch, but acknowledge that in some regions of the brain, more transient responses may also be present. A future study might therefore consider whether an analysis modelling shorter duration events would reveal additional activations of interest. It is also worth noting that although the use of 19.5s trial length and TR = 3s constituted an ‘offset TR’ method of jittering, additional jittering of the length of the inter-trial interval (ITI) may have also led to a better characterisation of the shape of the hemodynamic response function [ – ]. 


### Conclusion 
  
The present research demonstrates that ER supported by an implementation intention is associated with dissociable neural activations compared with ER under goal intention instructions. The effect of forming an implementation intention seems to be driven by processes involved in attentional control and may support more efficient regulation of areas such as the amygdala, by areas involved in automatic ER, such as OFC.

# Title

Hippocampus Is Place of Interaction between Unconscious and Conscious Memories

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
Recent evidence suggests that humans can form and later retrieve new semantic relations unconsciously by way of hippocampus—the key structure also recruited for conscious relational (episodic) memory. If the hippocampus subserves both conscious and unconscious relational encoding/retrieval, one would expect the hippocampus to be place of unconscious-conscious interactions during memory retrieval. We tested this hypothesis in an fMRI experiment probing the interaction between the unconscious and conscious retrieval of face-associated information. For the establishment of unconscious relational memories, we presented subliminal (masked) combinations of unfamiliar faces and written occupations (“actor” or “politician”). At test, we presented the former subliminal faces, but now supraliminally, as cues for the reactivation of the unconsciously associated occupations. We hypothesized that unconscious reactivation of the associated occupation—actor or politician—would facilitate or inhibit the subsequent conscious retrieval of a celebrity’s occupation, which was also actor or politician. Depending on whether the reactivated unconscious occupation was congruent or incongruent to the celebrity’s occupation, we expected either quicker or delayed conscious retrieval process. Conscious retrieval was quicker in the congruent relative to a neutral baseline condition but not delayed in the incongruent condition. fMRI data collected during subliminal face-occupation encoding confirmed previous evidence that the hippocampus was interacting with neocortical storage sites of semantic knowledge to support relational encoding. fMRI data collected at test revealed that the facilitated conscious retrieval was paralleled by deactivations in the hippocampus and neocortical storage sites of semantic knowledge. We assume that the unconscious reactivation has pre-activated overlapping relational representations in the hippocampus reducing the neural effort for conscious retrieval. This finding supports the notion of synergistic interactions between conscious and unconscious relational memories in a common, cohesive hippocampal-neocortical memory space.

## Introduction 
  
Episodic memory is a class of declarative memory thought to depend on consciousness of encoding and retrieval [ – ]. The hippocampus is the neuroanatomical hub governing the encoding and retrieval of episodic memories. Damage to the hippocampal-anterior thalamic axis produces severe impairments of episodic memory, but leaves unconscious forms of memory such as skill-learning or priming intact because these forms of memory depend on extrahippocampal structures [ – ]. 

Recent evidence suggests, however, that episodic memory formation and retrieval is possible even without conscious awareness of encoding and retrieval, and that both encoding and retrieval depend on the hippocampal-anterior thalamic axis [ ]. These findings question classic notions of separate memory systems [ – ] and support the processing-based memory model [ ] that distinguishes memory systems based on processing modes rather than consciousness. The processing-based memory model distinguishes between memory systems with respect to 3 variables: speed of encoding (rapid versus slow), nature of representation (flexible versus rigid), and memory content (single items versus associations). This model hypothesizes the existence of both a conscious and unconscious form of episodic memory with both forms depending on the hippocampal anterior-thalamic axis. Consciousness, therefore, is not prerequisite for relational encoding and retrieval but rather an independent factor that serves the strengthening of hippocampal memory representations [ ]. 

If episodes can be encoded with and without consciousness by way of the hippocampal anterior-thalamic axis and related cortices [ – ], the organization of consciously and unconsciously acquired information in a single, cohesive hippocampal memory space is economically and evolutionarily sensible. Linked episodic knowledge—conscious and unconscious—informs and guides us better through life than episodic knowledge that is stored separated according to levels of representation from conscious to unconscious. Episodic memories are dynamic and subject to transformation from conscious to unconscious and vice versa. Consider an unconscious memory trace that suddenly “pops” into consciousness, or implicit knowledge of a hidden sequence in a serial reaction time task [ ], or a rule in the number reduction task [ , ] that become consciously accessible following sleep. Conversely, memory traces can also get purged from conscious access dropping to a pre-conscious representation [ ]. Consciously encoded memories can also become inaccessible when one is instructed to forget them [ ]. In all of these cases, a cohesive memory space provides for a stable organizational structure of memory that allows for shifts in the level of representation from unconscious to conscious and vice versa. Such representational shifts appear more difficult if one assumes a strict division between memory systems based on conscious access. 

If conscious and unconscious episodic memories are both accommodated by the hippocampal memory system, they can be expected to interact both synergistically and competitively. For example, the activation of   unconscious   memories may facilitate the subsequent formation and retrieval of content-congruent   conscious   memories through activation of nearby or overlapping neural assemblies. We tested this hypothesis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In particular, the hippocampus was hypothesized to be place of interactions between unconscious and conscious retrieval processes. 

Participants were first presented with subliminal combinations of unfamiliar faces and occupations (face plus the label “actor” or face plus the label “politician”) for unconscious relational encoding. Due to the relational nature of unconscious memory formation, we expected the hippocampus to be activated during unconscious encoding. Following the subliminal presentation of face-occupation combinations, an unconscious-conscious retrieval interaction test was given. We studied whether the unconscious reactivation of the earlier formed face-occupation association would facilitate or inhibit the conscious retrieval of a stored association between a celebrity’s face and his occupation, namely actor or politician. We used portraits of famous actors and politicians as cues for the conscious retrieval of occupations. This relational retrieval draws on both the episodic and the semantic (facts) memory system depending on the experience that the young participants in our study had with movies and political shows/news [ ]. Each test trial included the brief but visible presentation of a former subliminal face, stripped off its occupation label, followed by the presentation of the portrait of a celebrity. Participants were instructed to react to the famous face by deciding whether the depicted person was an actor or a politician ( ). 
   Experimental design.  
 A:   Attention task during subliminal encoding. Participants saw a flickering stream of black-and-white pixel masks. Subliminal stimuli were presented between masks. The top left depicts one encoding trial containing twelve repetitions of one subliminal stimulus. Four encoding trials constitute a condition block in this fMRI design. On the top right, a section of an encoding trial is highlighted with indicated presentation durations. To the lower left, the used fixation screens are displayed with their respective frequencies of appearance. Each encoding trial contained one response slide (either a vertical or horizontal line segment). To the lower right, we display the three stimulus categories that belong to the three experimental encoding conditions (from left to right):   Face-Occupation Pairs   for associative encoding,   Faces Alone   for single item encoding (non-associative baseline) and   Contour   for a non-encoding baseline (not discussed in this paper). Portraits belong to the FERET database   [ ]  .   B:   Unconscious-conscious retrieval interaction with indicated presentation durations. A former subliminal face is briefly presented to cue the unconscious reactivation of previously formed face-occupation association. Next, a portrait of a celebrity comes up for the conscious retrieval of the celebrity’s occupation (actor or politician) Participants were required to recognise the famous person and to indicate his occupation by button press. Each condition block contained four trials.   illustrates a trial of the associative retrieval condition   Incongruent   and a trial of the   Old Faces   baseline condition, where no unconscious-conscious interaction was possible. Celebrities’ portraits were taken from Wikimedia Commons ( ). Berlusconi: public domain; DiCaprio: Siebbi ( ). 
  
We expected that the former subliminal face’s occupation (actor or politician) would be reactivated unconsciously and would facilitate or inhibit the conscious retrieval of the celebrity’s occupation (actor or politician) depending on whether the two faces share occupations or not. A facilitating interaction may render the conscious retrieval more efficient reducing neural activation and reaction times. Conversely, an inhibitory interaction may increase neural activation and reaction times. These two conditions were contrasted to a baseline condition that provided for unconscious face encoding and retrieval without relational demands and hence was neutral regarding occupational categorization. 

The hypothesized neural basis of unconscious-conscious interactions comprises the neocortical storage sites of occupations, namely the lateral and polar temporal cortex [ , ], as well as the hippocampal-anterior thalamic axis. Evidence in favour of a common memory space for both unconscious and conscious relational memories would speak to a common memory system for conscious and unconscious relational (i.e., episodic) memories. Such evidence would challenge the traditional segmentation of memory systems according to consciousness [ – ] and would support the processing-based memory model [ ]. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Forty-two healthy male volunteers (age 19–32 years;   M   ±   SD   = 23.86 ± 3.02) participated in the experiment. They denied previous or current neurological or psychiatric disorders and drug abuse. Each participant fulfilled inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria for MRI. All participants were right handed [ ] and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Participants gave semi-informed consent. They were not informed of subliminal presentations until debriefing following the fMRI experiment. This study was approved by the local ethics committee for human studies (Kantonale Ethikkommission Bern). 

Two participants were excluded from data analysis due to their insufficient acquaintance with the famous faces used in the experiment. Seven further participants were excluded because of their above-chance performance on the awareness tests (cf. section 0). Accordingly, thirty-three participants entered data analyses. 


### Material 
  
#### Stimuli 
  
For subliminal encoding, 216 frontal portraits of unknown male faces were retrieved from the internet using Google ( ) and the FERET database [ ]. The portraits were converted to grayscale, realigned and contrast-reduced. They were then validated concerning their prototypicality for the occupations “actor” and “politician” by 32 (separate) students, who agreed to evaluate the faces in an online experiment using a forced-choice task. The 148 least prototypical portraits were used as a stimulus pool for the experiment. Forty-eight portraits were used in the main experiment and the remaining 100 portraits were used in the awareness tests. The assignment of faces to these two lists was randomized for each participant. A contour of a human head was reduced in contrast and blurred to be used in a baseline condition in the subliminal encoding part of the fMRI experiment 

For the test of an unconscious-conscious interaction during retrieval we collected frontal portraits of 32 famous male actors and 32 famous male politicians from the internet. These portraits were also grayscaled and realigned but not contrast-reduced because they were not used for subliminal presentation. 


#### Setup 
  
Stimuli were presented with a Benq© WXGA SP830 DLP video projector using a resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels and a screen refresh rate of 60 Hz. Stimuli were projected onto a backlit screen with a viewing angle of 16° width and 9° height. Stimulus presentation was programmed with the software Presentation Version 11.3 (Neurobehavioral Systems,  ). Participants responded by key press on a Lumina Response Pad LU400-Pair by Cedrus ( ) while lying in the MR Scanner. 



### Experimental procedure 
  
The experiment was carried out in a dimmed MRI chamber. The study encompassed the following phases in this order: 1) a conscious memory task was given to establish a task-set that prepares participants for unconscious associative encoding, 2) the fMRI experiment encompassing subliminal encoding and a test of unconscious-conscious interaction during retrieval, 3) a test of stimulus awareness, and 4) the explicit identification of famous faces. Phases 1 through 3 were carried out while the participants where situated inside the MR scanner. 

The experiment was designed to suit an fMRI block design with alternating condition blocks. There were two fMRI time-series, one for subliminal encoding and the other for the interaction test. All condition blocks took 24 seconds and contained four trials spanning 6 seconds each. The assignment of stimuli to conditions and of occupations to faces was pseudo-randomized. Condition blocks alternated regularly in a fixed order. The starter block varied between participants to distribute over experimental conditions certain psychological dispositions such as stress or fatigue and the pervasive scanner drift. 

#### Subliminal encoding 
  
We used our established presentation protocol with subliminal stimuli embedded in an attention task [ ] ( ). Initially, a fixation cross (F) was presented for 233 ms. Four noise masks (M) were then presented for 183 ms each. Between the noise masks, stimuli (S) were presented subliminally for 17 ms. Stimuli were either   Face-Occupation Pairs  ,   Faces Alone   (= non-associative baseline) or   Contour   (not discussed in this study). The noise masks served as forward- and backward masks [ , ]. One trial took six seconds, consisted of 6 sub-trials and ran down in the following order: 6 × (F-M-S-M-M-S-M). This resulted in 12 consecutive subliminal presentations of a stimulus. In each trial, one of the six fixation crosses was replaced by either a horizontal or a vertical line segment. These replacements had to be acknowledged by participants with key press responses. This attention task ensured that participants’ attention remained focused on the centre of the screen throughout the task. 

Subliminal encoding was implemented as a block design with three alternating conditions, namely   Face-Occupation Pairs  ,   Faces Alone   baseline and   Contour  . Each condition embraced four blocks with four trials each. Hence, we presented 16   Face-Occupation Pairs  , 16   Faces Alone   and 16 times the   Contour  . According to this scheme, 32 of the 48 experimental unfamiliar portraits were presented during the encoding task. The remaining 16 portraits were later used for the unconscious-conscious retrieval interaction test in the   Novel Faces   condition (see next section). 


#### Test of an unconscious-conscious interaction during retrieval 
  
In the test of interaction during retrieval, participants had to categorize celebrities with respect to their occupation—actor or politician ( ). This test encompassed four conditions:   Congruent  ,   Incongruent  ,   Old Face   and   Novel Face  . Each condition embraced four blocks of four trials. Sixty-four portraits of famous actors and politicians were presented as targets. The presentation of a portrait was preceded by the brief but clearly visible presentation of one of 48 non-famous faces. Of the 48 non-famous faces, 32 had previously been shown in the subliminal encoding task. The previously presented 16   Face-Occupation Pairs   were assigned to both the   Congruent   and the   Incongruent   condition. The previously presented   Faces Alone   were assigned to the no-interaction baseline condition of   Old Faces  . The remaining 16 faces had not been presented for encoding; they were presented in the condition of   Novel Faces   (not discussed in this paper). The apparent discrepancy between the number of non-famous faces (48: 16 associative old, 16 single old, 16 not presented for encoding) and the number of famous faces (64) is explained by the fact that each of the 16 former subliminal   Face-Occupation Pairs   was used twice, namely once in the congruent condition and once in the incongruent condition. Accordingly, 16 famous faces were preceded by a congruent associative old face, 16 by an incongruent associative old face, 16 by a non-associative old face, and 16 by a new (not previously presented) face. A trial ( ) started with the presentation of a fixation cross for 1300 ms. This was followed by a 200 ms presentation of a non-famous face. Next, a fixation cross appeared again for 500 ms (= cue-target interval). Finally, a famous face was presented for 4000 ms. Participants were asked to indicate as quickly as possible whether the famous face was an actor or a politician. 


#### Test of stimulus awareness 
  
Following the fMRI experiment, participants were asked whether they had noticed something during the attention task that they performed in the first part of the fMRI experiment. When they denied, they were further asked whether they might have perceived faces or words between or within the noise masks. A yes answer led to the exclusion of this participant’s data set. Following this inquiry, all participants were informed of the subliminal presentation paradigm. Next, we administered two objective tests of stimulus awareness. In these tests, participants’ potential awareness of subliminal stimuli was assessed based on their choice behaviour. We first applied a test of face awareness that tested for the awareness of subliminally presented individual faces. Next, we applied a test of occupation awareness that tested for the awareness of subliminally presented faces plus written occupations. Each awareness tests comprised 50 trials. A trial consisted of the 12-fold subliminal presentation of a stimulus (procedure adopted from subliminal encoding in the main experiment) followed by the forced-choice test concerning this stimulus. Hence, unlike the experiment, there was no encoding-test interval. The immediate succession of a subliminal stimulus and its test facilitates the behavioural expression of stimulus awareness. In the test of face awareness, we presented 50 subliminal unfamiliar faces, each followed by the supraliminal side-by-side presentation of the target face plus a distractor face (presentation duration: 5 s). Subjects were asked to indicate which of the two faces had just been presented subliminally. In the test of occupation awareness, half of 50 faces were presented subliminally with the written occupation “actor” and the other half with “politician”. Each subliminal face-occupation pair was followed by a forced-choice test that required participants to choose between the two occupations. Participants were given 5 s to indicate which of the two occupations was just presented subliminally. In both awareness tests, participants received direct test instructions: they were instructed to base their decisions between faces or occupations on their previous conscious perception of shapes or fragments of subliminal stimuli. Direct test instructions such as this are known to be more sensitive to conscious than unconscious perception and memory [ , ], which allows measuring stimulus awareness. On the other hand, indirect retrieval tests such as the one used in the main experiment (evaluating a famous faces), are more sensitive to unconscious processing. If subjects performed above chance (binomial test;   p   <. 2) in either of these two awareness tests, their experimental data were excluded from analysis. 


#### Test of knowledge of celebrities 
  
Because our participants were young and unexperienced, we needed to ensure that they knew the politicians and actors used in the second part of the fMRI experiment. An interaction between unconscious and conscious retrieval could only occur if participants were able to identify our portraits of celebrities. To this end, participants were instructed at the end of the session to classify the previously used portraits of celebrities according to “politician” and “actor” and to retrieve the celebrities’ names. If participants claimed to know a celebrity but failed to retrieve his name, they described the celebrity and/or where they knew them from to prove identification. All participants but two were able to identify the celebrities. The experimental data of those two participants who failed were excluded from analysis. 



### MRI data acquisition 
  
Anatomical and functional images were acquired with a 3T Siemens Magnetom Trio whole-body scanner. Anatomical T1-weighted image acquisition followed a 3D-gradient echo-sequence with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 × 1 mm  (acquisition matrix = 256 × 256 voxels, 176 sagittal slices; time of repetition (TR) = 7.92 ms; echo time (TE) = 2.48 ms; flip angle (FA) = 16°; field of view (FOV) = 256 × 256 mm ). Structural image acquisition was carried out during the awareness tests. 

Functional T2*-weighted images were acquired using a blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) sensitive, interleaved 2D-gradient echo planar single-shot pulse (EPI) sequence with a spatial resolution of 1.8 × 1.8 × 4 mm  (acquisition matrix = 128 × 128 voxels, 34 transversal slices; TR = 4000 ms; TE = 32 ms; FA = 90°; FOV = 230 × 230 mm ). 


### Behavioral data analysis 
  
Choice reaction times (RT) acquired during the interaction task were analysed with IBM SPSS (version 20). Trials with RT deviating more than 2   SD   from the individual mean were excluded. Because RTs were not normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, all   p   <. 001; skewness > 0), nonparametric statistics were computed (Wilcoxon signed rank exact test). However, parametric testing yielded comparable results. 


### fMRI data analysis 
  
Preprocessing of volumes was carried out with the software SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Volumes were slice-time corrected, realigned to the first volume, coregistered to the anatomical volume, normalized to the MNI T1 template and finally smoothed with an 8 mm (FWHM) isotropic Gaussian kernel. 

First, we computed independent component analyses (ICA) and correlated the extracted components of brain activity with the time-course of the alternations between condition blocks in each of the two fMRI time-series, i.e., the encoding time-series and the interaction time-series. This analysis yields a model-and hypothesis-free estimate of functionally coupled brain areas that were engaged during unconscious associative encoding and retrieval. We computed group-level ICAs using the GIFT toolbox ( ). The optimal number of independent components was estimated according to the minimum description length criteria [ ] in advance of the actual analysis, which was run with the Infomax algorithm [ ]. This procedure resulted in the extraction of 17 independent components for the encoding time-series and 19 independent components for the interaction time-series. We were interested in components reflecting unconscious relational memory processes that covary with the occurrence of associative condition blocks. Independent components were thus sorted with respect to their regression fit with the modelled time course of associative condition blocks. Associative condition blocks contained   Face-Occupation Pairs   at encoding and   Congruent   and   Incongruent Faces   at test. False discovery rate (FDR)-corrected [ ] one-sample t-tests were computed on the β-weights of sorted components to determine whether a component was significantly associated with a time-series. Significant components were subsequently checked for a-priori regions of interest, namely hippocampus and lateral- and polar temporal neocortices. Significant components containing a-priori regions of interest where then tested for a regression fit with their baseline condition (i.e.,   Faces Alone   at encoding;   Old Faces   at test) to ensure that functional coupling of these components was specific for unconscious associative memory processes. Hence, a non-significant regression fit with baseline conditions was expected. Cluster statistics were calculated in SPM8 with a height threshold of   p   = .05 (family-wise-error corrected). Component images were thresholded at   Z   > 2 for visualisation. Labelling and visual inspection of the activation patterns was carried out with xjView8 ( ). 

While ICA is able to uncover global-scale networks, it only allows to plot the strength of association of single voxels with these networks, but is limited in providing insight into how local neural groups relate to behaviour directly. Therefore, we regressed retrieval performance (reaction time differences) onto fMRI contrasts to reveal signal changes that relate linearly to the behavioural evidence of unconscious-conscious retrieval interactions. SPM8 was used for first and second level analyses of contrasts between conditions. In the first level analysis, the time-series of each participant were modelled with a box car function convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. In the second level analysis, group level statistics were computed on first level contrasts using within-subject one-way ANOVAs. We entered the RT-differences recorded at test as a covariate of interest into the second-level GLM. 

For subliminal encoding, the contrast (  Face-Occupation Pairs   >   Faces Alone   baseline) was correlated with the difference in reaction times in the incongruent versus congruent condition. This RT difference was chosen as a regressor over the RT difference of   Old Faces   baseline—  Congruent   because there is no difference between a prospectively congruent and incongruent face at the time of encoding, and because each   Face-Occupation Pair   was used in both the   Incongruent   and the   Congruent   condition. 

For the interaction test, the contrast (  Congruent   >   Old Faces   baseline) was correlated with the difference in reaction times recorded in the   Congruent   versus the   Old Faces   condition. Both this RT measure and the fMRI contrast reflect facilitating interactions between unconscious and conscious associative retrieval. The fMRI data were not analysed regarding interfering interactions (  Incongruent   condition) because the behavioural data (see below) showed no evidence of interference between unconscious and conscious retrieval. No corrections for multiple comparisons were applied due to the small signals associated with unconscious processing [ , , ]. The height threshold was   p   = .001 for the whole brain and   p   = .005 for the hippocampus, which was the a priori key region of interest. The extent threshold was four voxels. Labelling and visual inspection of the activation patterns was carried out with xjView8. 



## Results 
  
### Awareness tests 
  
Participants were oblivious of both the fact of subliminal stimulation and the subliminal stimuli. For the analysis of data obtained in the two objective awareness tests, we took a conservative approach analysing the data of each individual using binomial testing. Participants with a performance above the upper 20%- cut-off of the chance distribution of correct responses were considered potentially aware of subliminal stimuli. Their data acquired in the fMRI experiment were therefore excluded from analysis. The 20%-cut-off corresponded to a hit rate of 56% (50% = chance level). Seven participants performed better than expected by chance either on the face or on the occupation awareness test. The remaining participants performed at chance level as individuals and as a group on both the face awareness test (49 ± 7.3% (  M   ±   SD  ); one-sample   t  -test against 0.5:   t  (32) = -.583,   p   = .564) and the occupation awareness test (49 ± 7.2%;   t  (32) = -.527,   p   = .603). Hence, these remaining participants were unable to consciously detect subliminal faces or words or fragments thereof. 


### Main Experiment: Behavioural performance 
  
#### Subliminal processing and attention task 
  
Participants were simultaneously processing two different streams of information at the unconscious and the conscious level. At the conscious level, participants engaged in the attention task. At the unconscious level, they processed subliminal faces and written occupations. We collected behavioural data on the attention task and calculated accuracy scores. Participants performed the attention task with high accuracy (hit rate = 94 ± 23.7%,   M   ±   SD  ) indicating that they focused gaze at the middle of the screen and paid attention to the masked presentations during the whole stimulation sequence. 


#### Interaction of unconscious with conscious retrieval of occupations 
  
In the critical retrieval interaction test, participants responded to the presentation of portraits of famous actors and politicians by manually indicating their occupational category “actor” versus “politician”. Two participants performed poorly (46.9% and 65.6% correct) because they were not familiar with the celebrities; these two participants were excluded from data analysis. The remaining participants identified celebrities with 91 ± 10% (  M ± SD)   (  Congruent  ), 93 ± 9% (  Incongruent  ) and 92 ± 8% (  Old Faces  ) correct responses. Because accuracy of choice did not differ between conditions (  F  (2,64) = 1.315,   p   = .276), reaction times were the dependent variable that could be modulated by the preceding unconscious retrieval processes. 

A Wilcoxon exact test revealed a significant difference in reaction times between the congruent and the incongruent condition (  Z   = -2.850,   p   = .002, one-tailed, effect size   r   = .50) with faster responses to congruent versus incongruent famous faces. We further investigated whether this effect was due to congruence gains or incongruence costs by comparing the two conditions to the non-associative baseline condition   Old Faces  . This analysis showed that response latencies were significantly shorter to   Congruent   than   Old Faces   (  Z   = -1.689,   p   = .047, one-tailed,   r   = .29). There was no statistical difference between   Incongruent   and   Old Faces   (  Z   = -.777,   p   = .437) ( ). Hence, the above behavioural effect was due to congruence gains rather than incongruence costs. The   M   ±   SD  s of the RTs in the interaction task were: 1279 ± 313 ms (  Congruent  ), 1351 ± 352 ms (  Incongruent  ) and 1337 ± 373 ms (  Old Faces   baseline). In conclusion, unconscious-conscious interactions were only apparent in the   Congruent   condition, where the unconsciously encoded and retrieved occupations were identical with the consciously retrieved occupations.

As all former subliminal faces in the congruent condition were also used in the incongruent condition and vice versa, a bias could arise due to their repeated presentation. This was, however, not the case: Wilcoxon exact tests showed that RTs to famous faces did not differ between the first versus second presentation of face cues in the congruent condition (  Z   = -1.099,   p   = .280, two-tailed) nor the incongruent condition (  Z   = -0.116,   p   = .916, two-tailed). 



### Main Experiment: fMRI data 
  
#### Independent component analyses 
  
We performed an independent component analysis (ICA) on the fMRI data acquired during the encoding fMRI time-series to explore the functional connectivity of brain regions during the subliminal processing of   Face-Occupation Pairs  . The subliminal presentation of   Face-Occupation Pairs   was associated with decreased activity in a number of functionally connected brain areas that constituted one of the obtained components (  r   = -.16,   t  (32) = -3.1,   p   = .004 < FDR critical   p   = .006) (  and  ). This component included bilateral areas in the superior temporal sulcus (extending into superior and middle temporal gyrus) and temporal pole, which harbour storage sites of lexical-semantic information such as occupations [ ]; bilateral hippocampus and ventromedial thalamus, required for encoding of new information [ ]; and bilateral amygdala, which is considered to play an important role in face perception and evaluation. As faces convey highly significant social and emotional information, the amygdala is automatically engaged when faces are perceived [ ]. Importantly, this component did not covary with the   Faces Alone   baseline (  r   = .13,   t  (32) = 0.4,   p   = .69), and the regression-fit of this component with   Face-Occupation Pairs   was significantly better than with   Faces Alone   (  t  (32) = -2.1,   p   = .044, effect size   r   = .35) ( ). In conclusion, we can assume that this component was specifically related to the semantic associative binding of subliminal faces with written occupations.

The regression fit of the component is significantly better with   Face-Occupation Pairs   than with   Faces Alone   (*   p   = .044, effect size   r   = .35). The bar plot shows β-weights of the time course modelled specifically to the associative and the baseline condition. Error bars indicate the SEM.

The negatively (rather than positively) deflected fMRI signal during subliminal relational versus single face encoding calls for an explanation. Such negative deflections are in fact a replicable phenomenon observed during subliminal associative encoding relative to a non-associative baseline [ , , ]. The hippocampus is active whenever an event is experienced [ ] and also during rest because it retrieves and stores memories in the stream of spontaneous conscious mentation [ ]. During subliminal encoding, the hippocampus may split its processing capacity between conscious spontaneous mentation and unconscious encoding of subliminal stimuli. Because backward masks interrupt the firing response of activated neurons [ , ], the processing of subliminal face-occupation pairs gets interrupted by backward masks. The more neurons are recruited to encode subliminal stimuli instead of spontaneous conscious thoughts, the more spiking activity is interrupted in the hippocampus, which reduces the fMRI signal. Relative to a relational condition, where many hippocampal neurons are recruited for unconscious encoding, a non-relational baseline condition frees hippocampal neurons from subliminal processing and makes them available for encoding the stream of spontaneous conscious thoughts. Hence, the firing of more hippocampal neurons is interrupted in the experimental than the baseline condition reducing the fMRI signal. 

We also performed an ICA on the fMRI data acquired during the interaction time-series. This ICA yielded no significant component. Because all experimental conditions included the conscious inspection of famous faces and the conscious retrieval of their occupations—i.e., tasks associated with strong signal changes in the brain—, we suspect that the superimposed signal changes associated with unconscious processes were too weak and sparse for a clear modulation of the global signal. 


#### Correlation of fMRI data with behavioural performance 
  
The reaction time difference   Incongruent  —  Congruent   was regressed onto the subliminal encoding contrast (  Face-Occupation Pairs   >   Faces Alone  ) to reveal brain activation underlying successful unconscious associative encoding ( ). Activity reductions during subliminal associative encoding were related to faster responses at test in the congruent versus incongruent condition. Significant correlations were located in a large area that included the left hippocampus and amygdala (  r   = -.564;  ) corroborating the results of the subliminal encoding ICA, and extending them by linking brain activity at encoding with behavioural facilitation at test. Further inverse correlations were located in the right frontal operculum/insula (BA 44/13) and bilateral lentiform nuclei, i.e., putamen and globus pallidus. Activity in or near these two regions has been shown to be associated with word reading [ ], more consistently within the left, rather than the right hemisphere [ ]. It should be noted that unconscious information processing is often strongly supported by the right hemisphere, especially if the encoded information is emotionally relevant [ ]. Hence, unconsciousness of processing might explain why we found a right hemisphere focus of activation in areas usually displaying left hemisphere dominance. 
   Hippocampal activity relates to retrieval performance.

We also regressed reaction time differences at test onto brain activity underlying the interaction of unconscious with conscious associative retrieval. Because the behavioural data indicated that the unconscious-conscious retrieval interaction yielded only congruence gains, and no incongruence costs, we focussed on congruence effects. The reduction in response time in the   Congruent   versus   Old Face   condition was regressed onto the fMRI contrast (  Congruent   >   Old Faces  ). Significant negative correlations ( ) were located in the right posterior hippocampus (  r   = -.475;  ), the left temporal pole (BA 38) (  r   = -.572), and within the posterior end of the right superior temporal sulcus extending into the angular region (BA 22 & 39) (  r   = -.556). The posterior superior temporal sulcus is a face-responsive region often associated with theory of mind [ , , ], and the temporal poles have been shown to specifically account for person-related semantics such as occupations [ ]. That activity in these areas predicts the magnitude of the congruence effect suggests that these areas supported the unconscious recognition of the former subliminal faces and the unconscious reactivation of associated knowledge (occupations), which could then facilitate the conscious retrieval of the famous individual’s occupations. We will discuss below why this correlation was negative and what its theoretical implications are. 
   Retrieval-related fMRI signal correlates with behavioural facilitation during the interaction test.        



## Discussion 
  
Based on previous evidence that experienced episodes can be encoded with and without consciousness and recruit the hippocampal anterior-thalamic axis and related cortices in both cases [ – ], we hypothesized that consciously and unconsciously acquired relational memories are harboured within a single, cohesive hippocampal-neocortical memory space, where they interact with each other. The reactivation of an unconsciously acquired relational memory facilitated the subsequent conscious retrieval of a semantically congruent relational memory. This facilitation was reflected in shortened reaction times and simultaneously recorded reductions in neural activation within hippocampus and neocortical storage sites thought to harbour lexical-semantic and person identity information. In the following, we discuss potential mechanisms that may underlie this facilitative unconscious-conscious retrieval interaction. 

Our results point to facilitatory unconscious-conscious retrieval interactions in the congruent condition of our fMRI experiment. The supraliminal presentation of a non-famous person, who was previously presented subliminally with an occupation (e.g., politician), led to reduced response times to celebrities that share this occupation (e.g., also politician). The shortening of response times indicates that the celebrities’ occupations were preactivated by the presentation of the former subliminal faces. Accordingly, subliminal face-occupation combinations must have been encoded and stored in the first place. This finding replicates previous demonstrations of the feasibility of subliminal semantic paired-associative encoding and long-term storage using face-occupation combinations [ , , , ] and word pairs [ , – ]. 

Savings in response times in the congruent condition went along with modulations of neural activation within hippocampus, temporal pole, superior temporal sulcus, angular gyrus, and precuneus. These neural effects were probably due to conscious rather than unconscious retrieval processes because signals associated with conscious versus unconscious mental processes are much stronger [ – ]. We suggest two possible mechanisms that may have caused response time and neural savings in the congruent condition ( ). 
   Network model of the assumed unconscious-conscious retrieval interaction.  
We suggest an intrahippocampal interaction mechanism as cause for the congruence effects: the supraliminal presentation of the former subliminal face elicits unconscious face recognition activating the fusiform gyrus. The fusiform signal triggers the hippocampal reactivation of the face-associated occupation (e.g., politician) (  1  ), which in turn activates occupational knowledge (politician) in the lateral temporal lobe (  2  ). The activated hippocampal relational engram coactivates other overlapping engrams; e.g., memories of other politicians. This intra-hippocampal preactivation facilitates the retrieval of a celebrity’s occupation (  3  ). If a portrait of Obama were presented in the congruent condition, hippocampal and lateral temporal activity would be reduced compared to the baseline condition, where a hippocampal ab-initio activation would build up. Incongruence costs are not to be expected because the preceding hippocampal retrieval of a professional with another occupation (actor) would leave non-overlapping politician-related hippocampal memories unaffected. This scenario would support the view that consciously and unconsciously acquired memories are organized in a single, cohesive hippocampal-neocortical memory space with memories organized relative to their contents. Overlapping memories are linked, which supports pattern completion, abstraction and anticipation. 
  
1) Facilitation in the congruent condition may have occurred through conceptual priming of occupational knowledge stored in the lateral temporal lobe. Following the presentation of the former subliminal face and identification through face recognition units in the fusiform face area, the face-associated occupation (e.g., politician) was retrieved through hippocampal processes ( .1.) that in turn activated occupation-relevant storage sites in the lateral temporal lobe ( .2.). This preactivation of occupational knowledge sites in the lateral temporal lobe may then have primed the conscious retrieval of the famous person’s occupation (e.g., politician) reducing net activation in the lateral temporal lobe through repetition suppression due to neural sharpening or facilitation [ , ]. The reduced activation in hippocampus can be explained in terms of a sparse hippocampal recruitment for recovering the preactivated occupation of the famous face. The conceptual preactivation curtailed any unnecessary hippocampal search processes, which were necessary in the baseline condition increasing the hippocampal signal. Because the congruent condition was contrasted with the baseline condition, the activation level was relatively reduced. This mechanistic explanation of the unconscious-conscious interaction is, however, flawed by the absence of an inhibitory unconscious-conscious interaction in the incongruent condition. If conceptual priming was the crucial mechanism, we should have observed negative priming [ ] in the incongruent condition (i.e. slower reactions). Because no incongruence costs occurred in the incongruent condition, conceptual priming is probably not the only mechanism underlying the unconscious-conscious interaction. A further reason why conceptual priming is unlikely to be the only mechanism at work is evidence in amnesic patients that the hippocampus is necessary for the relational encoding and retrieval of subliminal item pairs [ ]. Accordingly, it can be assumed that both neocortex and hippocampus were involved in the unconscious and conscious retrieval of face-occupation associations. 

2) Another mechanism seems therefore more likely, which assumes an intrahippocampal interaction as an additional cause for the congruence effects. According to this scenario, the supraliminal presentation of the former subliminal face elicited unconscious face recognition activating the fusiform gyrus. The fusiform signal triggered the hippocampal reactivation of the face-associated occupation (e.g., politician) ( .1.), which in turn activated occupational knowledge (politician) in the lateral temporal lobe ( .2.). The activated hippocampal relational engram coactivated other overlapping engrams [ ], e.g., memories of other politicians. This intra-hippocampal preactivation facilitated the retrieval of the presented celebrity’s occupation ( .3.). This second scenario is in line with known characteristics of the hippocampal memory system: the hippocampal memory system forms relational networks of memory traces that share aspects. This organizational structure permits an activated memory trace to trigger the activation of memory traces that share aspects and hence overlap [ ]. E.g., the presentation of Obama’s portrait in the congruent condition would be accompanied by reduced activity in the hippocampus and lateral temporal lobe due to the semantic overlap of unconscious and conscious memory traces. The preactivation of the overlapping neural populations in hippocampus during unconscious retrieval allows for a more sparing activation during conscious retrieval. In the baseline condition, no unconscious relational memories are formed that could be reactivated at test. Thus, in the baseline condition the hippocampal search process builds up fully. Incongruence costs are not to be expected because the preceding hippocampal retrieval of, say, an actor would leave non-overlapping politician-related hippocampal memories unaffected. This scenario is analogous to retrieval-induced forgetting, where a partial retrieval of information can impair the subsequent retrieval of the remaining information, if the remembered and forgotten information comes from the same semantic category [ ]. This second scenario is also likely in view of earlier findings of a hippocampal role in unconscious relational encoding/retrieval [ ]. If this interpretation is correct, the finding suggests that consciously and unconsciously acquired memories are organized in a single, cohesive hippocampal-neocortical memory space. There is evidence that memories are organized topologically within the hippocampus relative to their contents, with more closely related engrams represented increasingly overlapping neural populations [ ]. Linked overlapping memories support pattern completion, abstraction and anticipation [ ] and newly encoded information is readily integrated into pre-existing relational networks [ ]. The degree of representation from consciously accessible to inaccessible memories is presumably orthogonal to the content-based organization of hippocampal memories [ ]. 

A synergistic unconscious-conscious interaction may be counterintuitive when considering previous reports of competing interactions between implicit and explicit memories [ , ]. In these earlier studies, however, declarative memory was compared to either procedural memory or priming, managed by hippocampus, basal ganglia and neocortex, respectively. Consequently, competing memory interactions may have occurred because unconscious and conscious learning mechanisms did not share the same memory system. Conversely, the interaction in the current study was harmonious because both unconscious and conscious relational memories were supported by the hippocampus. 

The current study design has its limitations. It does not allow the isolation of neural activity underlying unconscious versus conscious retrieval because the rapid succession (500 ms) of the non-famous face cue for unconscious reactivation and the famous face cue for conscious retrieval results in a blurring of signals. Therefore, we can only speculate about the mechanisms underlying the facilitatory unconscious-conscious interactions. A further limitation is that our portraits of celebrities might tap semantic information [ ] besides episodic memories. Hence, the probed memory system cannot be determined beyond doubt. Yet, during the test of knowledge of celebrities it became clear that our participants were not overly familiar with many of the used famous faces and had to draw on their episodic memory. Furthermore, if semantic person knowledge was sufficient to recall occupations, unconscious-conscious interactions would likely not have modulated hippocampal signals but neocortical signals alone [ ]. 

The classic view of the hippocampal memory system holds that consciousness is required for episodic memory formation [ – ]. However, the unconscious-conscious retrieval interaction reported here suggests that conceptually overlapping unconscious and conscious memories are stored in close association within hippocampus. An intertwined store of consciously accessible and consciously inaccessible relational hippocampal memories is compatible with the processing based memory model [ ]. Also, a single, cohesive hippocampal memory space for any level of representation—unconscious to conscious—is evolutionarily sensible. As pointed out earlier, episodic memories may shift from a conscious to an unconscious representation and vice versa over time [ – ]. In both these cases, a cohesive memory space provides for a stable organizational structure of hippocampal memories. Such representational shifts appear difficult if one assumes a strict division between memory systems based on conscious access. It is more economical to assume one hippocampal memory system that serves one computational goal, namely rapidly establishing new flexible associations, irrespective of conscious access [ ].

Altered Resting-State Functional Connectivity of the Frontal-Striatal Reward System in Social Anxiety Disorder

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
We investigated differences in the intrinsic functional brain organization (functional connectivity) of the human reward system between healthy control participants and patients with social anxiety disorder. Functional connectivity was measured in the resting-state via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 53 patients with social anxiety disorder and 33 healthy control participants underwent a 6-minute resting-state fMRI scan. Functional connectivity of the reward system was analyzed by calculating whole-brain temporal correlations with a bilateral nucleus accumbens seed and a ventromedial prefrontal cortex seed. Patients with social anxiety disorder, relative to the control group, had (1) decreased functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens seed and other regions associated with reward, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex; (2) decreased functional connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex seed and lateral prefrontal regions, including the anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices; and (3) increased functional connectivity between both the nucleus accumbens seed and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex seed with more posterior brain regions, including anterior cingulate cortex. Social anxiety disorder appears to be associated with widespread differences in the functional connectivity of the reward system, including markedly decreased functional connectivity between reward regions and between reward regions and lateral prefrontal cortices, and markedly increased functional connectivity between reward regions and posterior brain regions.

## Introduction 
  
A fundamental goal of neuroscience is to understand the functional organization of brain networks that underlie neuropsychiatric disease. One prevalent disease is social anxiety disorder (SAD) [ ], a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by fear of negative evaluation by others, which in turn leads to high levels of anxiety and avoidance of social situations [ ]. Multiple neuroimaging studies have focused on an increased amygdala response that is associated with social anxiety [ ]. Here we asked whether there are also differences in SAD of the intrinsic functional organization of the reward system of the brain, i.e. brain regions that are activated by the anticipation or receipt of reward [ ,  ]. We measured intrinsic functional organization from resting-state fMRI that identifies neural networks as defined by regions exhibiting correlated, low-frequency fMRI signals in the absence of external stimuli [ ,  ]. 

Animal and human research have converged to identify several brain regions that are consistently activated by reward, including the striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and ventromedial prefrontal cortical (vmPFC)/medial orbitofrontal (mOFC). The ventral striatum and NAcc are associated with reward anticipation [ ,  ], whereas the vmPFC is associated with receipt of reward [ ]. The vmPFC has also been shown to encode the value of reward outcomes in decision-making that requires action [ ]. The vmPFC/mOFC likely plays a role in translating rewards to a representation of value [ ]. We were guided by this literature to select seeds (brain locations) in the NAcc and vmPFC regions, and compare their intrinsic functional connectivity between the SAD and control groups. 

Neuroimaging studies examining task-driven activations have indicated that the reward system is affected in SAD. People with SAD showed increased activation in the amygdala but decreased activation in OFC and vmPFC when anticipating negative emotional stimuli [ ]. SAD patients also showed increased temporal correlations between the amygdala and vmPFC/mOFC compared to healthy participants in resting-state functional connectivity [ ]. Striatal dysfunction also occurs in people with behavioral inhibition, a temperamental trait that is characterized by withdrawal from unfamiliar social situations and that might be a precursor of adult SAD [ – ]. Behaviorally inhibited adolescents have shown altered striatal activation, including in the caudate and NAcc, to anticipated rewards and altered vmPFC activation for reward outcomes [ ,  ]. Deep-brain stimulation of the NAcc was shown to decrease generalized anxiety, showing a causal role for the NAcc in anxiety [ ]. These results point to differences in the reward system between people who are socially anxious or behaviorally inhibited and those who are not. 

Conceptually, it is plausible that SAD is associated with an altered reward circuitry. People typically find social interactions to be rewarding, but SAD patients often find such interactions to be aversive and anxiety provoking. Intrinsic functional connectivity may reflect chronic interactions among brain regions that mold large-scale functional networks. Reduced experience of social reward in SAD may be reflected by altered functional connectivity between the two major components of the reward system, which are also associated with social reward [ ], the NAcc and the vmPFC. Translation of reward into reward value may involve interactions between NAcc and vmPFC, and decreased NAcc-vmPFC connectivity may reflect weakened translation of reward into reward value. We hypothesized that people with SAD would show decreased functional connectivity between the NAcc and the vmPFC. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Patients were recruited from the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston University and the Center for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress Related Disorders at Massachusetts General Hospital. Control participants were recruited via advertisements from the community. Brain scans were performed at the Athinoula A. Martinos Imaging Center at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT. All participants gave written informed consent to all procedures. The procedures were approved by the Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects at MIT, the Institutional Review Board at Boston University, and the Partners Human Research Committee at Massachusetts General Hospital. 

Participants were 53 outpatients with SAD (generalized subtype; years with SAD:   M   = 16.8 years; age of onset:   M   = 13.4 years; age:   M   = 29.9 years; 44 right handed; 17 women) and 33 healthy Control participants (age:   M   = 29.4 years; 29 right handed; 14 women). The two groups did not differ significantly for mean age (Control:   M   = 29.4,   SD   = 6.22; SAD:   M   = 29.9,   SD   = 8.25;   t  (84) = .31,   p   = .76), the proportions of men and women, (χ (1, N = 86) = .94,   p   = .33), or the proportions of right-handed and left-handed individuals (χ (1, N = 86) = .37,   p   = .54). Patient and Control groups did not differ significantly on IQ as estimated with the American National Adult Reading Test Full Scale Intelligence Quotient [ ] (Control:   M   = 118.6,   SD   = 7.22; SAD:   M   = 117.3,   SD   = 6.63,   t  (84) = 87,   p   = .39). 

Patients were off concurrent psychotropic medication for at least two weeks prior to the scanning session. Diagnoses were confirmed with Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV or the Anxiety Interview Schedule for DSM-IV [ ]. The diagnosis and diagnostic subtype specifier was assessed with the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule IV Revised (ADIS-IV-R) by experienced clinicians. The severity of social anxiety was measured using the clinician-administered version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) [ ] with a minimum LSAS score of 60 as an additional inclusion criterion (  M   = 81.85; range: 60–121). 

Exclusion from the study occurred in the case of a lifetime history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, psychosis, delusional disorders or obsessive-compulsive disorder; an eating disorder in the past 6 months; a history of substance or alcohol abuse or dependence (other than nicotine) in the last 6 months and posttraumatic stress disorder within the past 6 months. Entry of patients with other mood or anxiety disorders was permitted if SAD was judged to be the predominant disorder. In addition to the primary diagnosis of SAD, 18 participants also met diagnostic criteria for comorbid major depression disorder and 16 participants for comorbid anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder: n = 12; post traumatic stress disorder: n = 1; specific phobia: n = 7; panic disorder: 3). Both SAD and Control participants were excluded in the case of neurological disorders or serious medical illness. 

No clinically relevant conditions in the Control group were permitted and the absence of these was confirmed prior to study inclusion using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV [ ]. Patients scored significantly worse on both the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI) [ ] (Control:   M   = 36.7,   SD   = 23.76); SAD:   M   = 112.6,   SD   = 22.27),   t  (84) = 14.99,   p   < .0001, two-tailed) and the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [ ] (Control:   M   = 30.0,   SD   = 7.01; SAD:   M   = 54.8,   SD   = 10.51,   t  (83) = 11.97,   p   < .0001, two-tailed). One SAD patient was missing the STAI score and was not included in this t-test. 


### Imaging 
  
#### Acquisition 
  
Data were acquired using a 3-Tesla Siemens Tim Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel phased array whole-head coil. 3D T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) anatomical images (TR = 2530 ms, TE = 3.39 ms, flip angle = 9°, 1 mm slice thickness, 1 mm  in plane resolution) and one 6-minute resting state scan were collected while participants fixated on a cross (T2* weighted gradient echo TR/TE/Flip = 6000ms/30ms/90°, 67 contiguous interleaved oblique slices, voxel size: 2 X 2 X 2). The sequence included prospective acquisition correction (PACE) for head motion [ ]. 



### Data Analysis 
  
#### fMRI Analysis 
  
The functional data were analyzed using SPM8 [ ]. Functional images were preprocessed with realignment for motion correction, slice-time correction, artifact detection and spatial smoothing (8mm full-width-half-maximum Gaussian kernel). To address any spurious correlations in resting-state networks caused by head motion, we used the Artifact Detection Tools (ART,  ) to identify problematic time points during the scan. Specifically, an image was defined as an artifactual time point if the head displacement in X, Y, or Z direction was greater than .5 mm from the previous frame, or if the global mean intensity in the image was greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean image intensity for the entire resting scan. A two-sample t-test was performed using the number of artifactual time points to compare the difference in motion between the Control group and the SAD group. 

CompCor was used to estimate physiological and other sources of noise [ ]. Global signal regression was not used because it has been shown to bias and produce spurious negative correlations [ ,  ]. Anatomical volumes were segmented into grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) areas and the resulting masks were eroded (one voxel erosion) to minimize partial volume effects. The temporal time series characterizing the estimated subject motion (3 rotation and 3 translation parameters, plus another 6 parameters representing their first-order temporal derivatives) and artifactual covariates (one covariate per artifactual time point consisting of 0’s everywhere and a “1” for the artifactual time point), as well as the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series within the subject-specific white matter mask (3 first principal components) and CSF mask (3 first principal components), were used as temporal covariates and removed from the BOLD functional data using linear regression, and the resulting residual BOLD time series were band-pass filtered (0.008Hz < f < 0.083Hz). 

NAcc and vmPFC were   a priori   regions of interest (ROI) to be used as seeds in the functional connectivity analysis. The seeds were selected from prior reward activation studies (and thus independent of group differences in the present study). In order to minimize the number of statistical comparison, the NAcc (left and right NAcc) and vmPFC seeds (three locations) respectively, were combined into two analyses. Two 5mm-radius ROIs, one on the left and one on the right, from the center of activation in the NAcc regions (MNI: (-8,12,1), (11,11,1);  ) were selected from areas that showed increased activation to reward anticipation from Knutson   et al  . [ ]. Three 10mm-radius ROIs from the center of activation in the vmPFC (MNI: (-6,24,-21), (6,30,-9), (9,27,-12)) were selected from areas that showed increased activation to reward value from Gläscher   et al  . [ ]. The NAcc seeds were smaller in volume because the NAcc is considerably smaller in volume than the vmPFC. 
   Nucleus Accumbens Seed.  
Bilateral nucleus accumbens seed used in resting-state functional connectivity analysis. MNI coordinates: (-8,12,1), (11,11,1). 
  
The left and right NAcc ROIs both showed increased activation to reward anticipation simultaneously in the same study [ ] and therefore were combined to create one NAcc seed (  and   Figs for analysis of separate ROIs). Similarly, the three vmPFC ROIs showed activation to reward value simultaneously in the same study [ ] and therefore were combined to create one vmPFC seed (  and   Figs for analysis of separate ROIs). Consistent with activation literature, both the individual NAcc locations and the individual vmPFC locations exhibited similar patterns of functional connectivity and similar alterations in the SAD group, which supported the validity of combining the individual locations into two seeds. 

First-level correlation maps were produced by extracting the mean BOLD time course from each seed and computing Pearson’s correlation coefficients between that time course and the time course of all other voxels. Correlation coefficients were converted to normally distributed Z-scores using the Fisher transformation to allow for second-level General Linear Model analysis. Two sample t-tests were performed on the Fisher transformed r-maps to examine the differences in resting state functional connectivity between Control and Patient groups. One set of t-tests examined differences for the bilateral NAcc seeds combined into a single network, and the other set of t-tests examined differences for the three vmPFC seeds combined into a single network. All results were reported using a cluster-wise false discovery rate (Cluster-wise FDR corrected) threshold of .05 for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed in the volume and the results were projected to an inflated cortical surface for visualization. 




## Results 
  
To ensure that results were not due to motion artifacts, we compared the number of artifactual time points in the SAD and Control groups. There was no significant difference between groups in the number of artifactual time points (p = .35). 

### Nucleus Accumbens Seed 
  
#### Contrast: Control group > SAD group 
  
The SAD group exhibited significant and widespread decreases in functional correlations (connectivity), compared to the Control group, between the NAcc seed ( ) and multiple regions associated with reward, value, and decision-making, including vmPFC/BA11, bilateral medial anterior prefrontal cortex/BA10, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, anterior regions of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), subgenual ACC, left temporal pole, left hippocampus, and bilateral putamen (Figs   &  ;  ). The region of maximal difference was a cluster that included the vmPFC, and in this cluster the Control group exhibited a significantly positive correlation, but the SAD group did not exhibit any significant correlation (Figs  ,   &  ).

     Regions of Significant Differences in Functional Connectivity Between SAD and Control Groups.        
To ensure that group differences were not the result of lower signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the vmPFC/mOFC cortex in the SAD group, we calculated the temporal SNR separately for the vmPFC cluster for each group. The SAD group had a higher temporal SNR in the vmPFC cluster (Control:   M   = 141.95,   SD   = 32.85; SAD:   M   = 160.81,   SD   = 46.73;   p   < .046, two-tailed). Therefore, increased functional connectivity in the Control group compared to the SAD group was not due to loss of signal in the SAD group. 


#### Contrast: SAD group > Control group 
  
The SAD group exhibited significant increases in connectivity, compared to the Control group, between the NAcc seed and more posterior regions including bilateral somatosensory association cortex, bilateral premotor cortex, bilateral primary motor cortex, and posterior ventral ACC (vACC) ( ;  ). The group differences reflected a pattern of negative correlations (anticorrelations) between the NAcc seed and these posterior regions in the Control group versus a pattern of positive correlations between the NAcc seed and these regions in the SAD group ( ).

### Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex Seed 
  
#### Contrast: Control group > SAD group 
  
The SAD group also exhibited significant and widespread decreases in connectivity, compared to the Control group, between the vmPFC seed ( ) and regions associated with reward, decision-making, and planning, including bilateral NAcc, bilateral medial anterior PFC/BA10, bilateral DLPFC, bilateral inferior PFC, vACC, subgenual ACC, and dACC (Figs   &  ;  ). Both groups exhibited positive correlations between the vmPFC seed and the other regions, but the correlations were significantly greater in the Control group. The region of maximal difference included the NAcc and regions associated with cognitive control, the lateral PFC. In this cluster, both the Control and SAD groups exhibited significantly positive correlations (Figs  ,  , &  ).

#### Contrast: SAD group > Control group 
  
The SAD group exhibited significant increases in connectivity, compared to the Control group, between the vmPFC seed and multiple brain regions, including bilateral premotor, bilateral primary motor cortex, posterior vACC, dorsal PCC (dPCC), and bilateral somatosensory association cortex (cluster 1); bilateral somatosensory association cortex, dPCC, bilateral secondary visual cortex/BA18, and bilateral associative visual cortex/BA19 (cluster 2); and also left fusiform gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus, and left associative visual cortex (cluster 3) ( ;  ). The group differences reflected a pattern of negative correlations (anticorrelations) between the vmPFC seeds and these regions (all three clusters) in the Control group versus a pattern of either positive correlation in the SAD group (cluster 1 and 2, including posterior vACC; Fig   &  ) or the absence of significant correlation in the SAD group (cluster 3;  ). There were no significant correlations within the SAD group between functional connectivity measures and clinical measures (LSAS, SPAI, and STAI).

## Discussion 
  
People with SAD exhibited widespread alterations of the intrinsic functional brain organization of the reward system. Positive temporal correlations between two major components of the reward system, the NAcc and the ventral region of the vmPFC, were significantly reduced in the SAD group. Functional connectivity between both the NAcc and the vmPFC seed regions with multiple other anterior brain regions were significantly reduced in SAD, including prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions associated with decision-making. Conversely, the SAD group showed significantly increased functional connectivity between both the NAcc and the vmPFC seed regions with multiple posterior brain regions, including posterior ACC and posterior parietal association cortex. In these posterior regions, the Control group exhibited significant negative correlations (anticorrelations) with NAcc and vmPFC, whereas the SAD group exhibited either a reversal with a positive correlation or the absence of a correlation. Thus, the SAD group exhibited markedly decreased functional connectivity both between reward regions and also between reward regions and lateral prefrontal cortex, and markedly increased functional connectivity between reward regions and more posterior brain regions. 

The SAD group showed greatly reduced functional connectivity within major components of the reward system, namely the NAcc and the vmPFC. The NAcc is associated with reward anticipation [ , ] and the vmPFC is associated with encoding the value of reward [ ]. If social interaction is typically a source of substantial reward, then the absence of such reward due to chronic fear and anxiety about social interaction in SAD may diminish the frequency of interactions among these components of the reward system. Alternatively, this reduced functional connectivity among these components of the reward system may result in people with SAD seeking less social interaction. The core reward system was also significantly less correlated in the SAD group with other brain regions implicated in decision-making and cognitive control that often interact with reward regions. These regions included bilateral DLPFC, bilateral lateral anterior prefrontal cortex/BA10, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, and anterior regions of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and subgenual ACC. 

Whereas functional connectivity was decreased within the reward system and between the reward system and anterior brain regions, functional connectivity was increased in the SAD group between the reward regions and multiple posterior brain regions. There were also contrasting patterns in the group differences in anterior and posterior regions. In anterior regions, the SAD group exhibited positive correlations between reward regions, but these correlations were significantly less than in the Control group. In posterior regions, the Control group exhibited negative correlations with reward regions, whereas the SAD group exhibited either a positive correlation or the absence of a correlation; in both cases the SAD group exhibited significantly greater correlations relative to the Control group. 

More specifically, the SAD group exhibited a positive correlation (and not the negative correlation of the Control group), between both the NAcc and the vmPFC and posterior regions including the posterior regions of the ACC and posterior parietal cortex. The findings in the Control group were consistent with a previous report of anticorrelated networks between the posterior ACC and both the striatum and vmPFC [ ]. Posterior ACC has been shown to be involved in reward-related decisions, becoming more activated as punishment increased [ ] or during decisions that involve minimizing punishment [ ]. The hyperconnectivity and lack of anticorrelations between reward regions and posterior ACC may reflect changes in the network due to the experience of avoiding social punishment and evaluation. Again, an alternative is that this hyperconnectivity may result in seeking less social interaction to avoid social punishment and evaluation. This, together with the decreased connectivity between the NAcc and vmPFC, may reflect an altered reward network in which reward prediction regions are less correlated with value encoding regions, and both of these reward regions are more correlated with regions that involve punishment. This may help explain how altered brain networks contribute to socially avoidant behavior in people with SAD. 

Previous neuroimaging studies in SAD have found reduced structural connectivity (white-matter organization) and resting-state functional connectivity between subcortical regions and orbitofrontal cortex [ – ]. The reduced relations between prefrontal and subcortical regions, such as the amygdala, could reflect decreased prefrontal regulation of subcortical regions [ ]. The present findings of reduced functional connectivity between prefrontal and subcortical reward-related regions also suggest reduced regulation of social reward. 

There are both psychological and technical limitations of the present study. For the SAD group, the social interactions with researchers involved in performing the imaging may have influenced the nature of thought processes reflected in the connectivity measures. Also, there were no significant correlations between measures of SAD severity (LSAS, SPAI, STAI) and functional connectivity measures. Future research could explore the relation of reduced functional connectivity between the NAcc and vmPFC in SAD patients with tasks that involve social reward. A technical limitation of the study is that we acquired data with a relatively long time of repetition (TR = 6 seconds). We used the 6 second TR in order to achieve high spatial resolution with whole-brain coverage because previous research has demonstrated that array coils provide the biggest increases in temporal SNR at high spatial resolutions [ ]. Although this TR is unusually long, there is evidence that there are no significant differences in the correlation strengths between the resting state networks when comparing TRs of 2.5 s and 5 s [ ]. Furthermore, the correlations observed in the Control group were similar to prior studies using more conventional shorter TRs [ ,  ]. 

We investigated the intrinsic functional connectivity of the human reward system in people with social anxiety disorder. People with SAD had decreased functional connectivity between the NAcc seed, which encodes reward anticipation, and the vmPFC, which encodes reward value. People with SAD also had decreased functional connectivity between the vmPFC seed and the lateral anterior prefrontal cortex and the DLPFC, which are associated with decision making. The SAD group also did not have the typical anticorrelations between both the NAcc seed and the vmPFC seed with the posterior ACC, a region that is associated with punishment [ ]. The observation that independent analyses of NAcc and vmPFC seeds yielded similar differences in connectivity between the SAD and Control groups suggests that there is a widespread difference in reward-network functional connectivity in SAD, spanning regions involved in both reward anticipation and reward receipt and valuation.

# Abstract
 
Higher species commonly learn novel behaviors by evaluating retrospectively whether actions have yielded desirable outcomes. By relying on explicit behavioral instructions, only humans can use an acquisition shortcut that prospectively specifies how to yield intended outcomes under the appropriate stimulus conditions. A recent and largely unexplored hypothesis suggests that striatal areas interact with lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) when novel behaviors are learned via explicit instruction, and that regional subspecialization exists for the integration of differential response–outcome contingencies into the current task model. Behaviorally, outcome integration during instruction-based learning has been linked to functionally distinct performance indices. This includes (1) compatibility effects, measured in a postlearning test procedure probing the encoding strength of outcome–response (O–R) associations, and (2) increasing response slowing across learning, putatively indicating active usage of O–R associations for the online control of goal-directed action. In the present fMRI study, we examined correlations between these behavioral indices and the dynamics of fronto-striatal couplings in order to mutually constrain and refine the interpretation of neural and behavioral measures in terms of separable subprocesses during outcome integration. We found that O–R encoding strength correlated with LPFC–putamen coupling, suggesting that the putamen is relevant for the formation of both S–R habits and habit-like O–R associations. By contrast, response slowing as a putative index of active usage of O–R associations correlated with LPFC–caudate coupling. This finding highlights the relevance of the caudate for the online control of goal-directed action also under instruction-based learning conditions, and in turn clarifies the functional relevance of the behavioral slowing effect.

Higher animals, including humans, commonly learn novel behaviors via trial and error, by evaluating retrospectively whether an action performed under certain stimulus conditions yielded desirable outcomes. However, only humans are able to cut short this acquisition process by relying on explicit behavioral instructions that specify prospectively how to yield an intended outcome. This enables humans to directly yield the intended outcomes while circumventing potentially harmful trial-and-error learning (Doll, Jacobs, Sanfey, & Frank,  ). Although the great importance of this issue was acknowledged early on (Duncan, Emslie, Williams, Johnson, & Freer,  ; Luria,  ; Monsell,  ; Noelle,  ), the underlying mechanisms have still been little explored (Cole, Laurent, & Stocco,  ; Wolfensteller & Ruge,  ). Ultimately, learning by feedback and learning by instruction both enable the expression of goal-directed action by integrating anticipated response outcomes already during action selection. As a prerequisite, organisms need to learn that a certain outcome O is obtained by a certain response R (response–outcome contingency) under the appropriate stimulus conditions (S). 

## Fronto-striatal interactions during instruction-based learning 
  
Under feedback-driven trial-and-error learning conditions, it is widely believed that distinct striatal substructures are important for establishing either outcome-directed (i.e., goal-directed) action relying on the anterior caudate or habit-like (i.e., directly stimulus-triggered) action relying on the putamen (Ashby, Turner, & Horvitz,  ; Dolan & Dayan,  ; Seger & Spiering,  ; Yin & Knowlton,  ). The picture gains complexity when considering that the striatum is not operating in isolation. Neuro-anatomically, it is clear that the striatum is heavily interconnected with the prefrontal cortex (PFC; Alexander, DeLong, & Strick,  ). Hence, one might expect that both areas engage interactively when learning and behavior is “model-based” rather than “model-free” in the sense that it is driven by explicit knowledge of contingencies stored in lateral PFC (LPFC) working memory (cf. Dolan & Dayan,  ; Glascher, Daw, Dayan, & O’Doherty,  ). This view has recently been expressed in a few formal models on instruction-based control of learning and behavior (Doll et al.,  ; Huang, Hazy, Herd, & O’Reilly,  ; Ramamoorthy & Verguts,  ). Moreover, recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that LPFC and striatal areas become functionally coupled when learning is under the control of explicitly instructed rules (Li, Delgado, & Phelps,  ; Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ). Such findings support the notion that model-based learning and model-free feedback-driven learning might share the same striatal machinery (cf. Daw, Gershman, Seymour, Dayan, & Dolan,  ; Doll, Simon, & Daw,  ). Furthermore, first evidence also suggests a similar striatal functional differentiation in that learning-related dynamics of LPFC–anterior caudate coupling, but not LPFC–putamen coupling, is sensitive to the manipulation of response–outcome contingency during instructed stimulus–response learning (Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ). Hence, specifically LPFC–anterior caudate coupling seems to reflect processes linked to the integration of response–outcome contingencies into an explicit model of the current task. 

The primary aim of the present study was to further refine the functional interpretation of this basic finding regarding LPFC–caudate coupling by interrelating functional connectivity measures with two distinct performance measures that have been identified in behavioral studies and might reflect distinct subprocesses of outcome integration during stimulus-based response selection. 

In particular, it is commonly thought that goal-directed action selection is enabled by integrating outcomes via an S–O → O–R activation chain, both according to ideomotor theory and instrumental learning theory (Balleine & Ostlund,  ; de Wit & Dickinson,  ; Urcuioli,  ). In our previously reported experimental setup (Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ), it was impossible to decide whether the observed LPFC–caudate coupling effects indicated O–R association encoding by itself or rather the active usage of increasingly learned O–R associations through the S–O → O–R chain. In the present study, we therefore added a test phase after each S–R–O learning phase, in which previous outcomes now served as imperative stimuli that required responses that could be either compatible or incompatible with the previously acquired O–R associations. Thereby, we were able to obtain a relatively pure measure of O–R association strength. 

As in our previous design, S–R–O learning was induced via the introduction of differential response outcomes during instructed S–R learning, which means that each distinct S–R link was followed by a distinct outcome (Colwill & Rescorla,  ; de Wit & Dickinson,  ; Noonan, Mars, & Rushworth,  ; Shin, Proctor, & Capaldi,  ; Trapold,  ; Urcuioli,  ). Typically, in trial-and-error learning situations this “differential outcome effect” is evidenced by a more rapid decline of error rates from initial chance-level performance when comparing differential outcome conditions to common or random outcome conditions (Trapold,  ; Urcuioli,  ) and when the S–R learning task is sufficiently demanding (Estévez, Fuentes, Mari-Beffa, González, & Alvarez,  ; Legge & Spetch,  ). In instruction-based learning, which is characterized by an extremely low error rate from the start, this error rate effect clearly cannot serve as an adequate marker of outcome integration. But S–R learning that is too easy to show any further benefit of differential outcomes on error rates is nevertheless associated with significant response-slowing across learning when compared to a common outcome condition (Ruge, Krebs, & Wolfensteller,  ). Analogous to the accelerated error rate decline in demanding trial and error learning situations, response slowing during instruction-based S–R–O learning can be interpreted as a putative index of active O–R usage for the online control of goal-directed action selection. This is generally consistent with the notion that differential outcomes are rapidly integrated into an extended model of the current task instruction mediated via the “fast-learning but slow-acting” prefrontal cortex control system (cf. Dolan & Dayan,  ).  In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that such quickly established prefrontal S–R–O representations enable goal-directed action selection via functional couplings with the anterior caudate nucleus. 

Besides O–R-related response slowing across S–R–O learning, which we suggest is indicative of active O–R usage, numerous studies conducted in the realm of ideomotor theory (Greenwald,  ) have shown that the strength of O–R encoding by itself is expressed in O–R compatibility effects measured in a subsequent outcome-priming test phase (for a review, see Shin et al.,  ). Such O–R compatibility effects are taken to indicate that perceiving a previous outcome activates automatically or unintentionally the action that it was previously produced by and that can be either compatible or incompatible with the current test-phase response requirements (Elsner & Hommel,  ; Shin et al.,  ). Importantly, this effect can be observed even after very short acquisition periods as in the present study (Ruge et al.,  ; Wolfensteller & Ruge,  ). The size of the O–R compatibility effect can hence serve as an index of “O–R encoding” analogously to previous fMRI studies based on the “subsequent memory” rationale, in which postlearning behavioral indices are correlated with brain activation recorded during learning (Brewer, Zhao, Desmond, Glover, & Gabrieli,  ; Summerfield et al.,  ). Hence, on the basis of this additional O–R compatibility index we aimed to determine the specificity of the hypothesized LPFC–caudate coupling for active O–R usage rather than O–R encoding by itself. Moreover, using a similar rationale, previous ideomotor learning studies reported activations in the hippocampus when extensively learnt response outcomes served as primes that should automatically trigger response tendencies consistent with previously established O–R associations (Elsner et al.,  ; Melcher et al.,  ). Different from these studies that investigated highly overlearned O–R associations, we hypothesized that hippocampal O–R encoding under instruction-based learning conditions and especially during an early phase of learning might depend on the functional coupling with the LPFC (Huang et al.,  ). 


## Method 
  
### Subjects 
  
Twenty-eight human subjects participated in this study. Four of the subjects were excluded due to high error rates exceeding 25 % on the first unguided implementation trial (see below), suggesting that the instructions were not well memorized, thereby inducing a strong (undesired) trial-and-error learning component. An additional subject was excluded due to early abandoning of the experiment. The mean age of the remaining 23 subjects was 24.2, ranging between 18 and 31 years (12 female, 11 male). The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Technische Universität Dresden in agreement with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects gave written informed consent prior to taking part in the experiment and were paid €8 per hour or received course credit. 


### Materials and procedure 
  
#### S–R–O learning phase 
  
We employed a modified version of our original instruction-based learning paradigm (Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ). Instructions were delivered via a “guided implementation” procedure in which the instruction was embedded within the first few behavioral implementation trials, which also comprised the presentation of differential outcomes following correct responses (see Fig.  ). The guided implementation phase comprised 12 correct trials, including three repetitions of four distinct S–R–O triples (termed   S–R–O repetition   in the following discussion). A trial started with the presentation of the visual stimulus S for 500 ms. The visual stimuli were four distinct abstract shapes. Following 250 ms after S onset, an additional instruction stimulus (IS) was displayed, which remained on screen until a response was made or until timeout after 1,750 ms. The IS was a yellow square highlighting one of four constantly displayed empty boxes. The manual responses (left middle finger, left index finger, right index finger, and right middle finger) were mapped in a spatially compatible manner to the IS position. The differential outcomes were four distinct naturalistic sounds and were emitted for 500 ms directly following a correct response. This guided implementation phase was followed by an unguided implementation phase in which the IS was omitted, which comprised another 20 correct trials (i.e., five repetitions of the four distinct S–R–O triples). Hence, starting from the fourth S–R–O repetition, the correct response had to be retrieved from memory, since it was not indicated by the IS anymore. Erroneous trials were directly repeated in both learning phases, and the outcome was replaced by the German word for “error.” The experiment comprised 11 such S–R–O learning blocks, each with novel visual stimuli and novel outcome sounds. The intertrial interval (ITI) was randomly selected from a distribution including interval durations of 800 ms (24 trials per block), 2,350 ms (five trials per block), and 4,700 ms (three trials per block). Analyses of learning-related changes in behavior and brain activation were based on SRO repetitions, with levels ranging between SRO-Rep1 and SRO-Rep8.

During the experiment, subjects had to learn 11 different mappings, each involving novel visual stimuli and novel sound outcomes. (B) A novel S–R–O mapping was learned through explicit instruction provided by the instruction cues presented in the “guided implementation phase,” comprising the first three repetitions of each of the four S–R–O triples. During the “unguided implementation phase” (S–R–O Repetitions 4–8), instruction cues were no longer presented, and hence the correct response had to be retrieved from memory. 
  


#### O–R test phase 
  
Each of the 11 S–R–O learning blocks was followed by a test phase probing the strength of the just-encoded O–R associations, similar to the typical testing procedures used in the context of ideomotor theory (Shin et al.,  ). The previous outcome sounds were now serving as stimuli that again required one of the four responses (see Fig.  ). The responses keys were the same as during the preceding S–R–O learning phase. Two outcome sounds were mapped to the response that had produced that sound in the preceding phase (  compatible   trials), whereas the two remaining outcome sounds were mapped to responses that had produced another sound before (  incompatible   trials). Hence, according to ideomotor theory, previously learned O–R associations should prime the correct response in compatible trials, and the incorrect response in incompatible trials. As in the preceding S–R–O learning phase, the novel sound–response mappings were learned via the two-step instruction procedure, comprising 12 guided and 20 unguided implementation trials. The instruction stimuli (ISs) were now the letters D, F, J, and K, presented centrally on the screen and mapped onto the left middle finger, left index finger, right index finger, and right middle finger, respectively. Different IS types were used in the learning and test phases, to deconfound O–R and IS–R compatibility. The nonspatial IS–response mapping was practiced outside the scanner until performance accuracy was greater than 90 % in two consecutive blocks of 20 trials. A trial started with a fixation cross displayed for 500 ms, followed by the sound, lasting 500 ms. In the guided phase, the IS was presented 150 ms after sound onset and lasted until the response or until timeout after 1,500 ms. Accuracy feedback was displayed for 650 ms, indicating correct, wrong, or too-slow responses. The ITI distribution was the same as in the S–R–O learning phase. Note that the test-phase data were exclusively used to extract the behavioral O–R compatibility index, based on the unguided implementation trials. This index then served as a covariate in the fMRI analysis of the S–R–O learning-phase brain activation data. Before entering the scanner, subjects completed one S–R–O learning block and one O–R test block to familiarize them with the task procedure.   
Schematic representation of the O–R test phase. The four sound stimuli that had been produced by certain responses in the S–R–O learning phase now served as imperative stimuli in the test phase. The required response could be the same (compatible) or different (incompatible), with respect to the response that had produced that sound beforehand. The correct response was indicated by the instruction cues (letters D, F, J, and K) during the first three repetitions of each of the four sound–response pairs. Starting from the fourth repetition, the correct response had to be retrieved from memory. Test-phase data were solely used to compute the size of the behavioral O–R compatibility effect, as an index of O–R strength, which was then correlated with the brain activation data collected during the preceding S–R–O learning phase. 
  



### FMRI recording 
  
Whole-brain images were acquired on a Siemens 3-T whole-body Trio System (Erlangen, Germany) with a 16-channel circularly polarized head coil. Headphones (MR-Confon) dampened the scanner noise and were used for sound presentation. Both structural and functional images were acquired for each subject. High-resolution structural images (1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm) were acquired using an MP-RAGE T1-weighted sequence (TR = 1,900 ms, TE = 2.26 ms, TI = 900 ms, flip = 9°). Functional images were acquired using a gradient echo-planar sequence (TR =2,000 ms, TE =30 ms, flip =80°). Each volume contained 32 4.0-mm-thick slices (in-plane resolution 4.0 ×4.0 mm) plus 0.8-mm gap. Slices were oriented parallel to the AC–PC plane. The experiment was controlled by E-Prime 2.0 software running on a Windows XP PC. Visual stimuli were displayed by an LCD projector on a back-projection screen mounted behind the magnet. Subjects viewed the screen through mirror glasses. A fiber-optic, light-sensitive keypress device was used to record subjects’ behavioral responses. 


### fMRI preprocessing 
  
The fMRI data set was analyzed with SPM8 running under MATLAB 8.0.0.783. Preprocessing included slice-time correction, rigid body movement correction (three translation, three rotation parameters), and normalization of the functional images by directly registering the mean functional image to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) echo-planar-imaging template image provided by SPM8, with a resulting interpolated spatial resolution of 3 × 3 × 3 mm. Finally, images were spatially smoothed (Gaussian kernel, full width at half maximum = 8 mm). During model estimation, a temporal high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1/256 Hz was applied. 


### fMRI analysis 
  
#### First-level analysis 
  
For the analysis of the functional couplings between LPFC and any other voxel in the brain, we used the psychophysiological interaction (PPI) framework implemented in SPM8 (Friston et al.,  ; Gitelman, Penny, Ashburner, & Friston,  ) in its generalized form proposed recently (McLaren, Ries, Xu, & Johnson,  ). Essentially, the PPI method predicts the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal time course in “target” voxels anywhere in the brain volume, on the basis of the BOLD signal time course in a prespecified “seed” voxel. Importantly, functional coupling is not simply defined by a significant regression between two BOLD signal time courses, but it is defined in terms of changes in regression slopes as a function of varying psychological states associated with two experimental conditions A versus B. The generalized PPI used here accommodates situations in which the two contrasted conditions are occurring in the context of additional experimental conditions intermixed with the conditions of interest. For each experimental condition two regressors were included in a generalized linear model (GLM). This includes a standard event-related regressor obtained by convolving a canonical BOLD response model with a stick function representing the repeated occurrences of that condition. This “task regressor” picks up the average event-related BOLD activation level associated with that condition. The second regressor is obtained by multiplying the task regressor with the seed voxel activation time course (by first deconvolving the seed voxel activation time course, then multiplying with the task-related stick function, and then reconvolving with the canonical BOLD response, all as described by Gitelman et al.,  ). In linear combination with the task regressor, this “PPI regressor” picks up any trial-to-trial deviation from the mean task-related activation that is common between seed voxel and target voxel. Hence, the PPI regressor measures task-related synchrony between the seed-voxel and target-voxel activation time courses, which defines the term “functional coupling” used in the present article. Finally, the GLM comprises the seed voxel time course as an additional regressor to bind unspecific sources of covariance between seed voxel and target voxel. In the present study, we analyzed PPI regressor estimates for early learning trials (SRO-Rep2 and SRO-Rep3) and late learning trials (SRO-Rep7 and SRO-Rep8). Note that we did not include SRO-Rep1 within the category of early learning trials as this was considered to be a very special condition comprising a strong perceptual novelty component due to the fact that visual stimuli and sounds were perceived for the very first time. Hence, we considered SRO-Rep2 and SRO-Rep3 to be more “neutral” instances of early learning trials. 


#### Second-level analysis 
  
The primary goal of the present study was to determine possible correlations between the two putative behavioral measures of O–R encoding strength and O–R usage, on the one hand, and the functional coupling between lateral PFC and other brain structures, on the other hand. We therefore included both behavioral indices as covariates in the group-level analysis of PPI effects. By simultaneously including both covariates, we made sure that a correlation between PPI effect and one covariate was uniquely driven by a covariance component that was orthogonal to the other covariate. In other words, we determined partial correlations between the PPI effect and one covariate, with the potential influence of the other covariate being regressed out. Note that this procedure does not exclude the possibility that both covariates might be significantly correlated with the same PPI effect in the same target voxel. Yet, these correlations would then be due to different covariance sources. To make sure that we would not miss any significant correlation due to covariance components common to both covariates, we additionally computed group-level analyses that comprised only one of the two covariates, respectively (to foreshadow the results: We did not observe such additional effects). Furthermore, we ran complementary control analyses that included error rate changes across learning as an additional covariate (see below, Step 3 of the analysis). 

The covariance analysis proceeded in three steps. We first identified for each covariate significant correlations with the PPI effect defined by the difference in functional couplings in late learning trials relative to early learning trials. Significant activations were required to exceed a family-wise-error (FWE) threshold   p   < .05, adjusted for the volume of each selected region of interest (ROI) either on the voxel level or on the cluster level at a cluster-forming threshold of   p   < .001 (see below for our ROI selection). To search for significant effects outside of the preselected ROIs, we also computed FWE-corrected whole-brain statistics. 

In a second step, we performed post-hoc tests to determine whether a significant activation identified in Step 1 was linked to correlations between the behavioral covariate and functional couplings in early learning trials, mid learning trials (SRO-Rep5 and SRO-Rep6), and late learning trials. 

In a third step, we ran two complementary control analyses including the subject-wise error rate difference between the late and early learning trials as an additional covariate, either in combination with the covariate for O–R encoding strength or in combination with the covariate for O–R usage. These final analyses were performed in order to control for potential confounding effects between the indices for O–R encoding strength and O–R usage, on the one hand, and error rate differences across S–R–O learning, on the other hand. Even though the mean error rates early and late in learning were low (1.8 % and 4.8 %, respectively, and given an error rate of 75 % for chance performance), this control analysis nevertheless seemed warranted, since error rates varied considerably across subjects (ranging between 0 % and 9 % early and between 0 % and 14 % late). 

One possible confounding might be that relative response slowing was directly related to difficulties in instructed S–R translation rather than to the extent of increasing O–R usage. Accordingly, higher error rates late in learning could potentially be associated with slower responding due to higher uncertainty about which response alternative to select given a particular stimulus (since the correct response might not yet be recalled with certainty). 

Another possible confounding might be that functional couplings associated with O–R encoding strength might primarily engage in error-driven S–R learning, which might as a side effect also drive O–R learning (possibly even elsewhere in the brain). 


#### Regions of interest 
  
Analogously to Ruge and Wolfensteller ( ), and in line with other studies on instruction-based learning (Dumontheil, Thompson, & Duncan,  ; Hartstra, Kuhn, Verguts, & Brass,  ), the left posterior LPFC was selected as a seed region (MNI coordinates: –42 8 32). Likewise analogously to Ruge and Wolfensteller ( ), this voxel was selected on the basis of a standard univariate analysis that identified the strongest learning-related activation changes within posterior LPFC via an   F   test computing the main effect across all eight S–R–O repetition levels, with   p  (  F  ) < .05, FWE-corrected on the whole-brain level. 

We looked for significant PPI effects in three ROIs, including most importantly the left and right basal ganglia as the regions of primary theoretical interest. Additionally, we included the left and right hippocampus, which has been reported in previous studies on instruction-based control (Li et al.,  ; Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ) and has been suggested to play a critical role in such processes in a formal neurocomputational model (Huang et al.,  ). As a third ROI, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was included, defined by Brodmann areas BA11 and BA47. We included this region because previous studies had suggested its importance in goal-directed action control (e.g., Noonan, Kolling, Walton, & Rushworth,  ; Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ; Valentin, Dickinson, & O’Doherty,  ). Anatomical information was taken from the automatic anatomic labeling atlas (AAL) for the basal ganglia and hippocampus (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al.,  ) and from the Brodmann parcellation used in the MRICRON software for the OFC ROI (Rorden, Karnath, & Bonilha,  ). 




## Results 
  
### Behavior (S–R–O learning phase) 
  
We computed two separate one-way repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with the factor S–R–O Repetition (SRO-Rep1 through SRO-Rep8) for mean response times (RTs) and mean error rates using SPSS 21. The analyses revealed highly significant S–R–O repetition effects for both RTs [  F  (3, 63) = 67.3,   p  (  F  ) < .001, Greenhouse–Geisser corrected] and errors [  F  (3, 70) = 15.1,   p  (  F  ) < .001, Greenhouse–Geisser corrected]. As expected, we observed a sharp drop in RTs from SRO-Rep1 to SRO-Rep2, likely reflecting a strong “orienting response” upon the introduction of novel stimuli at SRO-Rep1 (see Fig.  ). This was followed by a slight RT increase at SRO-Rep4, indicating the transition into the unguided phase, in which responses had to be selected on the basis of memorized S–R association from the preceding guided learning phase. Then, RTs gradually declined until SRO-Rep8. The learning curve for error rates is mainly characterized by a sharp increase in errors at SRO-Rep4, again indicating the transition into memory-based response selection. Notably, the group mean was 11 % errors at SRO-Rep4, which quickly dropped down to 5 % (see Fig.  ). This indicates that the S–R instruction was well learned, given an expected error rate of 75 % for chance-level performance, due to the four independent and equally probable response choices. The subject-wise behavioral index of active O–R usage entered into the fMRI covariance analysis was defined as the individual RT difference between late learning trials (the mean of SRO-Rep7 and SRO-Rep8) and early learning trials (the mean of SRO-Rep2 and SRO-Rep3). Note that on the mean group level, a significant mean response speed-up was indicated by a negative mean difference between SRO-Rep7/8 and SRO-Rep2/3. Hence, as in previous experiments (Ruge et al.,  ), the O–R-related relative slowing effect was supposed to be embedded in a general speeding effect. This overall speeding effect likely reflects increasingly fluent S–R translation associated with decreasing error rates, which indicates decreasing response uncertainty as fewer response alternatives have to be considered (see also the third step of the second-level fMRI analysis, in the   section).  To determine the extent to which intersubject variability in response slowing might in fact be due to variability in the S–R-related speed up rather than in O–R-related slowing, we computed the correlation between the RT differences (late – early) and the error rate differences (late – early). This correlation was, however, close to zero, with   r   = .033 (  p   < .88, two-sided), suggesting that variability in response slowing cannot be reduced to the degree of uncertainty in S–R translation, expressed in error rates. In fact, this nonsignificant result might be due to the relatively tiny error rates and error rate changes from early to late in learning, which might hence affect RTs only very marginally.

### Behavior (test phase) 
  
We computed two one-sided paired   t   tests to determine the O–R compatibility effect (incompatible > compatible) for RTs and mean error rates collected during the unguided test phase. The analyses revealed highly significant O–R compatibility effects for RT [  t  (22) = 3.1,   p  (  t  ) < .005] and a just-significant effect also for errors [  t  (22) = 1.7,   p  (  t  ) < .05]. The subject-wise behavioral index of O–R encoding strength that entered the fMRI covariance analysis was defined as the individual O–R compatibility effect in RT. The correlation between the O–R compatibility effect in the test phase and SRO-related response slowing during the preceding S–R–O learning phase was not significant (  r   = –.28,   p  (  r  ) < .20, two-sided). Notably, this is a deviation from previous results, in which we did find significant positive correlations between slowing and the subsequent O–R compatibility effect (Ruge et al.,  ). Currently, it remains elusive which of the various design differences between the present study and the previous study might be responsible for the diverging results. 

We also computed the correlation between O–R compatibility effect and the error rate difference during learning, to assess the potential confound between feedback-driven S–R learning and O–R encoding (see also the third step of the second-level fMRI analysis, in the   section). This correlation was positive but nonsignificant, with   r   = .32 (  p   < .14, two-sided), suggesting that the O–R compatibility effect was not substantially related to uncertainty in S–R translation, expressed in the error rates. Note that during the fMRI analysis we nevertheless performed a control analysis including error rate as an additional covariate, to partial out any common covariance between O–R compatibility, error rate difference, and brain activation. 


### fMRI 
  
We first assessed general changes in functional couplings with the LPFC seed from early to late S–R–O learning trials. This analysis replicated previous findings by Ruge and Wolfensteller ( ). Specifically, we found increasing functional couplings between LPFC and anterior caudate, as well between LPFC and OFC (Table  ).   
Functional coupling with LPFC during S–R–O learning (late > early) 
  

The analysis of primary importance assessed potential correlations between changes in LPFC couplings and the two behavioral covariates. A learning-related increase in the functional coupling between LPFC and bilateral anterior caudate was positively correlated with response slowing as the putative maker of active O–R usage, but not with the O–R compatibility effect as a putative marker of O–R encoding (see Table   and Figs.   and  ). The positive correlation between response slowing and LPFC–caudate coupling evolved during learning, with a significant effect late in learning but no significant effect early in learning. This pattern was confirmed by a median split sorting subjects into two groups according to the size of the O–R usage index (Fig.  ). Moreover, the same correlational pattern was observed for the left posterior hippocampus (note that a similar, but nonsignificant, effect was observed in the homologous right posterior hippocampus). Supplementary Table   additionally includes the correlation coefficients for the association between response slowing and functional couplings for mid learning trials in relation to early and late learning trials. For all identified areas, this complementary analysis demonstrates a gradual increase from early to late with mid-learning correlations always lying between these two values. This means that the observed effects were not just driven by differences in functional couplings between guided (SRO-Rep1/2/3) and unguided (SRO-Rep4/5/6/7/8) learning trials, which might have been potentially associated solely with differences in S–R retrieval demands.

Voxels colored in blue (Putamen and anterior Hippocampus) depict significant correlations across subjects between the PPI effect and the behavioral index of O–R encoding strength.

For visualization purposes, the images were thresholded at   p   < .005 uncorrected. 
    
Summary of the results obtained by the left lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC)-seeded (MNI –42 8 28) PPI analysis for two exemplary clusters exhibiting significant correlations with the behavioral indices of either active O–R usage (i.e., RT slowing; red/light grey in print) or O–R encoding strength (i.e., O–R compatibility effect; blue/dark grey in print). (A) Scatterplots depict correlations between the behavioral indices and the gPPI effects for late versus early learning trials. (B) The bar graphs depict the size of the gPPI effects in early and late learning trials, shown separately for two groups of subjects defined by median splits according to O–R usage (left) and O–R encoding strength (right). 
  

In contrast to O–R usage, O–R encoding strength by itself (i.e., size of the postlearning O–R compatibility effect) was correlated with a different set of functional couplings, and this correlation was structured in a completely different way (see Table   and Figs.   and  ). Specifically, O–R encoding strength was negatively correlated with LPFC–putamen functional coupling late in learning, and additionally positively correlated with LPFC–putamen functional coupling early in learning. Again, this pattern was confirmed by a median split sorting subjects into two groups according to the size of the O–R encoding-strength index (Fig.  ). The same correlational pattern was also observed for the left and right anterior hippocampi. Supplementary Table   additionally includes the correlation coefficients for the association between O–R compatibility and functional couplings for mid learning in relation to early and late in learning. For all identified areas, this complementary analysis demonstrates a gradual decrease from early to late, with mid-learning correlations always lying between these two values. Again, this means that the observed effects were not primarily driven by differences in functional couplings between guided (SRO-Rep1/2/3) and unguided (SRO-Rep4/5/6/7/8) learning trials.

 p   < .05;   p   < .01;   p   < .001; (n.s.) not significant 
  

Finally, we found no significant correlation between the behavioral indices and learning-related BOLD activation in striatal or orbitofrontal areas without considering their functional coupling with LPFC. A direct correlation with O–R strength was observed only for the most dorsal section of the left and right hippocampi [MNI –18 –37 1 and MNI 21 –34 4,   t   = 4.78;   p  (FWE) < .015 and   t   = 7.1,   p  (FWE) < .001]. But these hippocampal activation clusters were entirely nonoverlapping with the posterior hippocampal regions that exhibited a correlation between LPFC coupling and O–R usage. 


### Control analyses 
  
Two additional analyses were performed in order to exclude the possibility that any of the above reported correlations between functional couplings and the behavioral indices of O–R usage and O–R encoding strength might equally well be explained by interindividual differences in error rates related to S–R learning (see also the third step of the second-level fMRI analysis in the   section). In general, the opposite seems to be true. Simultaneously entering response slowing and error rate difference (late vs. early) as covariates slightly increased rather than decreased the   t   values for the response-slowing covariate (Supplementary Table  ). The error rate covariate did not reach significance after small-volume FWE correction. Simultaneously entering the two covariates O–R compatibility and error rate difference (late vs. early) substantially increased rather than decreased the   t   values for the O–R compatibility covariate (Supplementary Table  ). This suggests that interindividual differences in error rates and O–R compatibility effects bind different variance components in the relevant brain areas that would otherwise be part of the residual, and hence would reduce   t   values. This interpretation is further corroborated by the finding that the error rate difference (late vs. early) significantly correlated with the learning-related coupling between LPFC and areas within putamen and anterior hippocampus that are highly similar to those found for the O–R compatibility covariate (Table  ).

## Discussion 
  
This study was set up to characterize the relationship between behavioral and neural indices of model-based (here: instruction-based) learning of novel goal-directed actions. Specifically, by combining the two data modalities, we aimed to gain novel insights about possible subprocesses of integrating O–R contingencies into the current task model that are difficult to obtain by separately assessing behavioral and neural data in isolation. One specific focus was on the anterior caudate, a region implicated in goal-directed behavior in feedback-driven learning situations (O’Doherty et al.,  ; Tanaka, Balleine, & O’Doherty,  ; Tricomi, Delgado, & Fiez,  ) and tightly coupled to the LPFC in instruction-based learning situations, especially with high rather than low O–R contingency (Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ). 

In the present study, we found clear indication that active O–R usage (increasing response slowing across S–R–O learning) was specifically associated with increasing learning-related functional coupling between the LPFC and anterior caudate. By contrast, O–R encoding strength by itself (test-phase O–R compatibility effect in response times) was linked to the coupling between LPFC and putamen (i.e., the rodent dorsolateral striatum), which constitutes the putative striatal subdivision held to be responsible for habit formation (Balleine & Ostlund,  ; Yin & Knowlton,  ) at least during intermediate stages of automatization (Ashby et al.,  ). Similar to the functional differentiation of striatal couplings with the LPFC, we also found distinct hippocampal areas that were coupled with LPFC as a function of either O–R usage (posterior hippocampus) or O–R encoding strength (anterior hippocampus). 

Importantly, none of the mentioned correlations between LPFC-seeded couplings and O–R encoding strength or O–R usage could be reduced to interindividual variability in S–R learning as indexed by error rates. On the contrary, variability in S–R learning and variability in O–R learning seem to be independently associated with couplings between LPFC and almost identical locations in putamen and hippocampus under instruction-based learning conditions. Thus, although S–R learning and O–R learning seem to share common neural substrates, the engagement of these shared neural resources for S–R learning and O–R learning is dissociated across subjects (e.g., a good early S–R learner is not necessarily a good early O–R learner and vice versa). This independence of correlations might be surprising on the one hand, as O–R learning can be regarded as being closely related to S–R learning (cf. Balleine & Ostlund,  ). In both cases a mental representation of a stimulus becomes associated with a response. However, on the other hand, it is also clear that additional sources of variability might affect O–R learning even though the O is essentially also just a stimulus. First, the S in S–R learning is sensorially present prior to responding whereas the O is only mentally represented prior to responding. Second, to become mentally represented in the first place, the O needs be retrieved through S–O associations that must have been learned beforehand. Both aspects might add across-subjects variability specifically in O–R learning that is not present in S–R learning. 

Another important observation is that, without considering functional couplings to the LPFC, neither caudate nor putamen were correlated with the behavioral indices of O–R strength or O–R usage, respectively. This is generally a crucial point to make as the striatal dependency on LPFC activation is exactly what is expected for theoretical reasons when learning is based on an explicit model of O–R contingencies temporarily being stored in the LPFC (Doll et al.,  ; Doll et al.,  ; Ramamoorthy & Verguts,  ). However, it should be noted that the type of connectivity analysis chosen here does not warrant unequivocal statements about causal relationships. Hence, it might well be that the functional couplings between LPFC and striatal areas are in fact driven by common input from other areas. For instance, O–R learning might take place in the putamen as well as in the LPFC, but both might be only indirectly coupled via a common driving input from S–O encoding processes that might possibly be mediated by orbitofrontal regions, especially for nonincentive outcomes like the ones employed in the present study (Clark, Hollon, & Phillips,  ; McNamee, Rangel, & O’Doherty,  ). 

Furthermore, the observed fronto-striatal couplings were not only differentially correlated with O–R usage and O–R encoding, but the temporal structure of these correlations was entirely different. O–R usage was positively correlated with LPFC–caudate coupling late in learning but not yet early in learning. This might simply suggest that it takes a few learning cycles before the full S–R–O contingency model is being integrated into caudate-based action selection processes. These “few learning cycles” do not seem to be directly related to our O–R encoding index, which was neither correlated with the behavioral O–R usage index nor modulated the correlation between O–R usage and LPFC–caudate coupling. Hence, although it is a necessary element in the putative S-O → O–R chain, successful O–R encoding alone is not sufficient for O–R usage. 

The correlational dynamics regarding LPFC–putamen coupling were different. Specifically, O–R encoding strength was negatively correlated with LPFC–putamen coupling late in learning and additionally positively correlated with LPFC–putamen coupling early in learning. This seems to suggest that good O–R learners (indicated by strong O–R compatibility effects) benefited from an early boost in LPFC–putamen coupling leaving quite some time for subsequent O–R consolidation. By contrast, the late boost of the same couplings in weak O–R learners might imply less remaining time for O–R consolidation, which in sum results in relatively poorly encoded O–R associations. Interestingly, the LPFC showed a similar temporal pattern of couplings with quite similar areas in the putamen (and anterior hippocampus, for that matter) as a function of the error rate difference between late and early stages in learning. Specifically, when the error rate was relatively high late (i.e., small error rate difference relative to early learning trials), LPFC–putamen coupling was relatively weak early and relatively strong late. By contrast, when the error rate was relatively low late, LPFC–putamen coupling was relatively strong early and relatively weak late. Together this suggests that the LPFC–putamen coupling increases whenever S–R learning is ongoing. In some subjects, S–R learning occurs early (accompanied by strong coupling) resulting in strongly reduced error rates late (accompanied by weak coupling). Other subjects show weak S–R learning early (accompanied by weak coupling) and have to catch up with S–R learning late (accompanied by strong coupling). 

### Specificity of LPFC–anterior caudate functional couplings 
  
Together, the present findings clearly suggest that the functional coupling between LPFC and anterior caudate is specifically linked to active O–R usage rather than O–R encoding by itself. Our findings go beyond previous studies that demonstrated an involvement of anterior caudate in instruction-based learning but did not look into possible functional couplings (Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ; Stocco, Lebiere, O’Reilly, & Anderson,  ), or that demonstrated functional couplings between PFC and caudate but did not establish a clear link with the expression of overt goal-directed behavior (Li et al.,  ; Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ). It is interesting to note that the observed correlation between O–R usage and LPFC-seeded functional coupling was located rather dorsally in the anterior caudate (  z   = +4). This corresponds roughly to a “dorsal striatum” region (  z   =0) that has previously been interpreted to be relevant for linking predicted outcomes to actions under trial-and-error learning conditions (O’Doherty et al.,  ). By contrast the same previous study implicated the “ventral striatum” region (  z   = –10) in stimulus-based outcome prediction. In the present study the ventral striatum (  z   = –8) exhibited a generally increased learning-related coupling with the LPFC without being modulated by O–R usage. Hence together, this might suggest that S–O prediction supported by the ventral anterior caudate region is relatively stable across subjects and only action selection based on that predicted outcome varies considerably between subjects. 

Generally, the convergence of results between trial-and-error learning and instruction-based learning highlights the strikingly similar functional differentiation within the anterior striatum. Yet, the important distinction seems to be that in the latter case it emerges through functional coupling with the LPFC. 


### Stimulus–response associations, outcome–response associations, and the habit concept 
  
The putamen is typically thought to be part of the habit system (Ashby et al.,  ; Dolan & Dayan,  ; Seger & Spiering,  ; Yin & Knowlton,  ). Accordingly, the association between LPFC–putamen coupling and S–R encoding (error rate index) and O–R encoding (O–R compatibility index) suggests an early formation of habit-like S–R and O–R memory traces under instructed learning conditions. These observations are in line with recent re-assessments of certain aspects of the traditional habit concept (e.g., Seger & Spiering,  ). First, it is well known that behavioral control shifts from goal-directed to habitual with extended practice. Contrary to this notion, in the present study the extent of practice was minimal (eight S–R–O repetitions). It is therefore likely that putamen involvement in the present context reflected not the behavioral control by habit-like representations, which would become increasingly dominant only with extended practice, but rather the initial formation of habit-like representations. Hence, learning-related LPFC–putamen coupling seems to reflect the initial formation of S–R and O–R representations as precursors of “true” habits, that would develop if practice would proceed substantially longer up to a point at which the putamen might act independently of the lateral PFC. This is in line with the classical distinction between latent learning and performance (Tolman,  ) and with results showing that deactivations of certain cortical regions in the rodent brain can shift behavioral control back-and-forth between habitual and goal-directed independent of the amount of practice (Killcross & Coutureau,  ). Generally, increasing evidence seems to support a concurrent engagement of both habit-related and goal-related computations early in practice (Brovelli, Nazarian, Meunier, & Boussaoud,  ; Dolan & Dayan,  ; Seger & Spiering,  ). 

Second, a habit is typically thought to be operating automatically and in the absence of voluntary control based on explicit knowledge buffered in the PFC. Contrary to this notion, in the present study the neural instantiation of precursors of both “S–R habits” and “O–R habits” emerged specifically via LPFC–putamen interaction suggesting an involvement of explicit contingency knowledge stored in the LPFC. Based on this we suggest the possibility that habits might be established via two different mechanisms. The classical mechanism would operate in the absence of awareness, completely model-free and solely relying on the putamen. Alternatively, habit (S–R as well as O–R) formation in the putamen might occur in the presence of awareness, scaffolded by an explicit model held in the LPFC. From a broader perspective, this characterization of LPFC function in rule-guided behavior is, for instance, in line with data showing that the LPFC is becoming engaged once a subject becomes aware of “hidden” (i.e., relatively complex) event contingencies (Rose, Haider, & Büchel,  ). 


### Functional couplings between LPFC and hippocampus 
  
Although previous studies have already demonstrated that instruction-based influences on learning are associated with fronto-hippocampal interactions (Li et al.,  ; Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ), the present dissociation between hippocampal subregions appears more difficult to account for conceptually than the dissociation between caudate and putamen discussed above. However, the hippocampus has recently been suggested to play an important role in predicting future states and this hippocampal capacity has in fact been linked to the goal-directed control of action (Fouquet et al.,  ; Johnson, van der Meer, & Redish,  ; Kennedy & Shapiro,  ; Zilli & Hasselmo,  ). Indeed it seems that—consistent with our results—a number of such studies have specifically implicated the posterior/dorsal hippocampus in goal-directed action control (Fouquet et al.,  ; Gourley, Lee, Howell, Pittenger, & Taylor,  ). 

More generally, the hippocampus is known to play a pivotal role in experience-based single-trial episodic memory formation and retrieval (e.g., O’Reilly & Rudy,  ; Rolls,  ; Tulving & Markowitsch,  ). Importantly, there is also ample evidence for an interaction between working memory and episodic memory processes that seems to be based on an interaction between LPFC and hippocampal/parahippocampal areas (Bergmann, Rijpkema, Fernández, & Kessels,  ; Meyer-Lindenberg et al.,  ; Ranganath, Cohen, & Brozinsky,  ; Zilli & Hasselmo,  ). For instance, anterior hippocampus activation at the time point of encoding has been shown to differentiate particularly well between subsequent correct and erroneous recall of an experienced episode (Summerfield et al.,  ). Notably, the same study also showed that the functional coupling between LPFC and anterior hippocampus predicted subsequent memory performance. Such a finding is in line with the present study results, which suggest a similar relevance of LPFC coupling with the anterior hippocampus during encoding for the subsequent retrieval of O–R associations as expressed in the size of the O–R compatibility effect. This coupling might indicate either the transfer of O–R working memory representation into episodic long-term memory (e.g., Ranganath et al.,  ) or it might reflect the integration of episodic O–R memories into the current task model stored in LPFC working memory. 

Interestingly, two other studies reported activations in the anterior hippocampus without LPFC coupling when extensively learnt response outcomes served as primes that should automatically trigger response tendencies consistent with previously established O–R associations (Elsner et al.,  ; Melcher et al.,  ). This suggests that the anterior hippocampus might become independent of LPFC after extensive learning of O–R associations and is not exclusively relevant for short-term O–R encoding/retrieval processes accomplished in cooperation with LPFC as is the case under instruction-based learning conditions in the present study. 



## Conclusions 
  
Together, our results suggest that fronto-striatal couplings enable the learning of novel goal-directed actions via an internal model of response–outcome contingencies buffered in LPFC “procedural working memory” (cf. Oberauer,  ). More specifically, the learning-related functional coupling between LPFC and anterior caudate is associated with O–R usage rather than with O–R encoding by itself. This suggests a pivotal role of the anterior caudate for establishing the online control of goal-directed action and implies a similar striatal specialization as in model-free feedback-driven learning, yet emerging through functional couplings with the LPFC. As another novel contribution, our study shows that hippocampal involvement in goal-directed action also emerges through functional couplings with the LPFC, and that this hippocampal involvement can be differentiated according to O–R usage (posterior/dorsal) and O–R encoding (anterior/ventral). It remains to be clarified whether the reported correlational effects between behavior and functional couplings are specific for instruction-based learning situations or would generalize to situations in which novel rules are entirely and solely extracted via trial and error.

# Abstract
 
The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the primary site of interactions between the neocortex and hippocampus. Studies in rodents and nonhuman primates suggest that EC can be divided into subregions that connect differentially with perirhinal cortex (PRC) vs parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and with hippocampal subfields along the proximo-distal axis. Here, we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla to identify functional subdivisions of the human EC. In two independent datasets, PRC showed preferential intrinsic functional connectivity with anterior-lateral EC and PHC with posterior-medial EC. These EC subregions, in turn, exhibited differential connectivity with proximal and distal subiculum. In contrast, connectivity of PRC and PHC with subiculum followed not only a proximal-distal but also an anterior-posterior gradient. Our data provide the first evidence that the human EC can be divided into functional subdivisions whose functional connectivity closely parallels the known anatomical connectivity patterns of the rodent and nonhuman primate EC.

In the early 1950s, an American named Henry Molaison underwent an experimental type of brain surgery to treat his severe epilepsy. The surgeon removed a region of the brain known as the temporal lobe from both sides of his brain. After the surgery, Molaison's epilepsy was greatly improved, but he was also left with a profound amnesia, unable to form new memories of recent events. 

Subsequent experiments, including many with Molaison himself as a subject, have attempted to identify the roles of the various structures within the temporal lobes. The hippocampus—which is involved in memory and spatial navigation—has received the most attention, but in recent years a region called the entorhinal cortex has also come to the fore. Known as the gateway to the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex relays sensory information from the outer cortex of the brain to the hippocampus. 

In rats and mice the entorhinal cortex can be divided into two subregions that have distinct connections to other parts of the temporal lobe. The ‘medial entorhinal cortex’ is the subregion nearest the centre of the brain, and it predominantly connects to parahippocampal cortex, which is involved in processing visual scenes. The other subregion, the ‘lateral entorhinal cortex’, is to the left or right of the center and has particularly strong connections to the perirhinal cortex, which is involved in the memory of objects. The two subregions are also connected to different parts of the hippocampus. 

For many years researchers had assumed that the connectivity of the human entorhinal cortex was quite similar to that observed in rats and mice. However, it was not possible to check this as the entorhinal cortex measures less than about 1 cm across, which placed it beyond the reach of most commonly available brain-imaging techniques. Now, two independent groups of researchers have used ultra high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to reveal a more complex structure in humans. The fMRI data reveal that the entorhinal cortex is divided into an anterior-lateral (to the front and at the side) subregion and a posterior-medial (to the back and at the centre) subregion in humans. 

One of the groups—Maass, Berron et al.—used the imaging data to show that the anterior-lateral and posterior-medial subregions of the entorhinal cortex form distinct patterns of connections with the perirhinal cortex and the parahippocampal cortex, as well as with different parts of the hippocampus. The other group—Navarro Schröder, Haak et al.—studied functional connections across the whole neocortex to come to the same conclusions. 

The discovery of these networks in the temporal lobe in humans will help to bridge the gap between studies of memory in rodents and in humans. Given that the lateral entorhinal cortex is one of the first regions to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, identifying the specific properties and roles of these networks could also provide insights into disease mechanisms.

## Introduction 
  
The entorhinal cortex (EC) is a major hub within the medial temporal lobe that mediates hippocampal-neocortical communication ( ;  ). Together with the adjacent perirhinal cortex (PRC) and parahippocampal cortex (PHC), these brain regions form a neural circuitry that is critical for learning and memory ( ;  ). Virtually nothing is known about how hippocampal and neocortical connectivity with the EC is organized in humans. This lack of knowledge has significantly limited the development of neurobiological theories of memory and navigation and our understanding of the clinical impact of localized EC damage in the early stages of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). 

Neuroanatomical evidence from studies in rodents suggests that there are two parallel input pathways that convey spatial and non-spatial input into the hippocampus via the EC ( ;  ;  ). Specifically, spatial information is conveyed from the postrhinal cortex (POR, thought to be homologous to the PHC in primates), which shows preferential connectivity with ‘medial EC’ (MEC). In contrast, non-spatial information is conveyed from the PRC to the ‘lateral EC’ (LEC). LEC and MEC, in turn, are differentially connected with hippocampal subfields (i.e., subiculum and CA1) along the proximo-distal (transverse) axis. Projections of the LEC preferentially target the region close to the border between CA1 and subiculum (distal CA1 and proximal subiculum), whereas the MEC preferentially projects to proximal CA1 and distal subiculum (e.g.,  ;  ). These partially segregated pathways have been differentially associated with the processing of, and memory for, object and context information (e.g.,  ; for review see;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, a recent network analysis on the rat connectome highlighted the LEC as a major cortical hub, forming the richest set of association connections of any cerebral cortical region ( ). 

Notably, although terminology for EC subdivisions in the rat emphasizes the lateral to medial axis, these areas do not differ solely with respect to their position in relation to the hippocampal formation and the rhinal fissure ( ). In actuality, LEC occupies the rostrolateral portion of the EC, whereas MEC occupies the caudomedial portion of the EC. In primates, ventral hippocampus and the adjacent EC are situated in a relatively more rostral position in the anterior temporal lobe. Although the position of the EC on the cortical surface and the orientation of anatomical axes differ across species, the relative topography of EC connectivity seems to be preserved in nonhuman primates. Anatomical studies suggest that the PRC is predominantly interconnected with the anterior third of the EC, whereas the PHC is predominantly interconnected with approximately the posterior two-thirds ( ). In addition, PRC/PHC connectivity with EC differs between lateral and medial domains ( ). A functional distinction between anterior and posterior EC has been substantiated by a single-unit recording study of grid-cell-like neurons in nonhuman primates ( ). 

To summarize, findings from rodents and nonhuman primates suggest that connectivity of the human EC might differ along the longitudinal and lateral-medial axis, but because anatomical tracing studies cannot be performed in humans, direct evidence for this idea is lacking. Recent structural and functional MRI studies have assumed a lateral-medial distinction in humans according to the rodent nomenclature of LEC and MEC. However, whether such a lateral-medial dissociation of EC connectivity exists in humans and/or whether connectivity differs along the anterior-posterior EC axis has not been assessed so far. 

Numerous studies have demonstrated that networks of brain regions linked by direct and indirect anatomical connections exhibit temporally coherent, low-frequency fluctuations in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data during both the resting and task states. Recent work has demonstrated that spatially contiguous but anatomically distinct brain regions can be reliably differentiated based on functional connectivity profiles measured with BOLD fMRI (for a review see  ). Using fMRI at 3 Tesla, human resting-state fMRI studies ( ;  ) have reported reliable differences in connectivity between the PRC and PHC with the hippocampus. Whereas the PRC showed higher functional connectivity with the anterior hippocampus, the PHC showed stronger connectivity with the posterior hippocampus, a dissociation that was most evident for subiculum and CA1 subfields ( ). Due to limitations in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution, these studies were unable to assess functional connectivity with the EC. 

Here, we used ultra-high resolution fMRI at 7 Tesla to characterize the functional organization of the human EC. The high SNR of MRI data collected at 7 Tesla makes it feasible to acquire BOLD fMRI data at an unprecedented level of anatomical detail (e.g.,  ). To determine the topographic organization of EC connectivity in humans, we conducted two experiments in which fMRI data were acquired with a resolution of 0.8 mm (isotropic). Notably, this level of spatial resolution is more than six times higher than in previous high-resolution fMRI studies that investigated intrinsic connectivity within the MTL ( ;  ). In two independent samples, we examined correlations of activation between individually anatomically defined PRC vs PHC seeds and the EC along its anterior-posterior and lateral-medial axis. In addition, we tested whether functionally distinct EC subregions also exhibited differential connectivity with the subiculum along a transverse or longitudinal hippocampal axis. In addition, we also analyzed connectivity profiles of PRC and PHC seeds with the subiculum. The present study, which focuses on patterns of EC connectivity within the MTL is complemented by a study by  , which examined connectivity topography of the EC with extended cortical networks outside of the MTL.

#### Seed-to-voxel connectivity of PRC vs PHC with EC 
  
We used 7T high-resolution fMRI to characterize and compare intrinsic functional connectivity profiles of PHC and PRC seed regions with the EC. Particularly, we investigated correlations of activity over time (spontaneous changes in the BOLD signal) between individually defined PRC and PHC seed regions and the EC across subjects. Seed-to-voxel correlation analyses were performed on the native (unnormalized) residual fMRI data after extraction of task-related activity (see ‘Materials and methods’ section for details). Resulting connectivity maps were normalized on a group-specific T1-template by means of Region of Interest-Advanced Normalization Tools (ROI-ANTS;  ;  ;  ). The template has the same resolution and alignment as the functional images, such that coronal images (as in  ) are oriented orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. Note that our terminology of axes (anterior-posterior, lateral-medial and dorsal-ventral) always refers to the longitudinal hippocampal axis, although the hippocampus has a slightly upward-tilted position when moving from anterior to posterior within the brain.

Group-level functional connectivity profiles of each seed region for Experiment 1 and 2 are shown in   and  , respectively (voxelwise one-sample t-tests, Z > 2.3, p  < 0.05). While the PRC showed significant connectivity with bilateral EC clusters covering approximately the anterior two-thirds of the EC, significant functional connectivity of the PHC was found with bilateral EC clusters comprising about the posterior two-thirds of the EC (see also peak coordinates of significant clusters in  ). Additionally, PRC-connectivity clusters were limited to progressively more lateral regions of the EC when moving posteriorly while PHC-connectivity clusters were limited to progressively more medial regions of the EC when moving anteriorly. Overlapping connectivity with both seeds was strongest in the transition zone between anterior-posterior and lateral-medial EC (see bright regions in   and  ).

Paired t-tests revealed those EC regions that exhibited significant stronger connectivity with PRC than PHC seeds, and vice versa (see  ). While stronger functional connectivity of the PRC was found with bilateral clusters in the anterior-lateral EC (al-EC), the PHC showed relatively stronger connectivity with bilateral clusters located in the posterior-medial EC (pm-EC). Paired t-test results are illustrated for Experiment 1 on  .    Differential connectivity topography of PRC vs PHC seeds with the EC for Experiment 1.  
(  A  ) To assess differential connectivity of PRC vs PHC with the EC, voxelwise paired-sample t-tests were performed on the normalized single-subject beta maps (resulting from seed-to-voxel connectivity analyses). Significant clusters for Exp. 1 are shown for two coronal sample slices (Z > 2.3. p  < 0.05, N  = 15) at the level of the anterior (1) and posterior (2) hippocampal head. (  B  ) To visualize the 3-dimensional geometry of connectivity, the connectivity preference with PRC vs PHC of each EC voxel was plotted along the x-, y-, and z-axis (red: T  > 0, blue: T  > 0). Axes terminology is relative to the long-axis of the hippocampus. (  C  ) Classification of PRC vs PHC connectivity preference was tested across subjects based on the x-y-z coordinate of an EC voxel. Multivariate classification (support vector machine; leave-one-subject-out cross-validation) was significant across both data sets (p < 0.001; accuracies: Exp. 1: left: 62%, right: 60%, Exp. 2: left: 67%, right: 57%), which confirms a spatial dissociation of entorhinal connectivity with PRC vs PHC. Predicted clusters are color-coded in red vs. blue, bright regions denote high consistency of the classifier (accuracy for each voxel across subjects). Results are shown for Exp. 1.

#### Three-dimensional topography of entorhinal connectivity 
  
In order to assess and visualize the 3-dimensional topography of differential EC connectivity with PRC vs PHC seeds, we plotted the connectivity preference of each voxel along the x-y-z direction (see   and  ). Connectivity preference was defined on the basis of the paired t-test t-maps (red: T  > 0; blue: T  > 0). These plots indicated a complex 3-dimensional topography of EC connectivity with a gradient of PRC-to-PHC preference running from anterior-ventral-lateral to posterior-dorsal-medial EC. In addition, we plotted functional connectivity preference of unilateral (left and right) PRC/PHC seeds with both the ipsi- and contralateral EC to evaluate whether connectivity patterns were symmetric across hemispheres (see   for results of data set 1). These additional analyses confirmed the findings of bilateral connectivity analyses with an anterior-posterior and lateral-medial gradient of EC connectivity for contralateral PRC and PHC seeds. These findings also suggest that the dissociation of EC connectivity cannot be simply explained by local autocorrelations of neighboring voxels. 

Our next analyses assessed the reliability of topographic differences in EC connectivity with PHC and PRC. If the topographic organization is reliable across participants, then it should be possible to predict the connectivity preference of specific EC voxels within any participant, simply by knowing the connectivity preferences of corresponding voxels in other participants. To test this strong prediction, we conducted a multivariate pattern classification analysis using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme. Specifically, we trained a multivariate support vector machine classifier (see ‘Materials and methods’ section) on data from all but one subject, entering only the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of each voxel and the relative preference of PRC and PHC connectivity (based on the subject's paired t-test t-maps, analogous to the definition of preference in the previous section). The classifier was then tested on the remaining subject, and the accuracy of this validation step was calculated as the proportion of EC voxels that were classified correctly as being preferentially connected to PRC or PHC in the tested subject. The training and cross-validation steps were repeated for all combinations of participants, and a mean classification accuracy score was computed. Classification accuracy was significantly above chance across both data sets (p < 0.001). Mean classifier accuracies across all EC voxels and subjects were around 60% (Exp. 1: left 62%, right 60%, Exp. 2: left 67%, right 57%). However, connectivity preference of voxels in the very anterior-lateral and posterior-medial EC could be predicted with more than 80% accuracy. These analyses confirm a spatial dissociation in connectivity between EC subregions with regard to PRC vs PHC seeds. Predicted clusters of preferential connectivity are color-coded in   (bright regions denote high consistency of the classifier). 

Moreover, we repeated the classification analysis on the combined data of both studies to predict al-EC and pm-EC functional subregions (based on preferential connectivity with PRC vs PHC) across all participants. Anatomical landmarks for these clusters are described further below in ‘Landmarks for delineation of al-EC and pm-EC’ and al-EC and pm-EC masks in template and MNI space are available online ( ). Moreover, predicted al-EC and pm-EC subregions as well as the subicular and parahippocampal subregions are shown in a 3D animation in  .    3D animation of entorhinal, subicular and parahippocampal subregions.

#### PRC and PHC show significantly different connectivity patterns along the transverse and longitudinal axis of the EC 
  
Anatomical studies in rodents have demonstrated a rostrolateral-caudomedial dissociation of EC connectivity with PRC vs PHC, and data in nonhuman primates suggest a similar gradient of differential connectivity along anterior-posterior and lateral-medial axes ( ;  ;  ). In order to directly test for significant differences of PRC vs PHC intrinsic functional connectivity between the anterior vs posterior and lateral vs medial EC, we divided the template EC ROI equally into four portions: anterior-lateral, anterior-medial, posterior-lateral and posterior-medial (see  , right panel). Mean parameter estimates for PRC and PHC connectivity (mean betas) were extracted across all voxels in each section for each subject. Note that the lateral-medial split was performed for each coronal slice individually as the EC is curved along the longitudinal axis and furthermore, that this separation also corresponds to a ventral-dorsal split.    Anterior-posterior and lateral-medial gradients of entorhinal connectivity with PRC vs PHC seeds.  
(  A  ) To test for an anterior-posterior or lateral-medial dissociation of EC connectivity with PRC vs PHC seeds (upper panel, left), we divided the EC template mask into four equal portions (upper panel, right) and extracted mean parameter estimates (betas) from each subsection. (  B  ) Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed significant seed (PRC vs PHC) × anterior-posterior EC section and seed × lateral-medial EC section interactions (p < 0.001 for both data sets; N  = 15, N  = 14). Slice-by-slice plots of connectivity estimates along the longitudinal and transverse EC axis confirmed an anterior-to-posterior and lateral-to-medial dissociation with decreasing PRC-connectivity and increasing PHC-connectivity. As the number of sagittal EC slices differed from anterior to posterior, we divided each coronal EC slice into 5 equal portions (with 1 being most lateral and 5 most medial EC) and calculated mean betas for each portion.

Repeated-measures ANOVAs with PRC and PHC connectivity estimates revealed significant two-way interactions of seed region × anterior-posterior EC section (Exp. 1: F(1,14) = 56.0, p < 0.001; Exp. 2: F(1,13) = 95.9, p < 0.001) and seed region × lateral-medial EC section (Exp. 1: F(1,14) = 11.3, p = 0.005; Exp. 2: F(1,13) = 32.8, p < 0.001). 

Follow-up paired sample t-tests confirmed significantly greater PRC than PHC connectivity with the anterior EC (Exp. 1: t(14) = 5.3; p < 0.001; Exp. 2: t(13) = 4.5, p = 0.001) and vice versa significant higher PHC than PRC connectivity with the posterior EC (Exp. 1: t(14) = 4.7; p < 0.001; Exp. 2: t(13) = 2.6; p = 0.019). With regard to the lateral-medial dissociation, the PRC showed significantly higher intrinsic functional connectivity than the PHC with the lateral EC section (Exp. 1: t(14) = 5.2; p < 0.001; Exp. 2: t(13) = 3.8, p = 0.002). However, there was no significant difference in connectivity between seeds with the medial section of the EC (all p-values > 0.80). Although connectivity estimates did not differ in the medial EC portion, the PHC showed significantly stronger connectivity with medial than lateral EC (Exp. 1: t(14) = 4.4; p < 0.001; Exp. 2 t(13) = 2.6, p = 0.021). There were no significant three-way interactions between seed, longitudinal and sagittal EC section (all p-values > 0.25). 

To characterize the topography of PRC and PHC functional connectivity with voxels along the longitudinal (anterior to posterior) and transverse (lateral to medial) axis of the EC, we plotted mean parameter estimates for each slice (see  ). These slice-by-slice plots further confirmed a dominant topographical organization of EC connectivity along the longitudinal axis with decreasing PRC connectivity and increasing PHC connectivity from anterior to posterior to EC. Furthermore, lateral to medial connectivity plots demonstrated decreasing PRC and increasing PHC connectivity. 



### Subicular connectivity profiles related to functional EC subregions and PRC/PHC 
  
#### EC subregions differentially interact with proximal and distal subiculum 
  
Anatomical studies in rodents have demonstrated that LEC and MEC exhibit different patterns of connectivity along the proximo-distal (transverse) axis of the subiculum and CA1 (e.g.,  ). Similarly, anterolateral vs posteromedial EC regions in nonhuman primates have been shown to exhibit differential connectivity with proximal vs distal subiculum and CA1 ( ). These findings motivated us to test whether functional connectivity between our functional EC subregions and the hippocampus is topographically organized. Within the hippocampus, we focused on the subiculum, based on previous findings demonstrating that the topographic organization of cortico-hippocampal functional connectivity is most prominent in the subiculum ( ). 

Consistent with our previous analyses for the EC, we divided the subiculum into four equal portions along the longitudinal (anterior vs posterior) and transverse (lateral [‘proximal’] vs medial [‘distal’]) axis. We then extracted mean parameter estimates of functional connectivity with anterior-lateral and posterior-medial EC for each subicular section and each subject and submitted them to a factorial ANOVA to test for connectivity differences as a function of EC subregion (al-EC vs pm-EC) and anterior vs posterior and proximal vs distal subiculum subregions. Similar to the division of the EC, we performed the proximal-distal cut individually for each coronal subiculum slice. 

Repeated-measures ANOVAs with EC seed connectivity estimates revealed a significant two-way interaction of seed EC subregion × proximal vs distal subiculum (Exp. 1: F(1,14) = 25.7, p < 0.001; Exp. 2: F(1,13) = 24.3, p < 0.001). However, there was no interaction between EC seed region and longitudinal subiculum sections (p > 0.26). Follow-up t-tests confirmed that the proximal subiculum showed significantly greater connectivity with al-EC than with pm-EC (Exp. 1: t(14) = 2.27; p = 0.040; Exp. 2: t(13) = 2.15; p = 0.049) and, conversely, that distal subiculum showed significantly greater connectivity with pm-EC than with al-EC (Exp. 1: t(14) = 3.06; p = 0.008; Exp. 2: t(13) = 4.24, p = 0.001). Slice-by-slice plots confirmed that connectivity of the al-EC decreased from proximal (lateral) to distal (medial) subiculum, whereas pm-EC connectivity increased (see   and   for data of Experiment 1 and 2, respectively).    Functional connectivity gradients in the subiculum related to EC subregions and PRC/PHC seeds.  
(  A  ) To test for differential connectivity of EC functional subdivisions with the subiculum, anterior-lateral EC (al-EC) and posterior-medial EC (pm-EC) regions that exhibited preferential connectivity with PRC vs PHC, respectively (see paired t-tests in  ) were used as seed regions. The subiculum ROI was equally divided into four portions along the longitudinal (anterior vs posterior) and transverse (proximal vs distal) axis and mean betas of functional connectivity with EC seeds extracted for each subsection. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed a significant seed (al-EC vs pm-EC) × proximal-distal subiculum interaction in both datasets (p < 0.001; N  = 15, N  = 14; results shown for Exp. 1). Slice-by-slice plots of connectivity estimates demonstrated decreasing al-EC-connectivity and increasing pm-EC connectivity from proximal to distal subiculum but no anterior-posterior dissociation. (  B  ) Similarly, connectivity for PRC vs PHC seeds with the subiculum along the longitudinal and transverse axis was evaluated. Seed (PRC vs PHC) × proximal-distal subiculum section interactions were significant across both datasets (p < 0.01) with preferential connectivity of PRC with proximal and PHC with distal subiculum, respectively. Slice-by-slice plots of connectivity estimates along the hippocampal long axis revealed stronger PRC connectivity with the most anterior and stronger PHC connectivity with the most posterior subiculum (= 8 slices), respectively (Exp. 1). See also   for data of Exp. 2.

#### Repeated-measures ANOVAs and slice-by-slice plots for PRC/PHC seeds 
  
Previous human resting-state fMRI studies at 3 Tesla ( ;  ) have reported reliable differences in connectivity between the PRC and PHC with the hippocampus along the longitudinal hippocampal axis, most prominently with the subiculum ( ). However, a dissociation of PRC vs PHC connectivity along the proximo-distal axis of the subiculum, as demonstrated between PRC and POR in rodents ( ,  ;  ), has not been reported so far in humans. 

In order to examine whether PRC vs PHC seeds show differential intrinsic functional connectivity with the subiculum along the transverse and/or longitudinal axis, we also tested for significant interactions between PRC vs PHC connectivity with anterior vs posterior or proximal vs distal subiculum. Repeated-measures ANOVAs with PRC and PHC connectivity estimates revealed a significant two-way interaction of seed region × proximal vs distal subiculum (Exp. 1: F(1,14) = 20.2, p = 0.001; Exp. 2: F(1,13) = 14.4, p = 0.002). However, the interaction between seed and anterior vs posterior subiculum was not significant (Exp. 1: F(1,14) = 2.5, p = 0.135; Exp. 2: F(1,13) = 1.4, p = 0.257). 

Follow-up t-tests confirmed significantly greater PRC than PHC connectivity with the proximal subiculum (Exp. 1: t(14) = 3.7; p = 0.002; Exp. 2: t(13) = 3.9, p = 0.002). With regard to distal subiculum there was significant higher PHC than PRC connectivity in Experiment 1 (t(14) = 3.1, p = 0.009) and a trend towards a difference in Experiment 2 (t(13) = 2.0; p = 0.063). 

Slice-by-slice plots further confirmed a dissociation of PRC/PHC connectivity along the transverse hippocampal axis with decreasing PRC connectivity and increasing PHC connectivity from proximal to distal subiculum (see   and   for data of Experiment 1 and 2, respectively). Although the interaction between PRC vs PHC seed and anterior-posterior subiculum was not significant, slice-by-slice extractions suggested that differential connectivity may be present in the most anterior and most posterior slices of subiculum. Additional analyses indeed revealed that PRC connectivity was significantly greater than PHC connectivity within the most anterior 8 slices of subiculum (Exp. 1: t(14) = 2.5; p = 0.022; Exp. 2: t(13) = 3.9, p = 0.002), while PHC connectivity was significantly higher than PRC connectivity within the most posterior 8 slices in Experiment 1 (t(14) = 2.3; p = 0.035 ), but not in Experiment 2 (t(13) < 1, p > 0.4). 

However, we note that we did not segment the subiculum within the hippocampal tail (where anatomical borders are difficult to delineate) and thus might underestimate any difference in the posterior subiculum. 


#### The topographic organization of PRC and PHC connectivity with subiculum differs from that of al-EC and pm-EC with subiculum 
  
The above analyses revealed that the connectivity differences between al-EC and pm-EC along the transverse axis of the subiculum parallel the differences between PRC and PHC. However, only PRC and PHC seeds showed dissociable connectivity gradients along the longitudinal axis of the subiculum, whereas no such difference was seen between al-EC and pm-EC. This suggests that the gradients of al-EC and pm-EC connectivity with subiculum are not merely a reflection of their differential connectivity with PRC and PHC. To quantify the differences between the connectivity profiles of entorhinal functional subregions and PRC/PHC along the long axis of the subiculum, we calculated differences between al-EC/pm-EC and PRC/PHC connectivity estimates for anterior and posterior subiculum subsections. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed a significant interaction between seed regions (∆al-EC/pm-EC vs ∆PRC/PHC) × longitudinal subiculum section (anterior vs posterior) for Experiment 1 (F(1,14) = 7.3, p = 0.017) with a similar trend evident in the dataset of Experiment 2 (F(1,13) = 3.4, p = 0.087). These additional analyses show that functional connectivity profiles of PRC vs PHC and al-EC vs pm-EC with the subiculum differ along the longitudinal hippocampal axis. 


#### Landmarks for delineation of al-EC and pm-EC 
  
We used the multivariate classification approach to predict al-EC and pm-EC subregions across all subjects. Based on the relative connectivity preference of an EC voxel across subjects the classifier predicts PRC or PHC connectivity preference for the left out subject. Thereby we can compute consistency maps that show the consistency of predictions for each EC voxel across all subjects. This revealed regions of high and low consistency. Based on the predictions of the classifier we created a PRC-connectivity preference (‘al-EC’) and a PHC-connectivity preference EC (‘pm-EC’) mask. To provide these masks in a more usable manner (not on a partial volume T1-template), we created a whole brain high-resolution T1-template based on the MPRAGEs of all participants (N = 29; voxel size: 0.6 mm  isotropic, AC-PC aligned). We then aligned the EC masks on the whole-brain template (linear registration) and manually corrected outer borders, if these did not fit perfectly. 

Below, we further describe the approximate boundaries of al- and pm-EC subregions based on coronal slices, moving from anterior to posterior on the whole brain template. These landmarks can be used for manual delineation of EC functional subregions. Notably, coronal slices on the whole-brain template are not orthogonally aligned to the hippocampal long-axis and have a different slice thickness compared to the partial-volume template on which results/figures are described. Furthermore, borders between al-EC and pm-EC differed slightly between hemispheres and thus landmarks are an intermediate approximation between sides. 

At the most anterior level of the EC (when the amygdala is visible) EC is fully covered by al-EC. Moving posteriorly, the hippocampal head (HH) starts. Around 3–4 slices (∼2 mm) after the first appearance of the HH, pm-EC appears at the very medial/dorsal tip of the EC, touching the amygdala. The border between pm-EC and al-EC approximately corresponds to the uncal notch, such that pm-EC covers the gyrus ambiens. Moving more posteriorly the border between pm-EC and al-EC moves progressively down (more lateral/ventral) until al-EC and pm-EC are around equal size at the level of two thirds of HH. At this level the amygdala has fully disappeared. Going further posteriorly the border between pm-EC and al-EC moves progressively more lateral/ventral, such that pm-EC also covers parts of the ventral/lateral EC half. At the level where the uncus separates from the HC (and only the fimbria is attached to both), the EC is almost fully covered by pm-EC. We delineated the EC until the collateral sulcus (or rhinal fissure) disappeared, which was one slice (0.6 mm) after disappearance of the uncus. Approximately the four most posterior EC slices (∼2.4 mm) were fully covered by pm-EC. 

Al-EC and pm-EC masks as well as the whole brain T1-template are available online in original ( ; resolution: 0.6 mm  isotropic) and MNI space ( ; resolution: 2 mm  isotropic). Furthermore, location of al-EC and pm-EC in relation to PRC, PHC and proximal vs distal subiculum is visualized in  . 




## Discussion 
  
We report the first detailed topographic parcellation of the human EC on the basis of its functional connectivity with neocortical and hippocampal subregions. In two independent samples, our analyses revealed that anterior-lateral and posterior-medial EC subregions (al-EC and pm-EC, respectively) exhibited distinct patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity with regions in the neocortex (PRC and PHC) and hippocampal formation (subiculum). Specifically, the al-EC region could be delineated on the basis of preferential connectivity with PRC, whereas the borders of pm-EC were derived from connectivity with PHC. Al-EC and pm-EC, in turn, were found to have preferential connectivity with proximal and distal subiculum, respectively. Moreover, the pattern of subiculum connectivity with al-EC and pm-EC was partially distinct from its connectivity with PRC and PHC. A schematic summary of functional connectivity gradients in the subiculum related to PRC/PHC seeds and EC subdivisions is illustrated in  . These results reveal the functional topography of the human EC as a gateway between neocortex and hippocampus and show remarkable accordance with principles known from anatomical studies of rodents (rostrolateral vs caudomedial; for reviews see  ;  ) and studies of nonhuman primates (anterolateral vs posteromedial; see e.g.,  ;  ). As we describe below, these data provide a link between basic and translational research on the human medial temporal lobes ( ;  ) and results from detailed circuit level analyses of the rodent hippocampal formation (e.g.,  ).    Schematic summary of functional connectivity gradients in the subiculum related to PRC/PHC seeds and EC subdivisions.  
(  A  ) Functional connectivity analyses revealed preferential connectivity of PRC (red) with the anterior-lateral EC and PHC (blue) with the posterior-medial EC. Regarding the subiculum, PRC showed strongest connectivity with most anterior and proximal parts, whereas PHC showed strongest connectivity with most posterior and distal parts of the subiculum. (  B  ) Anterior-lateral (red) and posterior-medial (blue) EC exhibited a similar dissociation in connectivity with the subiculum along its transverse (proximal-distal) axis but there was no trend for a dissociation of entorhinal connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the subiculum.

Previous fMRI studies have used functional connectivity analyses on data collected at 3T to characterize topographic patterns of connectivity between the PRC, PHC, and hippocampal subfields ( ;  ). These studies have generally found that PRC and PHC exhibit different patterns of connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. Unfortunately, these studies could not address the topographic organization of connectivity within the EC, possibly due to limitations in resolution and SNR. The present results demonstrate that the enhanced resolution and sensitivity of ultra-high field fMRI can overcome these limitations and reveal fine-grained topographical patterns in connectivity. Three-dimensional plots of entorhinal connectivity preferences revealed a gradient of decreasing PRC and increasing PHC connectivity running from anterior-lateral to posterior-medial EC. It is notable that, by training a pattern classifier on the coordinates of EC voxels that showed preferential connectivity with PRC or PHC within a subset of participants, we could reliably predict these voxels in the remaining participant. This finding indicates that the topography of neocortical connectivity within the EC is highly conserved across participants, which, in turn, could indicate fundamental functional differences between the two EC subdivisions. 

Two recent fMRI studies reported evidence for task-related activation differences between lateral and medial sections of EC in humans ( ;  ). Schultz and colleagues (2012) reported differential activation in medial and lateral sections of EC during scene and face processing in a working memory task. Reagh and Yassa reported preferential activation in a medial section of EC during mnemonic discrimination of spatial locations and preferential activation in a lateral section of EC during mnemonic discrimination of objects. This functional dissociation was observed by splitting the EC into equally-sized lateral and medial parts according to the rodent terminology of ‘LEC’ and ‘MEC’. Notably, they also found a trend towards a dissociation between anterior and posterior EC after a similar equal division along the longitudinal axis. Our data help to explain these findings by empirically demonstrating that al-EC and pm-EC exhibit differential functional connectivity with PRC and PHC. Numerous fMRI studies have shown that PHC is preferentially engaged in memory tasks that involve scenes, spatial or context information, whereas PRC is preferentially engaged in memory tasks that involve object or item information (see  ;  ; for review). Thus, it makes sense that EC subregions that interact predominantly with PRC or PHC also differentially participate in item and context processing. However, our data also suggest that a simple lateral-medial distinction does not capture the functional organization of EC. Future fMRI studies (as well as structural MRI studies, e.g.,  ) could more effectively study the EC by using the high-consistency pm-EC and al-EC masks derived from our data (see also ‘Landmarks for delineation of al-EC and pm-EC’), or by using functional connectivity metrics to identify subject-specific EC subregions. 

Concurrent with our investigation, Navarro Schröder and colleagues ( ) also studied the functional organization of the human EC. Whereas the present study focused on MTL connectivity, their study focused on functional connectivity of the EC with large-scale cortical networks. Consistent with our study, they also differentiated between anterior-lateral and posterior-medial EC subregions based on differential global network connectivity in resting state and task fMRI data ( ). They found that the al-EC exhibited stronger connectivity with regions in an anterior-temporal cortical system including medial-prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, whereas the pm-EC exhibited stronger connectivity with regions in a posterior-medial system including regions in occipital and posterior-parietal cortex. Analyses of task fMRI data revealed that al-EC activity was enhanced during processing of object information and pm-EC activity was enhanced during processing of scenes. Their findings are consistent with the idea that al- and pm-EC may be related to two cortico-hippocampal networks that support distinct types of memory ( ;  ). 

Although the EC is a major gateway for the hippocampus, neocortical regions such as PRC and PHC also have direct reciprocal connectivity with CA1 and subiculum ( ,  ;  ). Our analyses revealed that the topographic differences in subicular connectivity with PRC vs PHC along the hippocampal transverse axis paralleled the differences of subicular connectivity with al-EC vs pm-EC. Whereas al-EC and PRC showed stronger connectivity with proximal subiculum, pm-EC and PHC showed stronger connectivity with distal subiculum. In contrast to the transverse axis, PRC/PHC vs al-EC/pm-EC connectivity profiles differed along the longitudinal hippocampal axis. For al-EC and pm-EC, there was no evidence or trend for an anterior-posterior dissociation, compatible with connectivity of LEC and MEC in rodents ( ,  ;  ;  ). In contrast, the most anterior subiculum showed stronger connectivity with PRC than PHC, whereas in one data set the most posterior subiculum (in the hippocampal body [HB]) showed stronger connectivity with PHC than PRC. This finding replicated the direct anatomical connectivity profiles observed in rodents ( ,  ;  ). Such an anterior-posterior dissociation of hippocampal connectivity accords with findings from human resting-state fMRI studies that investigated functional connectivity profiles of PRC and PHC (rather than EC) with hippocampal subfields ( ). 

These functional connectivity data suggest that there might be two parallel cortico-hippocampal pathways in humans — one via the EC and one that is direct. The differences in the topographic organization of EC-subicular connectivity and PRC/PHC-subicular connectivity could have important functional implications. One implication is that the EC is not a simple anatomical extension of the PRC and PHC. If that were the case, we would not have observed any reliable difference between neocortical-hippocampal connectivity profiles and EC-hippocampal connectivity profiles. These results add support to the notion that the EC is more than a mere cortico-hippocampal relay (e.g.,  ;  ). One possibility is that this organization might allow a comparison between EC-gated hippocampal memory signals with direct neocortical input (e.g.,  ). Furthermore, the diffuse nature of LEC/MEC projections along the anterior-posterior hippocampal axis and a structured gradient of direct PRC/POR projections that has been identified in rodents could allow for integration of information across both processing streams ( ;  ;  ). 

Results from the present study may be pertinent to understanding memory impairment in clinical conditions that compromise the structural integrity of the medial temporal lobes, including neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, temporal lobe epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, developmental amnesia and ischemia. In AD, for instance, tau pathology emerges in lateral regions of the EC early in the course of the disease ( ;  ). Analyses of functional connectivity can potentially reveal how EC degeneration in the early stages of AD could impact the functional organization of distributed cortical networks ( ; also see;  ) and also shed light on the transsynaptic progression of pathology in AD. 

To summarize, the results of the present study provide a detailed description of the organization of functional connectivity within the human EC. Based on differential functional connectivity with PRC, PHC and subicular subregions, our data, along with those of Navarro Schröder et al. (in review), demonstrate that the human EC can be reliably subdivided into anterior-lateral and posterior-medial subregions that could be critical nodes in two cortico-hippocampal processing pathways. Future studies can apply the high resolution functional connectivity analyses to differentiate the roles of al-EC and pm-EC in memory and alterations of EC connectivity in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Two independent samples of 21 and 22 young, healthy subjects underwent high resolution fMRI scanning (Exp. 1: mean age 26 ± 3.6 yrs, 12 male; Exp. 2: mean age 28 ± 3.9 yrs, 7 male). Exclusion criteria were metallic implants (other than standard dental implants), tinnitus, known metabolic disorders or a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Both studies were approved by the local ethics committee of the University Magdeburg. All subjects gave written informed consent and consent to publish prior to participation and received monetary compensation for participation. Six subjects from Experiment 1 and six from Experiment 2 were excluded due to strong dropouts in the PRC and/or EC or due to severe movement artifacts. Functional connectivity analyses were performed on the residuals of task data after extraction of task effects (N  = 15, N  = 14). 


### Tasks 
  
#### Experiment 1 (encoding of novel vs familiar images of scenes) 
  
During the fMRI session, subjects performed an incidental visual encoding paradigm. In 1 run, 120 new images (60 indoor and 60 outdoor), 60 ‘noise’ images and 60 repetitions of one familiar image were presented randomly. The familiar image and the ‘noise’ images were familiarized using 10 repetitions each directly before the functional MR scan. Subjects made an indoor/outdoor judgment for each image by button press (for more details, see  ). 


#### Experiment 2 (Differentiation of original images and similar lures) 
  
During fMRI data acquisition subjects performed an explicit mnemonic discrimination task. Stimuli were presented in short sequences consisting of 3–5 stimulus presentations of the same two stimuli (two similar versions of the same indoor scene). Sequences were presented in an event-related design. Each stimulus was presented for 3 s and stimuli were separated by a presentation of a scrambled noise picture for 3.5 s to prevent after-image or pop-out effects. Sequences were separated by a presentation of a fixation star for 4 s. Subjects had to keep the first stimulus of each sequence (target) in mind and indicate the third presentation of this exact stimulus via button press with their right index finger. 



### Data acquisition and preprocessing 
  
MRI data were acquired using a 7T MR system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). A 32-channel head coil was used (Nova Medical, Willmington, MA). First, a high-resolution whole head MPRAGE volume (TE = 2.8 ms, TR = 2500 ms, TI = 1050 ms, flip angle = 5°, resolution 0.6 mm isotropic) was acquired. 

Subsequently, the fMRI session was run. T2*-weighted gradient echo planar images (EPIs) were acquired with an isotropic resolution of 0.8 mm (28 axial slices, TE = 22 ms, TR = 2000 ms, FOV 205 mm, matrix 256 × 256, partial Fourier 5/8, parallel imaging with grappa factor 4, bandwidth 1028 Hz/Px, echo spacing 1.1 ms, echo train length 40, flip angle 90°). The slices were acquired in an odd–even interleaved fashion oriented parallel to the hippocampus long axis. The fMRI session comprised 1 run (13 min) with 370 EPI volumes in Experiment 1 and 4 runs (13.5 min each) with 400 EPI volumes in Experiment 2. EPIs were distortion corrected using a point spread function mapping method ( ) and motion corrected during the online reconstruction. 

Finally, a high-resolution partial structural volume was acquired (T2*-weighted imaging, TE = 18.5 ms, TR = 680 ms, resolution 0.33 mm × 0.33 mm, 45 slices, slice thickness 1.5 mm + 25% gap, FOV 212 mm × 179 mm, matrix 640 × 540), with a slice alignment orthogonal to the hippocampus main axis. 

Total MRI duration was around 60 min in Experiment 1 and 100 min in Experiment 2. 

FMRI data pre-processing and statistical modeling was done in SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College, London, UK). The pre-processing included slice timing correction and smoothing with a 1.5 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel (FWHM < 2 × voxel size) to keep high anatomical specificity. Outliers in average intensity and/or scan-to-scan motion were identified using the   ARTRepair toolbox   for SPM (Percent threshold in global intensity: 1.3, movement threshold: 0.3 mm/TR) and included as spike regressors. 

To remove task effects, general linear models were run (including all task conditions and the movement parameters) and the residual images were saved for subsequent intrinsic functional connectivity analyses. Based on previous studies suggesting a linear superposition of task activity and spontaneous BOLD fluctuations, removing task-induced variance of event-related fMRI data should yield a remaining residual signal similar to ‘continuous’ resting state data (e.g.,  ). Although quantitative differences between residuals derived from task data and continuous resting state data have been reported ( ), in qualitative terms, patterns of functionally connected regions have been shown to be remarkably consistent ( ;  ). 


### Segmentation of regions of interest 
  
In order to analyze PRC vs PHC seed-to-voxel connectivity, we manually segmented PRC and PHC regions of interest (ROIs) for each subject on the individual high resolution MPRAGEs (which had been bias-corrected and coregistered to the individual mean EPIs). Furthermore, the EC and the subiculum were labelled on the T1-group template in order to analyze PRC vs PHC connectivity topography within the EC and al-EC vs pm-EC as well as PRC vs PHC connectivity topography within the subiculum, respectively, at group level (individual beta-maps were registered to the template). ROIs were traced on consecutive coronal slices bilaterally using MRIcron (Chris Rorden, Version 4 April 2011). 

Tracing of the EC started anteriorly at the first slice where the amygdala was visible. Caudally the EC moves along the parahippocampal gyrus until the collateral sulcus disappeared ( ), typically at the level where also the HH ends, merging into the PHC. At anterior levels, the EC borders the amygdala nuclei medially ( ). When the gyrus ambiens disappears and the hippocampal fissure opens, the EC borders the parasubiculum medially. This EC-subiculum boundary was located at the angle formed by the most medial extent of both subiculum and EC ( ). The opening of the collateral sulcus typically coincides with the lateral border of the EC ( ), and was chosen as lateral limit. The PRC, which laterally abuts the EC, was defined as the region between the medial and lateral edges of the collateral sulcus (covering medial and lateral banks). Contrary to other markings schemes for the EC and PRC ( ), we did not mark the part of the EC within medial banks of the collateral sulcus that depends on the depth of the collateral sulcus, since this border shows remarkable within and between subject variability and is also sometimes difficult to identify due to partially occurring susceptibility artefacts. For the purpose of the current study, we further deleted PRC mask voxels that were directly neighbored to the EC/PRC border (leaving a gap of approx. 2 voxels ∼1 mm) to avoid autocorrelations between PRC seed voxels and our target EC ROI. Segmentation of the PHC started one slice after the disappearance of the collateral sulcus, directly posterior to PRC and EC (approx. at the level where the HB starts). Labeling was continued posteriorly, ending on the last slice where the inferior and superior colliculi were jointly visible. The PHC was delineated as the region between subiculum (medial border) and the deepest point of the collateral sulcus ( ). 

The subiculum was labeled on the T1-template (0.8 mm isotropic resolution) in the HH and body (until the colliculi disappeared) according to the segmentation protocol of ( ). Note that we did not segment the hippocampal tail as borders were difficult to identify. For division of EC and subiculum masks into anterior-posterior and lateral-medial or proximal-distal subregions, see ‘Second Level Analyses’ (Univariate). 

Subsequently, PRC and PHC masks were coregistered and resliced to the individual mean EPI images and manually adjusted to achieve a precise overlay on the functional data. To exclude voxels susceptible to signal dropout, for each ROI, voxels with mean intensity (across timepoints) < 2 SD from the mean intensity (across voxels) in an ROI were removed from the ROI ( ). Thresholding led to the rejection of no more than 5% of voxels in any ROI. Additionally, areas of PRC were occasionally subject to distortion artifact, and these voxels were manually deleted from ROIs. These adjusted and thresholded ROIs were used as seed regions for the functional connectivity analyses. 

Probabilistic white matter (WM) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) masks were generated by automated segmentation (SPM8, ‘New Segment’) of the co-registered MPRAGE images and thresholded at p(tissue) > 0.95. 


### First-level functional connectivity analyses 
  
We performed seed-to-voxel correlational analyses on the native (preprocessed, unnormalized) residual fMRI data using the   conn-toolbox   ( ). First, functional connectivity patterns of PRC vs PHC seeds with the EC were analyzed. For each functional connectivity analysis, seed regions' average time series were generated as regressors of interest. As covariates of no interest, WM and CSF time series and subjects' realignment parameters (including spike regressors) were included to account for physiological noise and movements, respectively. Functional data were band-pass filtered for frequencies of 0.01–0.1 Hz. Bivariate correlations were computed, resulting in beta maps containing Fisher-transformed correlation coefficients. To perform group analyses, beta maps were registered to the group-specific T1 template (see below) and Z-standardized. 


### Cross-participant alignment for group analyses 
  
In order to enable precise cross-participant alignment for hippocampal and parahippocampal regions, we used Region of Interest-Advanced Normalization Tools (ROI-ANTS [ ;  ;  ]). 

First, the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) software library (FSL 5.0.6 [ ]) was used to register each single participant's structural MPRAGE and the mean functional EPI using epi_reg, a command-line program that belongs to the FMRIB's linear registration tool (FLIRT v6.0 [ ]) and was specifically written to register EPI images to structural images. 

Second, a study-specific template was created (from individual MPRAGE images of Exp. 1) using the buildtemplateparallel.sh command-line script within ROI-ANTS (Cross-Correlation similarity metric [ ]). Although the resulting alignment parameters already allow for a good registration to the template, we further improved normalization for the MTL regions by adding landmarks to the template. Therefore, the HH (on the first slice on which it appears), EC (on the first four consecutive slices, starting on the HH slice), the HB and the PHC (same slices as HB) were labeled on the T1-template as landmarks for the subsequent label-guided alignment. Similarly, subject-specific ROIs were drawn on the individual MPRAGEs to match the template priors. 

Third, the expectation-based point set registration (‘pse’; step size: SyN[0.5]) was used to register the individual MPRAGEs on the T1-template based on the labeled points sets (= MTL masks). The resulting transformation matrix was then applied to each participant's beta map as well as to the MTL masks in order to verify alignment precision. Finally, the aligned beta images were submitted to second-level group analyses. 


### Second-level analyses 
  
#### Univariate 
  
First, we calculated single-seed group connectivity maps using voxelwise one-sample t-tests to characterize the intrinsic connectivity profiles of PHC and PRC with EC (  and  ). Additionally, paired t-tests were performed to determine significant differences in PRC vs PHC connectivity ( ). Resulting t-maps were masked with the EC ROI and significant clusters determined by cluster-extent based thresholding (Z > 2.3; p  < 0.05). In addition, we visualized the differential topographic pattern of PRC vs PHC connectivity along the x-y-z direction in three-dimensional plot of connectivity preference for each voxel (see  ). These analyses indicated relatively stronger connectivity of the PRC with the anterior-ventral-lateral EC and stronger connectivity of the PHC with the posterior-dorsal-medial EC. 

In a next step, to directly test for significant differences between anterior/posterior and lateral/medial regions of the EC, we divided the template EC ROI into four equally-sized sections along the longitudinal and horizontal (or transverse) plane, corresponding to coronal and sagittal cuts, respectively. As mentioned previously, the planes are defined in reference to the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus (which also corresponds to the EC long-axis). The lateral vs medial division was performed for each coronal slice individually in order to ensure equally-sized portions along the longitudinal axis. Mean parameter estimates were extracted from each of the four subsections for each subject (from the group-registered beta maps). The resulting PRC and PHC connectivity estimates were submitted to a 2 × 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA with seed ROI (PHC vs PRC), longitudinal EC section (anterior vs posterior), and horizontal EC section (lateral vs medial) as factors. Furthermore, we assessed connectivity gradients across the longitudinal and horizontal axes by plotting slice-by-slice mean parameter estimates. As the number of transverse EC slices differed along the longitudinal axis (between 5 and 11 slices), we divided each coronal EC slice into 5 equal sections and calculated mean betas for each section. The same approach was used to test for differential connectivity of EC subregions and PRC/PHC with the subiculum along the longitudinal or transverse axis. 


#### Multivariate 
  
Finally, we used a multivariate classifier (linear CSVMC) to further investigate the reliability of the topography of PRC vs PHC preferential connectivity within the EC. A linear support vector machine classifier (Linear CSVMC,  ) was trained and tested on the x-y-z coordinates of all EC voxels across all subjects using PyMVPA 2.2.0 ( ). Independent data chunks were defined according to the individual subjects of each study. Each chunk consisted of the same amount of samples (EC voxels). For the purpose of evaluation of classification validity, a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was performed. In each of the validation steps, a linear support vector machine was trained on the data of all but one subject and tested on the remaining one. Accuracy of the validation step was calculated as the proportion of the samples (voxels) that were classified correctly (as being preferentially connected to PRC or PHC). Overall classification accuracy was defined as the mean accuracy of all validation steps across subjects. 

Mean classifier accuracy was tested for significance using non-parametric permutation testing. Over 1000 iterations, samples (EC voxels) of the training set were randomly relabeled and tested on the testing set using the same leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme as before, generating a non-parametric null distribution. Type I error rate was set at p < 0.001 based on this null distribution ( ). Classification and permutation testing were performed separately for the left and right hemisphere and separately for Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. In order to investigate the consistency of correct classifications for each voxel, we calculated the proportion of correct classifications for each voxel across subjects. Voxels with high consistency are often correctly classified across subjects whereas voxels with low consistency are rarely classified correctly.

# Title

Feedback on Trait or Action Impacts on Caudate and Paracingulum Activity

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
There is a general conception that positive associations to one’s trait, e.g. ‘I’m clever’, are beneficial for cognitive performance. Scientific evidence shows that this is a simplification. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we used written trial-based trait feedback ‘you are clever’, or task feedback ‘your choice was correct’, on each correct response of a rule-switching task, to investigate how the character of positive self-associations influences performance outcome. Twenty participants took part in this crossover design study. We found that trait feedback was less beneficial for motivation and performance improvement, and resulting in enhanced neural activation on more difficult bivalent rule trials. This indicates that the task was treated as more complex in this condition. For example, ‘you are clever’ feedback led to enhanced activation in anterior caudate nucleus, an area known to process uncertainty. We further observed that activation in anterior paracingulate cortex was sensitive to whether self-reflection was imposed by external feedback or generated from internal processes, where the latter activation correlated positively with performance when following after task feedback. Our results illustrate how feedback can evoke self-reflections that either help or hinder motivation and performance, most likely by impacting on processes of uncertainty. The results support social psychological models stipulating that trait focus take resources away from task focus.

## Introduction 
  
Self-reflection is an inherent trait in humans and is there to enable predictions about one’s behaviour so that one can regulate attention and make informed choices [ ]. In a review by Passingham et al., [ ], several examples from animal and human brain imaging studies were presented which showed that external signals activate partly different neural processes, and displays different anatomical connectivity profiles, than do internal self-reflective processes. While task processes take place in the lateral part of the cortex, internal processes are mainly processed on the medial surface. When performing a cognitive task, such as a rule-switching task where action relevant cues are visually presented, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is active primarily in the learning stage, whereas activity in neurons of the premotor cortices and caudate control the task once learned [ , ]. Likewise, there is now substantial support for a role for the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC) in processing abstract representations of abilities [ ]. When participants reflect upon whether a trait applies to themselves or not, aMPFC activity increases [ , ], or when trait words are processed as compared to non-trait words [ ]. 

Less is known about aMPFC activation during cognitive task performance. Having positive associations to one’s traits is regarded beneficial for performance with the argument that a positive self-view helps with persistence on a task when facing difficulties [ ]. A proposed mechanism is that believing in one’s abilities generates a self-fulfilling prophecy, which influences how we strive to achieve our goals [ ]. Similarly, associations to being intelligent have been found to increase the confidence in participants’ memory process, as opposed to associations to stupidity [ ]. Furthermore, it has been found that when participants believe that their trait is being evaluated, such as their intelligence, error-activation in the paracingulum of aMPFC increases when performing a working memory task [ , ]. This suggests that aMPFC plays a role in performance monitoring from a self-image perspective. 

However, these latter studies are inconclusive as to whether it is beneficial for performance accuracy to make associations with cleverness during task performance. In fact, negative effects on performance and motivation as a consequence of a positive self-view have been reported [ , ]. For example, a heightened self-view in the form of high achievement based self-esteem can be a factor behind burnout symptoms [ ]. Thus, it may be that the character of the positive self-association is important for performance outcome. There are two principal mind-sets regarding intelligence which have been proposed to be particularly relevant for task motivation and performance; the entity mind-set and the incremental mind-set [ ]. A person holding an entity mind-set perceives intelligence as something that is an unchangeable part of their character. An individual with an incremental mind-set on the other hand, regards intelligence as something that can vary with effort and training. In turn, an incremental mind-set gives rise to greater task motivation [ ], and greater performance improvements when retested [ ]. Studies on feedback have observed that praising intelligence can lead to reduced motivation, and task persistence [ , ]. Although there are several behavioural studies on the topic of praising trait and action, few studies have been looking at underlying neural mechanisms. In an EEG study it was found that having an entity mind-set was related to enhanced P3 response to performance-relevant feedback on errors as compared to incremental theorists. The error-related P3-peak was most likely stemming from aMPFC [ ]. 

Here we have extended the research to involve conflicts more generally by looking at correct trials using a rule-switching task [ ]. This task includes two levels of conflict; bivalent rules and univalent rules. In bivalent rule trials, a response symbol has different meanings dependent on the current rule active. It has been found that the response on bivalent correct trials, but not on univalent trials, were influenced by which ability priming (clever or stupid) the participants had received prior to the task [ ]. We therefore chose this particular task to study the effect of positive feedback related to trait and feedback related to choice of action. In this functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) study, we investigated if trait focus and task focus could be manipulated with feedback on correct responses in the rule-switching task. The aim was to study the impact of the feedback on perceived experience, performance accuracy, and neural processes with particular focus on the aMPFC. We used task feedback ‘your choice was correct’ that praised participants’ choice, and trait feedback ‘you are clever’ that praised participants’ intelligence in a within-subject design. We hypothesized that the trait feedback would evoke more focus on one’s character with increased neural activation in paracingulate cortex of aMPFC as a result [ , ], and lead to lowered motivation and performance [ , ]. Previous studies show that individuals prone to anxiety tend to fear social feedback [ ]. Other studies show that feedback is perceived differently in participants with incremental or entity views on intelligence [ ,  ]. We therefore also tested if self-esteem, mood, and growth mind-set influenced how the feedback was processed. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Twenty healthy participants (age 24±5.6, 8 females) were scanned with fMRI twice (18.5±6.45 days apart), in a crossover design. Two other participants were tested but excluded, one because of performance below chance-level, the other for attending only one session. 


### Ethical statement 
  
Participants gave written informed consent prior to testing. The study was approved by the local ethics committee in Stockholm (EPN), Sweden (Dnr 2014/10-31/2). Participants were neurologically healthy, right-handed, and with Swedish (n = 13) or English (n = 7) as their mother tongue. They performed the task in their native language. 


### Rule-switching task 
  
The participants took part in four scanning sessions, two sessions per visit, in a computer based rule-switching task [ ]. In the task, a rule symbol was presented on a computer screen for 1000ms, followed by a blank screen for 500ms before a response symbol appeared. During the presentation of the response symbol, the participants had a window of 2500ms to respond, and received feedback immediately after the motor response ( ). This was followed by jittered delay of 1.5, 4 or 6 sec before presentation of the next rule symbol. This jittered delay was introduced so as to separate (de-correlate) neural activations between the different trials, i.e. neural activations evoked by the feedback in one trial and the neural activations evoked by seeing the rule symbol in the consecutive trial. The participants responded to symbols that could be either univalent or bivalent by pressing the left or right button on a button box. The univalent trials were associated with fixed responses, e.g. when a symbol of a bow (rule symbol) is followed by a house (response symbol) a left key press is the correct answer, whereas a right key-press is correct when a bow is followed by a car ( ). Bivalent trials refer to visual pictures that were associated with different responses depending on one of the two rules possible. For example, if a rule symbol consisting of a square is followed by the response symbol of a butterfly, the participants should press the left button. On the other hand, if the rule symbol is a triangle and is followed by the same response symbol, a butterfly, the participant should press the right button (Fig   and  ). The task consisted of a distribution of 70% bivalent trials and 30% univalent trials with a distribution combination in accordance with earlier studies [ , ]. This distribution yields a fairly equal frequency of each rule; 35% presentations of each for the two bivalent rules (Fig   and  ), and a 30% occurrence of the univalent rule ( ). Univalent trials served as controls and were later in the fMRI analysis subtracted from bivalent trials in order to study brain activation related to conflicting trials. The univalent trials balance the comparisons for visual input, and motor output. In addition, by subtracting brain activation related to univalent rule trials from brain activation related to bivalent rule trials, for each participant at each visit, we reduce the influence of confounding effects, such as equipment and participant related effects, which may vary between the two scanning visits. The distribution of univalent and bivalent trials was identical between the two scanning visits. The participants were presented with a set of different symbols on each visit. 
   Rule-switching task.  
A) A univalent rule trial. A rule symbol is presented followed by one of two unique response symbols. B-C) Two bivalent rule trials. Two different rule symbols are used to determine the action to a subsequent response symbol. For example, when seeing the butterfly, either the left or the right key should be pressed depending on preceding rule symbol. A-C) The feedback presented was either task feedback ‘your choice was correct’ or trait feedback ‘you are clever’ for correct responses, and 'wrong' for incorrect responses. 
  
#### Practice 
  
The task, with feedback, was practiced for 12 trials on a PC computer in a testing room prior to fMRI scanning. If the participant’s accuracy was <60% they received task instructions again and practiced until achieving ≥60% correct. Two participants gave <60% correct responses on their first practice trial. Inside the scanner, the participants were familiarized with the button box and the visual display for another 12 trials before data collection started. 


#### Feedback 
  
Each scanning visit comprised of a feedback session (FS) followed by a no feedback session (NFS). During the FS, the feedback was presented immediately after each key-press. The feedback was either task feedback ‘Your choice was correct’/’Du valde rätt’ (Swedish), or trait feedback ‘You are clever’/‘Du är smart’ (Swedish) for corrects and ‘Wrong’/‘Fel’ (Swedish) for incorrect responses. During the NFS there was no feedback given neither on corrects nor on errors. The FS consisted of 100 trials and the NFS consisted of 50 trials. Only one of the feedbacks was given per visit. The order of which feedback type (task/trait) was received on their first and second visit was counterbalanced among participants. The consequence of the counterbalance is that the time confound of NFS always following FS does not affect the comparison between the two feedback conditions ‘You are clever’ and ‘Your choice was correct’. Moreover, the identical number of trials between the two feedback conditions, and the fact that we analyze the data with a 2x2 ANOVA, gives the unequal number of presentations between FS and NFS, and univalent and bivalent trials, negligible impact on the results [ ]. 



### Questionnaires 
  
A minimum of one day before the experiment (mean 6.5±9.2 days), all participants filled in the following questionnaires using Google forms; Burns depression inventory [ ] and Rosenberg self-esteem score [ ], and four selected questions regarding intelligence mind-set orientation [ ]. The assessment of mind-set was calculated by subtracting the scores of the two entity questions from the scores of two incremental questions. The questions were answered by numbers 1–6; 1-Strongly disagree, 6-strongly agree. After subtraction, negative scores indicated agreement with an incremental mind-set and positive scores indicated agreement with entity mind-set. 


### Motivation ratings 
  
At three times during scanning, the participants rated their motivation, stress, and task difficulty by answering three questions asked by the experimenter; How motivated are you to continue with the task?; How stressed do you feel right now?; How difficult did you find the task? Ratings were of 1–10; 1-very calm/unmotivated/easy, 10-very stressed/motivated/difficult. The questions were asked before the cognitive task, after FS, and after NFS (difficulty ratings were not given before the task). These are presented in  . After the experiment, the participants wrote down how they experienced the feedback during the different sessions with the questions; What did you think about the test with feedback? What did you think about the test without feedback? They were subsequently debriefed about the purpose of the experiment. 
   Behavioural data.        

### Behavioural Data Analysis 
  
The data was presented using Cogent software (UCL, London, UK) which is running in Matlab (r2010a, The Math Works, MA, USA). Accuracy (% correct), reaction time (RT), motivation scores, stress scores, and difficulty scores were analysed with repeated measures ANOVAs, and Student’s paired t-tests for post-hoc comparisons in SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA). We report behavioural results from a 2x2 repeated measure ANOVA with the factors feedback (task/trait) and time (FS/NFS). All the behavioural analyses were controlled for the order of which the participants received each feedback type (day of testing). We further investigated if there were any correlations between the outcome measures; accuracy, RT for correct responses, motivation scores and the Burns/Rosenberg questionnaires, using Pearson correlations in SPSS. 


### Imaging acquisition 
  
Functional imaging data were acquired using a 3T GE scanner (Discovery MR750, GE). Functional images sensitive to blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrasts were acquired using echo-planar imaging as T2*-weighted images. Whole brain image volumes were built up from contiguous oblique slices (n = 40), flip angle 90°, TR = 2600ms; TE = 30ms; FOV 28,8cm; matrix size 64*64; voxel size 2x2x2mm, slice thickness 3.0mm with 0.5mm gap. A high-resolution 3D gradient-echo, T1-weighted anatomical image was also collected for each participant. We used an 8-channel head coil. 


### Brain imaging data analysis 
  
The fMRI data was analysed in SPM12b ( , London, UK) [ ]. The first six volumes were discarded and the remaining volumes realigned to the first volume to correct for head movements. Subsequently, the volumes were co-registered and normalized to standard space using the Montreal Neurological Institute reference brain. The time series were smoothed spatially with an isotropic Gaussian filter of 8 mm full width at half-maximum. 

The fMRI data was modeled as an event-related design with regressors corresponding to bivalent, univalent, correct, and incorrect trials for the conditions with immediate feedback (trait/task) (FS) and for the subsequent conditions without feedback (NFS), for each scanning visit. The events of the trials (bivalent/univalent and correct/incorrect) were time-locked to the presentation of the rule symbol, and the key response. 

Whole brain statistical parametric maps were calculated for these event-related condition-specific effects with the general linear model. The vectors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function, and the data were high-pass filtered with a frequency cut-off of 128 sec. 

The subject-specific effects were taken up to a second-level full-factorial analyses based on summary statistics from the contrast-images created on the first level, using 2 factors with 2 levels each; rule (univalent/bivalent) and condition (task/trait). Due to the low number of error trials we excluded the factor outcome. 

We investigated the main effect of bivalent trials, main effect of condition (task/trait), and interactions between rule (bivalent/univalent) and condition (task/trait) where we present both cross-over (co) and one-way (ow) results. This was done for both the FS and the NFS. We also investigated the interaction between condition (task/trait) and time (FS/NFS). The analyses were focused on the event that was locked to the time of seeing the rule symbol, as well as at the time of pressing the key i.e. seeing the feedback. 

We also investigated if BOLD was related to motivation scores, stress scores, difficulty scores as measures in between the FS and NFS, and performance accuracy for the following conditions: BOLD at the event of seeing the bivalent rule symbol, and at the event of seeing the feedback, in the trait feedback and task feedback conditions during the FS and NFS. For this purpose, we added each rating separately as a covariate in second level SPM analyses. Because we tested four different outcome measures, we then corrected the p-values for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni’s corrections. 

In order to test for significance, we carried out whole brain Family Wise Error corrected statistics (p<0.05) ( ). In  , we also present results on p<0.001 uncorrected level. To investigate if the activations found on the uncorrected level fell within task specific areas, we applied a mask generated from the activation pattern of the contrast: Main effect Rule (bivalent vs univalent) whole brain corrected. To test the hypothesis of feedback sensitive activity in aMPFC we carried out restricted region of interest (ROI) analyses based on previous findings of paracingulate cortex (-10 50 30) [ , ]. We report results corresponding to ROIs in the shape of a sphere with a radius 6mm, p-value <0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons (FWE). Anatomical locations were verified using the atlas of Duvernoy [ ].

## Results 
  
### Behavioural results 
  
#### Questionnaires 
  
We found a correlation between Burns depression scores and Rosenberg self-esteem scores (Pearson correlations, r = 0.87, p = 0.001) where the lower the self-esteem the more negative mood. When correlating ratings on Burns depression inventory and Rosenberg’s self-esteem scale with motivation ratings during the scanning, performance accuracy, or RT, we did not find any significant correlations (Pearson correlations r<0.1, p>0.05). When analyzing participants’ incremental and entity views on intelligence we found twelve participants holding an incremental view and seven participants holding an entity view. One participant got a score of zero, meaning neither nor. There was no significant interaction between mind-set and feedback on accuracy (F  = 0.387, p = 0.543, two-tailed), nor RT, (F  = 0.861 p = 0.769, two-tailed). There was a significant interaction between mind-set and feedback when looking at motivation (F  = 6.040, p = 0.026, two-tailed). Motivation score in participants with an entity mind-set was 5.43±3.04 after trait-feedback (FS) and 8.14±1.86 after action feedback (FS) (t  = 2.03, p = 0.09, two-tailed). Motivation score in participants with an incremental mind-set was 7.25±2.05 after trait feedback (FS) and 6.91±2.15 after action feedback (FS), (t  = 0.87, p = 0.4, two-tailed). 


#### Accuracy 
  
The behavioural data revealed a significant effect of time (FS or NFS) on accuracy (F  = 6,24, p = 0.02, Fig   and  ). The post-hoc analysis showed that accuracy was higher in the NFS than the FS both in the trait-feedback sessions (t  = 4.7, p = 0.017) and in the task-feedback sessions (t  = 2.6, p = 0.0001). Overall, accuracy was significantly higher for univalent trials compared to bivalent trials trials during FS (F  = 31.18, p = 0.001) and during NFS (F  = 8.796, p = 0.008) ( ). We observed an effect of feedback when looking at accuracy improvement (NFS accuracy—FS accuracy) from FS to NFS, over all correct trials (Fig   and  ). Task-feedback lead to a greater improvement than trait-feedback when looking at time(FS/NFS)*feedback (task/trait), (F  = 3.550, p = 0.038, one-sided), where task-feedback had an average increase of 6.4% SD±6.5, and trait-feedback gave an increase of 3.8% SD±6.0. Looking only at the bivalent trials, again there was a significant improvement in favour of task feedback (time(FS/NFS)*feedback (task/trait), F  = 3.907, p = 0.032, one-sided). This effect was absent for univalent trials (time(FS/NFS)*feedback (task/trait), F  = 0.423, p = 0.26, one-sided) ( ).

A) Both feedback conditions resulted in performance improvement from FS to NFS. B) Task-feedback led to greater improvement compared to trait-feedback (NFS vs. FS). C) The participants were more motivated to continue with the task after task-feedback compare to trait-feedback. 
  

#### Reaction time 
  
There was a significant effect of time (FS/NFS) on RT for correct responses (F  = 29.32, p = 0.0001). RT was slower in FS than NFS for both task and trait-feedback. Bivalent trials were slower than univalent trials in FS (F(2,18) = 51.1, p = 0.001), but there was no difference between bivalent and univalent trials in NFS (F(2,18) = 0.34, p = 0.57). There was a trend for a difference between condition (task/trait) and trial type (bivalent/univalent) (F(1,18) = 3.305, p = 0.086, two-sided), where the participants tended to slow the bivalent trials in the trait feedback condition ( ). 


#### Motivation ratings 
  
There was a main effect of feedback on motivational scores (F  = 6.244, p = 0.022). After the task-feedback FS, motivation scores were significantly higher than after trait-feedback FS (task-feedback: 7.4±2.03; trait-feedback 6.65±2.50, F  = 6.2, p = 0.01,one-tailed) ( ). There was no main effect of time (FS/NFS) on motivational scores (F  = 0.71, p = 0.50), nor a difference in motivation before the scanning started between the two visits (t( ) = 1.65, p = 0.21) ( ). 


#### Stress ratings 
  
There was a significant effect of feedback on stress scores as measured after the FS and NFS (F  = 14.69, p = 0.001), where task-feedback induced less stress than trait-feedback. There was also a significant interaction between feedback and order (F  = 12.13, p = 0.003), where stress scores were higher on the first visit both after FS and NFS compared to the second visit, when receiving trait-feedback. There was no effect of time (FS/NFS) on stress scores (F  = 2.355, p = 0.13). 


#### Difficulty ratings 
  
There was no effect of feedback on difficulty scores, (F  = 0.22, p = 0.65), nor time (FS/NFS) (F  = 1.32, p = 0.27). 


#### Debriefing 
  
The following data was revealed from the debriefing about feedback experiences. In regard to task-feedback (FS), 75% of the participants were positive, 20% negative, and 5% neutral. In regard to NFS following the task-feedback, 70% were positive, 25% negative, and 5% neutral. In regard to trait-feedback (FS), 30% were positive, 45% negative, and 25% neutral. In regard to NFS following trait-feedback, 60% were positive, 20% negative, and 20% neutral. Thus, trait related feedback was most disliked. Positive views typically included ‘nice’, ‘motivating’, or ‘it was good’. Negative views typically included ‘distracting’, ‘annoying’, or ‘repetitive’. 


#### Brain activation 
  
The left anterior caudate nucleus was more active at the event of seeing the bivalent rule symbol in the FS in the condition where the participants were presented with the feedback ‘you are clever’, as compared to the condition where they received the feedback ‘your choice was correct’. This was revealed both in a cross-over and in a one-way analysis between rule (bivalent vs. univalent) and condition (trait vs. task) (24 20 18, t = 5.39, p = 0.014; -22 18 -12, t = 5.09, p = 0.036 FWE whole brain corrected) ( ,  ). Brain activations at a lower statistical threshold (p<0.001 uncorrected) are presented in  . We note that caudate activation was not seen to differ between the two feedback types when contrasting FS bivalent trials to NFS bivalent trials (trait [FS-NFS] vs. task [FS-NFS] and vice versa) ( ). This suggests that the effect of feedback is more pronounced on bivalent trials and less so on univalent trials. This finding is in line with the accuracy and RT data, which show feedback dependent differences for bivalent trials but not univalent trials.

A) Activity increased at the event of seeing the bivalent rule symbols in FS for ‘you are clever’. B) % BOLD signal change for each condition and rule type. 
  
None of the ratings regarding perceived quality (stress/motivation/difficulty) correlated with BOLD in this area for the feedback condition ‘you are clever’. 

When investigating activity of the paracingulate cortex of aMPFC specifically, again we found increased activation in particular when the rule symbol was presented for the feedback condition ‘you are clever’. Seeing the rule symbol during the FS was reflected as enhanced activity when investigating main effect trait vs. task (bivalent + univalent) (12 52 28, t = 2.46, p<0.05 corr 4mm ROI) (Fig   and  ). Seeing the rule symbol during the NFS was reflected as enhanced activity when investigating the interaction between rule (bivalent vs. univalent) and condition (trait vs. task) (6 50 26, t = 2.76, p<0.05 corr ROI), as well as in the simple contrast trait bivalent rule vs. trait univalent rule (6 50 28, t = 3.08, p<0.02 corr ROI). None of the quality ratings correlated with BOLD in this area for the condition ‘you are clever’. Instead, there was a significant positive correlation between BOLD and performance accuracy at the event of seeing the bivalent rule symbol, in the NFS following ‘your choice was correct’ (16 50 30, t = 4.26, p<0.008 Bonferroni corrected, ROI).

At the time of seeing the feedback, there was no activation surviving the conservative statistical threshold of correcting for multiple comparisons in the whole brain. We observe however, that at the threshold p<0.001 uncorrected, there is more activity when seeing the feedback ‘you are clever’ as compared to ‘your choice was correct’ ( ). Increased activations when seeing the feedback ‘you are clever’ vs. ‘your choice was correct’ in bivalent trials as compared to univalent trials, were found in right inferior frontal gyrus (48 32 -2, t = 3.32) and left superior temporal gyrus (-46 6 -10, t = 3.24). Increased activation when seeing the feedback ‘your choice was correct’ vs. ‘you are clever’ in bivalent trials as compared to univalent trials, was observed in cuneus (-8 -98 14, t = 3.25). In the NFS, at the time of the response, which is the time when the feedback was presented in the first part of the scanning session, activation increased in the visual cortex (anterior calcarine sulcus, -16 -46 8, t = 4.47) and cerebellum (-24 -48 -38, t = 3.32). This was seen for the contrast comparing activation during ‘you are clever’ to ‘your choice was correct’ in bivalent trials as compared to univalent trials. On the other hand, the condition ‘your choice was correct’ vs. ‘you are clever’ (bivalent trials vs. univalent trials) gave rise to left caudate (-10 12 18, t = 4.01) and left insular cortex (-40 18 12, t = 3.7) activation increase. 




## Discussion 
  
We found that trial-based written feedback influenced participants’ perceived experience and their performance. The participants were more motivated to continue with the task after the FS ‘your choice was correct’ than after the FS ‘you are clever’. They also perceived less stress in the ‘your choice was correct’ condition, and showed a significantly greater improvement in accuracy from FS to NFS. In the debriefing after the testing, nine of the participants expressed negative views about the feedback ‘you are clever’, whereas only four participants reported negative views about the task feedback. Thus, although both feedback types informed the participants about their correct outcome, the one addressing a trait gave rise to a more negative experience. This result is in line with a number of previous behavioural studies observing that trait-focused feedback has a negative effect on mainly motivation, but also on performance [ – , , ]. 

Interestingly, in the ‘you are clever’ condition we observed enhanced activation for the bivalent rule trials in particular. Mostly at the time when the bivalent rule symbol was presented. This means that the feedback-induced effects influence task monitoring. When looking at the simple, univalent trials the difference between the feedback types cease to appear. For example, we observed significantly greater activation in caudate nucleus for bivalent trials in the condition ‘you are clever’ than in the condition ‘your choice was correct’, but there was no difference between the two conditions when it came to the univalent trials. Related finding was made when looking at the behavioural data; RT and accuracy, where no difference was seen between feedback conditions in how univalent trials were treated, but more so when studying bivalent trials. We also looked at the bivalent trials during FS when using NFS bivalent trials as a control, to investigate if caudate was more active as a function of the actual feedback. There was no support for such a process, which strengthen the notion that more complex bivalent, rather than simple univalent trials, are targets for effects induced by the feedback. Similar observations have been made previously in that trait associations are particularly influential on neural activity and behaviour during events of uncertainty, such as errors or bivalent rule cues [ – , ]. The results suggest that the ‘You are clever’ feedback does not induce active and constant thoughts regarding one’s trait. Rather, it seems that the feedback influences processes that impacts on neurotransmitter levels so that, in moments of uncertainties, the neurons are signaling differently. The most likely neurons to be affected by the feedback are the one’s sensitive to dopamine. This is so because the caudate nucleus is known to innervate high densities of dopamine sensitive neurons [ , ] and uncertainty is reflected in dopamine signals [ ,  ]. 

Uncertainty is a measure of the quality of the participant’s own estimate of the data [ ]. Poor quality can be due to that not enough data has been collected [ ], or because of poor confidence in the memory for data presented [ ]. The latter would be the likely explanation in the present context as the two feedback conditions ‘You are clever’ and ‘Your choice was correct’ did not differ in the number of data presentations. Reduced confidence in memory could be due to factors such as anxiety, more demanding interpretation of the feedback, or deviation from task focus. Increased caudate activation has previously been observed when individuals anticipate the value of outcomes [ ], where participants with social anxiety show higher activation in caudate nucleus in anticipation to a performance outcome compared to controls [ , ]. Individuals may be more sensitive to information regarding their character (clever as opposed to correct action). According to the processing efficiency theory [ ], anxiety makes us use compensatory strategies, such as increased effort, in order to perform well. Another possibility to the observed feedback effects could be that the participants have to engage in a two-step interpretation process in the ‘you are clever’ condition. They need to translate ‘you are clever’ into ‘I made the correct choice’, which requires extra neuronal resources. It has previously been observed that trial-to-trial feedback with low additional information content distracts task attention [ ]. A third possible explanation to the observed effects of the feedback is that of a model in social psychology which proposes that attentional shift from action to trait leads to performance impairments due to reduced cognitive resources for the task [ ]. For example, working memory capacity has been found to be influenced by how we think about our abilities [ ]. Here, the authors induced the stereotypic belief that women are inferior to men in mathematics. Participants receiving the stereotypic framing in this study did not differ in math scores compared to a control group, but the men and women in the primed group took longer time on the math equations and had higher concerns about how the researcher would rate their performance compared to the control group. The main aim of the study however, was to look at how participants performed on a working memory task which was incorporated between the math equations. Results on the working memory task revealed that the women in the stereotypic group recalled fewer words when compared to a control group of women. This implies that the threat of belonging to a negative stereotype makes participants reflect upon themselves and their abilities, which then interferes with attentional resources needed for the working memory task. Furthermore, Bengtsson and Penny [ ] developed a model of the rule-switching task after participants had been primed with association to ‘clever’ and ‘stupid’. The model is based on the current understanding that neuronal populations estimate prior probabilities of outcomes and their expected value. In short, the model stipulates that the individual, by using Bayesian inference, attributes the probability of the cause of a response outcome (correct/error) to either a me-process or a task-process. Associations to ‘clever’ led to enhanced me-focus during correct responses. 

When investigating activity in paracingulate cortex, we made two observations. Firstly, we found that this area was more active in the ‘you are clever’ condition during the FS. Secondly, in the absence of feedback, in the NFS following ‘your choice was correct’, we found that participants’ performance accuracy correlated positively with BOLD here. These observations were made at the event when they were viewing the bivalent rule symbols. Our results strengthen the notion that this area is involved in self-focused processes during cognitive performance [ , ]. However, these new findings suggest that activation in paracingulate cortex is sensitive to whether external information about oneself is presented, or if the individual relies on internal self-monitoring. 

We further investigated if aspects such as self-esteem, mood, and growth mind-set impacted on how the feedbacks were processed. We found no support for that self-esteem or mood influenced the perception of the feedback. Nor did we observe any effects on accuracy and reaction time in the interactions between feedback and growth mind-set. We noted that there was a tendency for task feedback (your choice was correct) to be particularly beneficial for motivation in individuals with an entity view on intelligence. This could be interpreted in line with the predictions of Dweck et al., (2004) [ ] stipulating that entity theorists are more concerned about their outcome whereas incremental theorists are more interested in the knowledge acquired. Although what has been observed previously is a difference between the two mind-sets when processing negative feedback [ ]. The current sample sizes are very small and therefore we are making observations but not drawing any conclusions regarding how a growth mind-set is influencing this type of feedback. 

We made the decision to scan the participants with 2–3 weeks apart, randomly distributed between the two conditions. This time span was implemented to reduce the influence of the memory from previous visit on the current. It may be that the time factor influences the results because of for example equipment and participant related effects. However, in the brain imaging analysis, for each participant and visit, we subtracted brain activation related to univalent rules from brain activation related to bivalent rules, which lessens the influence of such confounding effects that may vary between the two scanning visits. 

### Conclusion 
  
This work sheds light on differences between the self-reflections; trait and action. It turned out that trait feedback was less beneficial for motivation and performance improvement. As a result, activity in caudate nucleus was enhanced in conflicting trials in the trait feedback condition particularly. We observed further that anterior paracingulate cortex activation was sensitive to whether self-reflection was imposed by external feedback or generated from internal processes, and that the latter activity supported performance when followed after task feedback. It should be noted however that these brain areas, which we found differentially active in the two feedback conditions, were most likely not directly differentiating between trait and action per se. Instead, their activation reflected the influence the feedback had on attention or task uncertainty.

# Abstract
 
The specific role of the amygdala remains controversial even though the development of functional imaging techniques has established its implication in the emotional process. The aim of this study was to highlight the sensitivity of the amygdala to emotional intensity (arousal). We conducted an analysis of the modulation of amygdala activation according to variation in emotional intensity via an fMRI event-related protocol. Monitoring of electrodermal activity, a marker of psychophysiological emotional perception and a reflection of the activation of the autonomic nervous system, was carried out concurrently. Eighteen subjects (10 men; aged from 22 to 29 years) looked at emotionally positive photographs. We demonstrated that the left and right amygdalae were sensitive to changes in emotional intensity, activating more in response to stimuli with higher intensity. Furthermore, electrodermal responses were more frequent for the most intense stimuli, demonstrating the concomitant activation of the autonomic nervous system. These results highlight the sensitivity of the amygdala to the intensity of positively valenced visual stimuli, and in conjunction with results in the literature on negative emotions, reinforce the role of the amygdala in the perception of intensity.

## Introduction 
  
One of the main challenges of neuroscience in the field of emotions is the modeling of anatomical structure and its functional response underlying emotional experience. The two main models of emotion, categorical, and dimensional, are each underpinned by neural and psychophysiological patterns consistent with and validated by numerous studies (Anderson et al.,  ; Dolcos et al.,  ; Lewis et al.,  ; Vytal and Hamann,  ). According to discrete emotion theory, each primary emotion has a constant and specific neural and psychophysiological pattern. The dimensional model involves attractive and repulsive systems. It defines emotions by two parameters: their valence (pleasant to unpleasant or positive to negative) and their intensity, also defined as arousal (calm to excited). 

The amygdala is an anatomical and functional crossroads in the emotional process of which the role has been studied by both the categorical and dimensional models of emotions. Initially, the amygdala was considered to be “the organ of fear” according to a categorical model (LeDoux,  ). Functional neuroimaging studies (mainly PET) then expanded the role of the amygdala to the recognition of unpleasant negative emotions (Morris et al.,  ; Lane et al.,  ; Paradiso et al.,  ). However, the development in functional imaging techniques has demonstrated that the amygdala may not only be specific to unpleasant stimuli. Indeed, the amygdala showed an activation in response to both pleasant and unpleasant stimuli (Anderson et al.,  ; Murphy et al.,  ; Small et al.,  ; Wager et al.,  ; Zald,  ; Winston et al.,  ; Costafreda et al.,  ; Sergerie et al.,  ; Ball et al.,  ; Costa et al.,  ; Morrison and Salzman,  ; Cunningham and Kirkland,  ). Additionally, a meta-analysis has highlighted the lack of specificity of the amygdala to a specific primary emotion (Sergerie et al.,  ). These results might be a reflection of the failure of the categorical model. 

The dimensional model now seems more appropriate in studying the role of the amygdala in emotion. The challenge was then to decide if the amygdala encodes information about valence or intensity of emotion. First, it has been shown that the amygdala is activated in correlation with the intensity of negative stimuli (Canli et al.,  ; Taylor et al.,  ). Then, studies have expanded the role of the amygdala to the perception of emotional intensity, irrespective of valence, in the chemosensory field, with olfactory and gustatory stimuli and with semantic stimuli (Anderson and Sobel,  ; Anderson et al.,  ; Small et al.,  ; Cunningham et al.,  ; Phan et al.,  ; Lewis et al.,  ; Costa et al.,  ). It is easier to control the variation of intensity regardless of valence in the chemosensory field rather than with visual stimuli, enabling the perception of intensity to be studied without bias related to variations in valence. Winston et al. demonstrated amygdala sensitivity to the intensity of olfactory stimuli with an extreme valence, but not to the intensity of stimuli of average valence (Winston et al.,  ). This suggests that the sensitivity of the amygdala to variations of emotional intensity might be dependent on valence. This explains why some authors have indicated that the amygdala might be a detector of emotional valence (Anders et al.,  ,  ). 

In regard to visual emotional stimulation, the most widely used stimuli are images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Each of these images is provided with a normalized value of valence (  from 1, very pleasant to 9, very unpleasant, with 5, neutral  ) and intensity (  from 1, very calm to 9, very excited  ). Now there is a link between valence and intensity. The more intense images are often the most pleasant or unpleasant. It follows that, in the field of visual emotional stimulation, it is difficult to vary the intensity regardless of the valence, which may cause bias in studies, leading to raising doubt about the sensitivity of the amygdala concerning levels of emotional intensity (Lane et al.,  ; Anders et al.,  ,  ) and about whether the amygdala encodes intensity or valence (Anders et al.,  ). However, it has been shown that increased amygdala activity is associated with greater arousal. This effect has been reported both when pleasant and unpleasant pictures were analyzed together and when just negative stimuli were analyzed (Lane et al.,  ; Garavan et al.,  ; Zald,  ). Moreover, some studies use neutral stimuli as references and base states to compare amygdala activation in response to positive and negative visual emotional stimuli. The amygdala is also activated, although more weakly, in response to “neutral” stimuli (valence around 5), such as faces or photographs (Taylor et al.,  ; Sergerie et al.,  ). So there could be some confusion in these studies between low intensity and neutrality of the valence (i.e., neither pleasant nor unpleasant) which is actually an average valence (valence around 5). To avoid bias it would be preferable to study positive and negative stimuli separately when using visual emotional stimuli from the IAPS. Numerous studies highlighted the role of the amygdala in the perception of the degree of emotional intensity in many other domains (Anderson and Sobel,  ; Anderson et al.,  ; Small et al.,  ; Cunningham et al.,  ; Phan et al.,  ; Costa et al.,  ). Demonstrating the sensitivity of the amygdala to variations in intensity of positively valenced pictures would enhance previous results in the literature in favor of the amygdala encoding intensity of emotions. 

The subject's perception of the two dimensions of valence and intensity in emotional feeling can be evaluated by self-scoring. Furthermore, emotions can be objectively evaluated by monitoring the autonomic nervous system (Lang et al.,  ; Anders et al.,  ; Kreibig,  ). Indeed, during the emotional process, the autonomic nervous system is activated. Electrodermal activity is a psychometric marker, indicating activation of the autonomic nervous system. It has been validated that its variations are correlated with the emotional intensity felt (Dawson et al.,  ). However, when used in fMRI studies, we can question whether the electrodermal reaction is the actual result of the emotional stimulation or a reaction to the noisy and stressful environment of the MRI scan. 

The aim of our study was to demonstrate the role of the amygdala in the perception of the intensity of pleasant emotions when using positively-valenced images without using negative emotional stimuli (unpleasant). In the MRI scanner, we simultaneously recorded electrodermal activity (EDA) in order to indicate the emotional intensity perceived by the subject. In order to control the effect of our stimuli, we replicated our protocol of emotional stimulation outside the scanner 1 month later to evaluate the effect of our stimuli, without the effect of the scanner. Our hypothesis is that increasing the intensity of positive visual emotional stimuli increases amygdala activation. This result should complement knowledge regarding negative as well as positive emotions in other domains (using olfactory, auditory, gustatory or semantic stimuli). We could then consider the fact that the human amygdala encodes the intensity of emotional stimuli whether positive or negative. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Eighteen healthy participants (10 men, all right handed, mean age 25 years, range 22–29) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and no history of neurological and psychiatric disorders, participated in this study. Written informed consent, as well as a safety-screening questionnaire to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), was obtained from each participant. The study received the approval of an Institutional Review Board (CPP   Est II  ). 


### Stimuli 
  
Stimuli were 75 positively valenced (IAPS ratings >4.6; mean = 5.90 ± 0.49) colored visual stimuli selected from the IAPS (Lang et al.,  ) (see Table   for a full description). We selected three groups of 25 images each, stratified according to their intensity based on the IAPS norms (Lang et al.,  ) (mean intensity ratings ± SD; low intensity = 2.77 ± 0.17; moderate intensity = 4.53 ± 0.30; and high intensity = 6.35 ± 0.3). We carefully matched these subsets with respect to semantic content, human faces and human figures, animals, and scenes. In addition, we ensured that IAPS valence ratings did not statistically differ between each group (Kruskall-Wallis test,   p   = 0.13). The mean luminance as well as the contrast of images were controlled. Every image was transformed so that the mean luminance of every group was equal. Mean luminance for the group of low intensity (respectively medium intensity, high intensity) was 87.0 (respectively 87.2, 89.5). As there were very little differences with the contrast (mean contrast (±SD) for the 75 images = 0.115 ± 0.003), no change was made for this parameter. No statistical difference was observed between groups for neither the “luminance” parameter, nor the contrast. From these 75 pictures, we planned to create three new groups of stimuli, according to the intensity ratings made by our subjects in this study. The analyses in this study were based on these three new groups of stimuli.

### Experimental procedure 
  
This study was composed of two sessions. In the first session, we used functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) to examine regional brain activity during a spontaneous emotion reactivity task. Our marker of autonomic activation was EDA, monitored in the scanner. We chose a passive task in order to avoid potential inhibition of amygdala activity by the prefrontal cortex because task instructions involving a form of attentional processing reduce the likelihood of amygdala activation compared to the passive processing of emotional stimuli (Hariri et al.,  ; Keightley et al.,  ; Taylor et al.,  ; Costafreda et al.,  ). Prior to the experimental session, subjects were familiarized with the stimuli by viewing 10 pictures from the IAPS, which were not included in the experiment. Participants were instructed to experience any feelings or thoughts the pictures might elicit in them. In the scanner, subjects saw pictures on a screen, positioned at the head of the scanner, via binoculars positioned on the head coil. Stimuli were applied using an event related design. Each picture was presented for 2 s. Stimulus presentation was jittered in time, with an inter-trial interval varying from 8 to 12 s (mean = 10 s). During the inter-trial interval, a black fixation cross on a white background remained on the screen and was our baseline condition. All stimuli were presented in a randomized order. Inter-trial interval was also randomized in order to maintain the subject's attention. The time interval between two events was chosen to allow the recording of peripheral physiological responses (Breska et al.,  ) as well as to allow blood flow to return to homeostatic levels. The task lasted about 15 min. 

In the second phase, 1 month later, the same participants performed the same paradigm, but outside the scanner. After this second session, all stimuli were presented in a second pass where subjects rated how arousing they had experienced each stimulus on a scale ranging from non-arousing (intensity value of 1) to arousing (intensity value of 9) on a paper-and-pencil version of the self-assessment-manikin (Bradley and Lang,  ). This session allowed us to compare skin conductance responses (SCRs) with visual emotional stimuli inside and outside the MR scanner to evaluate the effect of MRI on SCR. Moreover, it provided us with the personal ratings of emotional intensity felt by our participants for each stimulus. Verbal recordings of experienced intensity after scanning have been shown to reliably represent emotional experiences during scanning (Phan et al.,  ) and avoid biases introduced by monitoring one's own emotion during scanning (Taylor et al.,  ; Phan et al.,  ). 


### SCR acquisitions and analysis 
  
Skin conductance was recorded using an MP-150 psychophysiological monitoring system (BioPac Systems, Santa Barbara, CA). We used Ag/AgCl electrodes filled with isotonic NaCl unibase electrolytes attached to the volar surface of the second phalanx of the second and third fingers of the left hand (non-dominant hand) (Fowles et al.,  ). Amplification utilized a constant voltage technique to measure absolute conductance. Electrodermal activity (EDA) was acquired at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The skin conductance signal was recorded simultaneously with functional imaging, time-locked to visual stimuli via an analogic system between Biopac and the computer using E-prime. The acquisition of EDA during the second session 1 month later was identical. 

The MP-150 module performed analog-to-digital conversion of the amplified signals and passed data to a computer running Acknowledge 4.2 software (BioPac Systems, Santa Barbara, CA) for analysis of waveforms. 

The SCR data were processed using high-pass filter and smoothing to remove scanner-induced artifacts. The tonic component was then extracted from the phasic component, in order to suppress the effect of the precedent stimulus on the SCR of the next one (Lim et al.,  ). We defined SCR as an increase of more than 0.02 microsiemens of the skin conductance level, occurring between 1 and 6 s after presentation of the stimulus (Dawson et al.,  ). 

For each stimulus we calculated the frequency of SCRs (percentage of SCR among the 18 subjects), the magnitude (mean value computed across all stimulus presentations including those without a measurable response) and the amplitude (mean value computed across only those trials on which a measurable response occurred) of SCRs across all the subjects (Dawson et al.,  ). SCR amplitude measurements were logarithmically transformed. For the SCR magnitude measurements, a one is added to all SCR amplitudes before a logarithmic transformation in order to normalize data. 

Correlations between both sessions (inside and outside the scanner) were calculated for frequencies as well as magnitudes. 


### Imaging acquisition parameters 
  
Imaging data was collected at Besancon University Hospital using a 3-Tesla (General Electric Healthcare Signa H.D. Milwaukee, WI, USA) MR system with a standard 40 mT/m gradient using blood–oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI. Foam cushions were used to minimize head movements within the coil. Functional MRI runs were acquired parallel to the anterior-posterior commissural line, covering the entire cerebrum using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence: echo time (TE) = 35 ms, flip angle (FA) = 90°, matrix size = 128 * 128, field of view (FOV) = 256 mm, slice thickness = 4.5 mm, 30 slices and repetition time (TR) = 2500 ms. Before the first run, a high-resolution, T1-weighted, three-dimensional data set encompassing the whole brain was acquired to provide detailed anatomy (G.E. Fast Spoiled Gradient Recalled Echo sequence, matrix size = 256 * 256, FOV = 256 mm , 134 slices, slice thickness = 1 mm, no gap, total scan time = 2 min 56 s). 


### fMRI analysis 
  
Image time-series analysis was performed using BrainVoyager QX 2.4 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands) (Goebel et al.,  ). The time-series were corrected for slice acquisition time, realigned with their corresponding T1 volumes, warped into standard space (Talairach and Tournoux,  ), re-sampled into 3 mm isotropic voxels, motion-corrected using Levenberg-Marquarts's least square fit for six spatial parameters, highpass-filtered for removal of low frequency drifts, corrected voxelwise for linear drifts, and spatially smoothed using a 8-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. The general linear model (GLM) was computed from the 18 z-normalized volume time courses. For all stimuli of interest, i.e., rest and stimulation periods, box-car time courses with a value of one for the stimuli of interest and values of zero for the remaining time points were convolved with a theoretical hemodynamic response function (Boynton et al.,  ) and were entered as predictors into the design matrix of the study. Contrast analyses were based on random effects GLMs of the z-normalized volume time courses. Analyses of the stimulation periods (all groups combined) vs. rest periods as well as contrast analyses between groups were performed from the 18 subjects using a statistical threshold of q(FDR) <0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons. 


### Statistical analysis 
  
The ratings of intensity and valence were normally distributed, according to a Shapiro-Wilk test, but there was no equality of variances across the means of intensity of our three groups (Bartlett test). We performed a Kruskall-Wallis test to search for differences between our three groups using the means of intensity (subjects' ratings) and valence (norms from the IAPS) for each stimulus. When a difference was detected, we performed a Student test to search for differences between each group of stimuli. 

SCRs were not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test). We used non-parametric tests. The differences in SCRs across the three groups of stimuli were assessed using a Kruskall-Wallis test and when a difference was found, comparison between groups was made by a Welch test. The differences in SCRs across the two sessions were assessed using a Wilcoxon test. Tests were undertaken for frequency of SCRs, magnitude, and amplitude (microsiemens). 



## Results 
  
### Ratings of intensity 
  
Ratings made by our subjects were strongly correlated to IAPS norms of intensity (  r   = 0.80;   p   < 0.001) (Figure  ). The ratings made by the subjects were slightly lower than the norms of the IAPS by 0.5 points (  p   < 0.001, paired   t  -test between IAPS ratings and mean ratings from our subjects). We built three groups of 25 visual stimuli according to the mean ratings of intensity performed by subjects: Group 1 (low intensity,   m   = 2.28), Group 2 (moderate intensity,   m   = 4), and Group 3 (high intensity,   m   = 5.8). Mean ratings of intensity were statistically different between each group of stimuli (Kruskall-Wallis   p   < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the mean valence of each group (Kruskall-Wallis,   p   = 0.13) (Figure  ).

Points with a black edge represent the means of the sub-groups. Error bars are the standard error of the mean. 
  
According to these three new groups, mean luminance for the group of low intensity (respectively medium intensity, high intensity) was 87.3 (respectively 86.4, 89.9). No statistical difference was observed between groups neither for this parameter, nor for the contrast. 


### fMRI data 
  
The global fMRI analysis comparing the viewing of stimuli and rest state showed activation in the right and left anterior cingulate gyri, right, and left superior medial frontal gyri, right, and left inferior frontal gyri, right, and left posterior orbital gyri, right, and left anterior part of insula, right, and left occipital gyri, right, and left thalami (medial thalamus and pulvinar), right and left colliculi, right, and left amygdalae, right, and left parahippocampal gyri, and the vermis. These areas are known to be involved in the processing of visual emotional information (Sabatinelli et al.,  ). 

The fMRI analysis between the three groups of stimuli (according to subjects' intensity ratings) showed activations in the right and left amygdalae, the right orbital gyrus, the right pulvinar, the right, and left medial thalami, the anterior part of the insula, the right, and left colliculi, and the hypothalamus (see Tables  ,   for a full description).

Regarding the main objective of the study, we found a stronger activation of the right and left amygdalae when subjects visualized stimuli of stronger intensity (Group 3) compared to stimuli from the group of lower intensity (Group 1). The left and right amygdalae were activated by viewing emotional stimuli, as demonstrated by the analysis of the differences of cerebral activation between no stimulation (black cross) and the viewing of pictures. However, amygdala activation was stronger when subjects viewed stimuli with strong intensity compared to stimuli with low intensity, with the same valence (neutral or positive). There was no significant difference with corrected statistics in intermediary comparison (between Groups 1 and 2 and between Groups 2 and 3) for the amygdalae. These results are illustrated on Figure   after extracting beta values for each condition in four regions of interest (left and right amygdalae, right pulvinar, and the medial thalami, and hypothalamus complex) defined from the contrast Group 3 minus Group 1.

### Skin conductance responses (SCRs) 
  
#### First session, inside the scanner 
  
During the fMRI session, 16 subjects presented SCRs and 2 subjects (2 women) presented no SCRs. The magnitude and frequency of SCRs were greater for the stimuli in Group 3, rated by subjects as the most intense (  p   < 0.005) (Figure  ). There was no difference in amplitude between the three groups of stimuli (  p   = 0.09).

#### Second session, 1 month later, outside the scanner 
  
During the second phase, 17 subjects presented SCRs and 1 subject showed no SCRs (a woman who did not present any SCRs in the first phase). The frequency of SCRs for Group 3 was significantly higher than those of Groups 1 and 2 (  p   = 0.041) (Figure  ). There was no significant difference in magnitude or amplitude in SCRs in the three groups of stimuli (  p   = 0.27 and   p   = 0.5 respectively). 


#### Comparison of the session inside the scanner with the session outside the scanner 
  
Frequency, magnitude, and amplitude of the SCRs were higher during the second pass, outside the MRI scanner, compared to the first pass in the MRI scanner (respectively: frequency = 14 vs. 27%; magnitude = 0.01 vs. 0.04; amplitude = 0.08 vs. 0.12;   p   < 0.0001). 

Frequencies of electrodermal responses were significantly correlated between sessions 1 and 2 (  r   = 0.67;   p   = 0.002). Magnitudes of electrodermal responses were also significantly correlated between sessions 1 and 2 (  r   = 0.79;   p   < 0.001). 




## Discussion 
  
### Amygdala and emotional intensity 
  
We have shown that the amygdala is sensitive to the emotional intensity of positive stimuli. This result is consistent with studies in primates (Belova et al.,  ) and some studies in humans (Phan et al.,  ,  ; Sabatinelli et al.,  ; Cunningham and Kirkland,  ). However, these studies often showed a bias linked to the use of stimuli varying both in intensity and valence within the same protocol. Indeed, if we consider that the amygdala is sensitive to both the size of intensity and valence, the valence effect may mask an intensity effect if it is stronger or dependent on a higher number of amygdaloid neurons. That is why we chose to use only positive emotional stimuli in this study, to avoid the bias linked to valence. As the valences are not different between our three groups of pictures, our result is not linked to the “valence” parameter. Studies in macaques have shown that there are different groups of amygdaloid neurons that do not encode the same information. Some amygdaloid neurons were activated depending on the intensity of positive stimuli, some depending on the intensity of negative stimuli and others depending on the intensity of the two types of stimuli. These neurons are involved in mechanisms independent of valence (Belova et al.,  ). Optogenetics in mice has shown that different amygdala nuclei belong to various functional and anatomical circuits (Lalumiere,  ) involved in anxiety, fear-related behavior and regulating reinforcement and reward). Due to the limits of the resolution of functional MRI, it is not possible to accurately discriminate the different amygdaloid nuclei. To clarify the roles and networks to which they belong, further studies using other techniques, such as tractography, are needed (Solano-Castiella et al.,  ). 


### Amygdala and lateralization 
  
Our study did not reveal any specific amygdala lateralization. Various models of amygdala lateralization have been proposed, with more recent models showing that amygdala lateralization may be linked to the temporal dynamics of information processing (Wright et al.,  ). Activation of the amygdala found most frequently on the left rather than the right in some studies and meta-analyses (Murphy et al.,  ; Wager et al.,  ; Baas et al.,  ) may be related to a habituation or temporal dynamics effect. The right amygdala is involved in the initial and rapid detection of stimuli, processing data over a shorter duration of time, compared to the left amygdala that may more elaborately evaluate stimuli with a longer latency response (Gläscher and Adolphs,  ; Sergerie et al.,  ). This is consistent with the conclusion of several meta-analyses that have shown no amygdala lateralization according to stimuli valence, or sex of the subjects (Murphy et al.,  ; Wager et al.,  ; Baas et al.,  ). Interaction between amygdala laterality and task, stimulus type or novelty may not exist either (Baas et al.,  ). 


### Other activations associated with emotional intensity in this study 
  
Our study showed activation of the medial thalamus and the posterior orbital and medial prefrontal cortices, parallel to the increase in the intensity of the stimuli. Concordantly with our study, a coding of emotional intensity by the medial thalamus and the medial prefrontal cortex was demonstrated (Anders et al.,  ). The amygdala is connected to the prefrontal cortex in neocortical circuits that incorporate emotional significance of stimuli and guide complex behavior. The amygdala sends pertinent, filtered sensory information to the prefrontal cortex (directly or via the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus) and the latter returns reinforcement or inhibition information to the amygdala after more cognitive processing of information. This is likely to be due to the reciprocal connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, sources of individual emotional experience specific to humans (Purves et al.,  ; Kim et al.,  ). 

We have demonstrated that the right pulvinar and the left and right colliculi are sensitive to emotional intensity. Data for this circuit are controversial. For some, it may be responsible for the unconscious processing of visual emotional stimuli, while for others, its role, like that of the amygdala, may be to coordinate the neocortical circuits in the treatment of the relevance of visual emotional information (Buchsbaum et al.,  ; Pessoa and Adolphs,  ; Sabatinelli et al.,  ). 

Activation of the hypothalamus according to emotional intensity is consistent with amygdala activation. The latter sends projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem, allowing the expression of emotions through the modulation of autonomic and vegetative efferent motor systems. This was highlighted in this study by concomitantly monitoring the EDA, a marker of activation of the sympathetic system of the autonomic nervous system (Dawson et al.,  ). 


### Validation of stimuli intensity scoring of the IAPS 
  
Scoring the intensity of the IAPS photographs by subjects is similar to that provided by the IAPS. The average scoring of intensity by our subjects is slightly lower to that of the IAPS norms (minus 0.5 points), which is similar to scoring carried out by our neighboring countries (Switzerland, Germany; Bradley and Lang,  ). 

Thanks to the IAPS norms, we were able to build a set of stimuli sensitive to intensity, devoid of bias relating to valence, and validated in our population of subjects. 


### Electrodermal activity and emotional intensity felt 
  
In both sessions (inside and outside the MRI scanner), frequency of SCRs was greater for more intense stimuli (Group 3). Magnitude was only significantly higher for the more intense stimuli in the first session, in the MRI scanner. In contrast to data from other studies (Dawson et al.,  ) that have demonstrated an increase in the amplitude of SCRs with emotional intensity, we did not demonstrate any significant variation in the amplitude of SCRs according to intensity. Post-processing of the recording and MRI scan pass are not concerned because there is no relationship between the amplitude of SCRs and emotional intensity during the 2 phases (inside and outside the MRI scanner, not requiring post-processing). 

We obtained identical statistical results in both sessions on the relationship between stimuli intensity and amplitude of SCRs (no link during both sessions), and the relationship between stimuli intensity and frequency of SCRs (increased for Group 3 in the 2 sessions). The only difference in result between sessions is magnitude. The magnitude of SCRs is related to stimuli intensity only during the first phase, in the MRI scanner. There is a non-significant tendency during the second phase, outside the MRI scanner. One can draw several hypotheses to explain this difference. It is, first of all, a matter of calculation of magnitude, involving both the concept of response frequency and of amplitude. As amplitude was not sensitive to stimuli intensity in our study, it is likely that it is the frequency that makes variations in magnitude significant. Furthermore, it is also possible that the lack of significance of magnitude in the second session is related to a habituation effect to stimuli. Intra-subject stability of SCRs has been demonstrated 1 year later (Schell et al.,  ) but our second phase took place 1 month after the first. Finally the significance of the relationship between magnitude of SCRs and stimuli intensity in the MRI scanner might be linked to an effect specific to undergoing an MRI. The environment of the MR scanner, noise, lying down, the stress of the examination or its cramped nature could make the subject more stressed and therefore more responsive to more intense stimuli, or less responsive to less intense stimuli. This issue is important because it raises the question of comparability of emotional states inside and outside the MRI scanner. Ambient temperature, a factor known to modify SCRs (Dawson et al.,  ), is not a confounding factor because it was controlled during the two sessions. 

The values of the magnitudes, amplitudes, and frequencies of SCRs that we recorded in the MRI scanner are lower than those recorded outside the MRI scanner (Figure  ). Two factors may be responsible for this difference. First, there could have been a loss of signal due to post-processing of the EDA recording necessary when performing in the MRI. Despite MRI compatibility of the equipment used in this study, the EDA recording was artifacted by the functional MRI sequences and therefore required post-processing by selective removal of high frequencies and smoothing. However, these treatments are known to lose information, both in terms of the frequency of SCRs and in terms of their amplitude. The use of fiber optic cables (Lagopoulos et al.,  ) would avoid these artifacts and thus the loss of data linked to post-processing (Shastri et al.,  ). Undergoing an MRI scan by the subject is another factor that may explain the differences between the two sessions. The MRI might, via the stress that it can cause, block spontaneous emotional reactions. Our study cannot answer these questions. However, it can dispute the authenticity of emotional responses in the MRI scanner. 



## Conclusion 
  
These results highlight the sensitivity of the amygdala to variations in the intensity of positive emotions, and in conjunction with results in the literature on negative emotions, show the role of the amygdala in the perception of emotional intensity. 

However, the role of the amygdala has been identified in other areas, such as the behavior of consciousness, attentional mobilization (Pribram and McGuinness,  ), alertness, as well as the treatment of ambiguity of stimuli (Pessoa and Adolphs,  ). Furthermore, the anatomical location and multiple connections of the amygdala mean that it may be a center for data processing, a role more than that of a simple “danger detector” (Kim et al.,  ). The amygdala may be an early detector of the relevance of stimuli for the individual (Sander et al.,  ). Its activation in the perception of the intensity of emotional stimuli may be only a facet of its overall role in general sensory perception. 

The study of emotions in healthy subjects will eventually lead to a better understanding of dysfunctions in the pathology of emotions. The amygdala has been studied in several psychiatric pathologies involving emotional disorders such as anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. However, as its roles are multiple, underpinned by its many connections with cortical and subcortical structures, the pathophysiology of the amygdala is not limited to emotional disorders themselves but in fact extends to areas such as memory, attention, decision-making, and cognition.

# Abstract
 
The parahippocampal cortex and hippocampus are brain structures known to be involved in memory. However, the unique contribution of the parahippocampal cortex remains unclear. The current study investigates memory for object identity and memory of the configuration of objects in patients with small thermo-coagulation lesions to the hippocampus or the parahippocampal cortex. Results showed that in contrast to control participants and patients with damage to the hippocampus leaving the parahippocampal cortex intact, patients with lesions that included the right parahippocampal cortex (RPH) were severely impaired on a task that required learning the spatial configuration of objects on a computer screen; these patients, however, were not impaired at learning the identity of objects. Conversely, we found that patients with lesions to the right hippocampus (RH) or left hippocampus (LH), sparing the parahippocampal cortex, performed just as well as the control participants. Furthermore, they were not impaired on the object identity task. In the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiment, healthy young adults performed the same tasks. Consistent with the findings of the lesion study, the fMRI results showed significant activity in the RPH in the memory for the spatial configuration condition, but not memory for object identity. Furthermore, the pattern of fMRI activity measured in the baseline control conditions decreased specifically in the parahippocampal cortex as a result of the experimental task, providing evidence for task specific repetition suppression. In summary, while our previous studies demonstrated that the hippocampus is critical to the construction of a cognitive map, both the lesion and fMRI studies have shown an involvement of the RPH for learning spatial configurations of objects but not object identity, and that this takes place independent of the hippocampus.

## Introduction 
  
The hippocampal region has been implicated in memory for various kinds of information, such as memory for spatial relations (O’Keefe and Nadel,  ; Gaffan,  ), object location (Smith and Milner,  ), facts and events (Squire,  ), episodes (Vargha-Khadem et al.,  ; Tulving and Markowitsch,  ) and establishing stimulus-stimulus relationships (Petrides,  ; Eichenbaum,  ). It has also been shown that bilateral lesions to the medial temporal lobe lead to profound memory deficits (Scoville and Milner,  ; Milner,  ; Corkin,  ), while unilateral lesions lead to milder memory impairments that can be detected with cognitive assessment tools in the laboratory (Milner,  ; Petrides,  ). 

It was only later that the mnemonic role of medial temporal lobe structures adjacent to the hippocampus, such as the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortical regions, has been dissociated from that of the hippocampus in monkeys (Meunier et al.,  ; Murray and Mishkin,  ; Malkova et al.,  ; Malkova and Mishkin,  ). Studies showing that patients with lesions involving the parahippocampal cortex are impaired on a memory task do not provide information about the specific role of this structure since the hippocampus receives afferents from the parahippocampal cortex, via the entorhinal cortex (Van Hoesen,  ; Suzuki and Amaral,  ) and also directly (Rockland and Van Hoesen,  ). Thus, impairments after parahippocampal lesions can be attributed to a functional de-afferentation of the hippocampus. On the other hand, the parahippocampal cortex maintains its own strong afferent and efferent connectivity with several cortical areas, including the inferior parietal cortex (Van Hoesen,  ; Blatt et al.,  ). In order to show that the parahippocampal cortex is itself critical in certain aspects of mnemonic processing, it is necessary to show that patients with lesions to the hippocampus alone are either not impaired on particular tasks, or impaired less than patients with lesions to the parahippocampal cortex. Such a result would argue against the notion that deficits after parahippocampal damage merely reflect a functional hippocampal lesion. 

In the human brain, lesions to parahippocampal cortex and cortical regions providing input to it, such as the lingual gyrus and the inferior parietal cortex have been implicated in topographical memory loss (Landis et al.,  ; Habib and Sirigu,  ; Hublet and Demeurisse,  ; Maguire et al.,  ; Aguirre and D’Esposito,  ; Epstein et al.,  ), i.e., an impairment in the ability to find one’s way in the environment. Although studies of topographical amnesia point to damage in the parahippocampal cortex, or to regions surrounding it, they do not exclude the possibility of a functional hippocampal lesion. 

Very few case studies have effectively dissociated the mnemonic role of the parahippocampal cortex from that of the hippocampus with selective lesions (Ploner et al.,  ). In a study of spatial memory by Bohbot et al. ( ), epilepsy patients with selective thermal lesions to the right hippocampus (RH) were not impaired at finding a sensor hidden under a floor carpet, relative to patient control participants, after a 30-min delay while using novel starting positions, thereby requiring allocentric spatial memory, i.e., navigation that is independent of the position of the observer. On the other hand, patients with lesions to the parahippocampal cortex were severely impaired on this spatial task relative to the control group. Interestingly, patients and controls exhibited similar search patterns on the first trial, indicating that planning a search for the target is not dependent on medial temporal lobe areas (Bohbot et al.,  ). In monkeys, lesions to the parahippocampal cortex, but not the hippocampus, impaired performance on a delayed match-to-sample task that required memory for the locations of two objects presented over two of three foodwells (Malkova and Mishkin,  ). In this paradigm (Parkinson et al.,  ), monkeys are shown the locations of two objects in a sample phase, and in a subsequent test phase, they are shown two objects identical to one of the previously seen objects. In order to receive a reward, the monkey must select the object at the same location it occupied in the sample phase. 

Interestingly, a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study using navigation tasks that required different types of spatial representations demonstrated that, although the medial temporal lobe was activated on all tasks, the core of the activity was in the posterior parahippocampal gyrus with minimal involvement of the hippocampus itself (Rosenbaum et al.,  ). Several other fMRI studies have also demonstrated a clear dissociation between the function of the hippocampus and the parahippocampal cortex. In a virtual navigation task in which participants had to navigate in an environment devoid of landmarks during fMRI scanning and, therefore, were forced to use an egocentric navigation strategy, bilateral activity was observed in the parahippocampal cortex but not the hippocampus (Weniger et al.,  ). Morgan et al. ( ) had participants view pictures of familiar landmarks while lying in an fMRI scanner. Activity in the hippocampus was related to the distance between the landmarks, while activity in the parahippocampal cortex was related to landmark repetition. In an fMRI study by Howard et al. ( ) in which subjects were administered an incidental target detection task, the hippocampus was selectively active when the spatial relationships between the objects and the background context changed. In contrast, the parahippocampal cortex was selectively active for novel scenes. In Hartley et al. ( ), the authors distinguish between performance-independent effects and performance-related effects. They report activity in the parahippocampal cortex during the wayfinding task, unrelated to performance. In contrast, they report activity in the hippocampus during wayfinding that is associated with accurate performance. Our previous studies also demonstrated that the hippocampus is critical to learning the spatial relationships between landmarks in the environments (Bohbot et al.,  ; Konishi et al.,  ). Perhaps a critical element that distinguished studies that showed a critical involvement of the hippocampus vs. parahippocampal cortex in allocentric spatial memory, is that the hippocampus seemed to require a “construction” process, from memory, of detailed relationships between objects or landmarks in the environment, in a scene or episodes (Rosenbaum et al.,  ). Taken together, these studies and several others (Duzel et al.,  ; Goh et al.,  ; Pihlajamäki et al.,  ; Köhler et al.,  ) further support the notion that the parahippocampal cortex is functionally dissociable from the hippocampus. Still, very few studies have dissociated the role of the parahippocampal cortex from that of the hippocampus in brain damaged patients, because selective lesions to the hippocampus rarely occur as a result of vascular incidents, diseases, accidents, or surgical interventions. 

While there are many fMRI studies and many lesion studies looking at spatial memory and the medial temporal lobe, there are very few reports combining lesion and fMRI using the same paradigm. In the present article, we report a dissociation of the role of the parahippocampal cortex from that of the hippocampus in memory for the configuration of objects but not their identity. This was achieved with a special cohort of patients with small selective thermocoagulation lesions to the hippocampus and/or the parahippocampal cortex in an attempt to alleviate epilepsy. Our results from the patient study were then confirmed with a second study involving fMRI with healthy young adults. 


## Experiment 1: Cognitive Lesion Study 
  
### Materials and Methods 
  
#### Participants 
  
Two control groups and four groups of brain-operated patients were tested (see Table  ). These patients have been described elsewhere (Bohbot et al.,  ). One control group consisted of patients with back-pain problems and no epileptic problems. The second control group consisted of patients with epilepsy who had not undergone brain surgery. Of the two control groups, the patients with epilepsy control group is similar to the experimental groups with respect to the type of disorder and medication taken by patients and, therefore, serves as a better control. The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance to the guidelines of the local ethics committee.

##### Back-Pain control group 
  
Eight patients living with chronic lumbar back-pain were selected as control subjects as they suffered from a chronic medical condition that does not directly affect the central nervous system. 


##### Epilepsy control group 
  
Ten patients with epilepsy who had not undergone a neurosurgical procedure, nor thermal lesion were used as controls. These patients were on non-toxic AntiEpileptic Drug (AED) therapy at the time of the study, similar to the medication received by the brain operated patients, the difference being that the purpose was to control their epilepsy. None of the patients included presented clinical symptoms of medication toxicity. The antiepileptic drug therapy included one, two or three of the following: carbamazepine, primidone, valprolate, phenytoin, clonazepam, lamotrigine, vigabatrin, and barbiturate. The patients’ presentations were not affected by seizures on the day of testing. 


##### Brain-operated groups 
  
Fourteen patients who underwent brain surgery in an attempt to alleviate refractory epilepsy are included here. The following exclusion criteria was used: Wechsler IQs below 75, psychiatric disorders, gross brain atrophy and left-handedness. Patients were tested 4–17 years after surgery. At the time of testing, all patients were on an anticonvulsant similar to those taken by the epilepsy control group. None of the patients presented any symptoms of drug toxicity (as assessed by a neurologist) and no patient had clinical or Electroencephalogram (EEG) seizures on the day of testing. 

The anatomical landmarks used to identify patients’ lesions have been outlined elsewhere (Bohbot et al.,  ). Patients with lesions were divided into two groups according to whether or not they had damage to the parahippocampal cortex. Hippocampal lesions include damage to the hippocampus proper, as well as the dentate gyrus, and the subicular complex. Damage to the parahippocampal cortex is characterized by damage to the posterior parahippocampal gyrus, the neo-cortical region posterior to the entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex. 


##### Right hippocampus 
  
This group consisted of five patients who had damage to the RH. Patient KJ had damage to the anterior portion of the hippocampus (Figure  ) and to the amygdala, and minor damage to the perirhinal cortex. Patient BS had a lesion to the right anterior and posterior parts of hippocampus, some damage to the right amygdala, and minor damage to the anterior portion of the right perirhinal cortex and the right inferior temporal neocortex. Patient FL had bilateral damage to the amygdala and damage to the right anterior hippocampus. Patient KP had a right hippocampal lesion, specifically damage to the anterior and posterior parts of the hippocampus and additional damage to the right amygdala only. Finally, Patient MJ had a right anterior lesion to the hippocampus with additional damage to the right amygdala only. None of the patients included in this group had any damage to the parahippocampal cortex.

This section was taken 12 mm posterior to the anterior commissure (  Y   = −12) in Talairach standard stereotaxic space (Talairach and Tournoux,  ). 
  

##### Right parahippocampal cortex 
  
All five patients included in this group had damage to the right posterior parahippocampal cortex. Patient PP also had complete damage to the anterior part of the hippocampus, and partial damage to the following regions: posterior part of the hippocampus, amygdala, perirhinal and entorhinal cortices. Patient MJa had damage to both the anterior and posterior hippocampus, partial bilateral (but not symmetrical) damage to the amygdala and the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices were intact. PM had damage to the right parahippocampal cortex (RPH), anterior and posterior portions of the RH, the right amygdala, but no damage to the perirhinal cortex or entorhinal cortex. Patient PV had damage to the right anterior hippocampus and the right perirhinal cortex. Patient KrA had damage to the parahippocampal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex, but the RH was intact (Figure  ).

##### Left hippocampus 
  
Three patients, KS, SV, and VP, with lesions to the left hippocampus (LH) were included in this group, Patient KS presented with lesions in the left anterior hippocampus, left amygdala, and minor damage to the left entorhinal cortex and left perirhinal cortex. Patient SV had damage to the LH (posterior region), bilateral damage to the amygdala, and damage to the anterior portion of the left perirhinal cortex. Patient VP had a lesion to the left anterior and posterior regions of the hippocampus and the left amygdala was partially damaged. None of the patients included in this group presented with any damage to the parahippocampal cortex. 


##### Left parahippocampal cortex 
  
One patient, SI, had damage to the left parahippocampal cortex (LPH), as well as some damage to the left amygdala and left perirhinal cortex. 



#### Procedure 
  
Computerized tasks were developed to assess patients’ for two types of object information memory: changes in the spatial configuration of objects, and changes in the objects’ identity. These computerized tasks were designed according to the oddball fashion for use with evoked potentials (Allen et al.,  ). The tasks were as follows: a standard display depicting five unrelated objects appeared on 80% of the trials (standards), and this standard display was altered on 20% of the trials (Figure  ). A new object appeared in place of one of the objects on the standard display on 10% of the trials (object identity change). On another 10% of the trials, the location of two of the objects from the standard display were switched (spatial configuration change). 
  
 Stimuli  . Example of one of the two sets of stimuli used showing the standard scene, spatial configuration change and object identity change. This stimulus set was used for either the spatial or object task, and another set of stimuli was used in the other task. 
  
Participants were asked to respond to spatial configuration changes on the spatial task (targets) and ignore the object identity changes (distractors). In the object task, participants were tested with a different set of stimuli and asked to respond to a change in object identity (target), while ignoring the changes in spatial configuration (distractors). Two sets of similar stimuli were developed. Each stimulus set could be used in either task, but for any given participant each stimulus set was used for only one task. The order of task presentation was counterbalanced. 

In both the object and spatial tasks, five blocks of 50 displays of objects were presented. Each block of 50 was comprised of five sets of 10 displays, such that only one object change and one spatial configuration change occurred within each set of 10 displays. Each display was presented for a duration of 1496 ms, followed by a black screen for 2000 ms before the onset of the next display. For each trial, the participant’s reaction time was recorded up to a maximum of 1500 ms. 

##### Spatial task 
  
Participants were instructed to press the left shift key when the standard scene was presented (occurred on 80% of the trials). When two of the five objects exchanged positions (spatial configuration change; occurring on 10% of trials), participants were instructed to press the right shift key. During this task, one of the objects was replaced by a novel object on another 10% of the trials (object identity change). Participants were instructed to ignore this object change and to press the left key. The keyboard was marked with the word “space” on the right, and the word “object” on the left in order to cue the participants. 


##### Object task 
  
Participants were instructed to press the left shift key when the standard scene was presented (80% of the trials). When one of the five objects was replaced by a novel object (object identity change), which happened 10% of the time, participants were instructed to press the right key. During this task, an exchange of the position of two of the objects (spatial configuration change) occurred on another 10% of the trials. The participants were instructed to ignore this spatial configuration change and to press the left key. The keyboard was marked with the word “object” on the right, and the word “space” on the left in order to cue the participants. 

In summary, during either task, participants indicated their response by either pressing the left key for standards and distractors (“NO” response), or a right key for the targets (“YES” response). The participant’s target detection was “correct” if the right key was pressed for the change in object identity during the object task, or if the right key was pressed for the change in configuration of objects in the spatial task. A response was incorrect if the right key was pressed for either the standards or irrelevant changes. 



#### Analysis 
  
A non-parametric analysis of variance, the Kruskal-Wallis H test, was used to analyze the data as the assumption of a normal distribution cannot be made with small groups. The single patient with a left parahippocampal lesion was not included in any of the statistical analyses. One participant from the Epilepsy patient control (EPC) and one participant from the RH group (patient BS) were outside the distribution of the number of non-responses to standards, and over two standard deviations from the mean. The high number of non-responses to the standard situation was an indication that they were not participating in the task; they were therefore excluded from the analysis. Responses to the standard displays that followed the identity or spatial switch events were never included in the analyses, as these represented a change back to the standard condition. The five groups included in the analyses were: the back-pain control participants (BPC), the EPC participants, the RH, RPH, and LH groups. For both the object and spatial detection task, the Kruskal-Wallis test was performed on the correct “YES” responses divided by the total number of responses made (either to spatial or object changes). Statistical analyses were also performed on non-responses, “NO” responses to standard scenes, and slowing latencies to irrelevant changes. Further analysis was done with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test for comparing two independent samples (two-tailed test). First, we compared the Back-Pain Control group to the Epilepsy Patient Control group. The Back-Pain Control group and the Epilepsy Patient Control group were then compared with each surgical patient group, and the group with lesions to the RH was compared to the group with lesions to the RPH. 



### Results 
  
On average, participants responded to 97.5% of the stimuli within the allotted time, and this rate of response did not differ by group for either the spatial task (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 8.24, df = 4, n.s.) or the object task (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 1.41, df = 4, n.s.). During both the object and spatial tasks, only the trials during which participants made a response were analyzed. Consequently, all the “YES” and “NO” responses added to 100% of the analyzed trials. A comparison of the five groups showed that participants’ correct (“NO”) responses did not differ on standard scenes of the spatial task (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 2.63, df = 4, n.s.) or the object task (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 4.33, df = 4, n.s.), and since these are not of primary interest, they will not be discussed further. There were no group differences for the reaction times to object identity changes during the spatial task (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 0.50, df = 4, n.s.) or to spatial configuration changes during the object task (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 5.67, df = 4, n.s.). 

#### Spatial Task 
  
The right parahippocampal patients, and to some extent the right and LH patients showed poor discrimination of the spatial configuration from the object identity changes in the spatial task (Figure  ). In other words, patients with damage to the parahippocampal cortex answered “YES” to any change, whether spatial or object changes, showing no discrimination between the two. On the other hand, patients with damage to the RH and LH correctly responded “YES” more often to the spatial change, than to the object change. The detection of spatial configuration change (i.e., the “YES” response) was different across groups (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 17.71, df = 4,   p   < 0.001). The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test for two independent samples showed that performance of the two control groups did not differ significantly. The right parahippocampal participants were impaired relative to the control participants with epilepsy (  z   = 2.93,   p   < 0.005), and relative control participants with back-pain (  z   = 2.89,   p   < 0.005). The left and right hippocampal patients were impaired relative to the BPC (left:   z   = 1.98,   p   < 0.05; right:   z   = 2.33,   p   < 0.05); however, they were not impaired relative to the epileptic patient control participants (left:   z   = 1.48, n.s.; right:   z   = 0.85, n.s.). This implies that the left or right hippocampal lesion itself did not significantly increase the impairment resulting from the change in performance observed in participants with epilepsy. The lesion that included the RPH, however, did impair performance on this task. In addition, the group with lesions to the RPH was significantly impaired relative to the RH lesion group (  z   = 2.33,   p   < 0.05), thus showing that the impairment resulting from the RPH was dissociated from that of the RH. These results were previously reported elsewhere (Bohbot et al.,  ).

While participants were engaged in the spatial task, there were significant differences (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 9.76, df = 4,   p   < 0.05) in the number of incorrect “YES” responses to the object identity change (distractors; Figure  ). The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test showed that only patients with damage to the RPH were impaired relative to the patient control group with epilepsy (  z   = 2.15,   p   < 0.05) and relative to the control group with back-pain (  z   = 2.59,   p   < 0.01). None of the other tested comparisons were significant. These results show that only the patients with lesions to the RPH were affected by the presence of distractors in the spatial task. 


#### Object Task 
  
There were significant differences in correct detection of the object identity change (“YES” responses) during the object task (Figure  ) across all groups (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 11.91, df = 4,   p   < 0.01). The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test showed that the two control groups were not different from each other and the right parahippocampal group was impaired relative to the back-pain control group (  z   = 3.01,   p   < 0.01) but not compared to the control participants with epilepsy (  z   = 1.91, n.s.). Patients with lesions to the RH or LH were not impaired on this task, either relative to the BPC or relative to the control participants with epilepsy. However, patients with lesions to the RPH were impaired relative to patients with right sided lesions to the hippocampus (  z   = 2.38,   p   < 0.05) suggesting that the right parahippocampal lesion itself was responsible for the impairment. It should be noted, however, that the performance of all but one participant in the right parahippocampal group ranged between 84% and 96% correct (see Figure  ) on the object identity task, which is in striking contrast to performance on the spatial configural task where the same patients scored an average of 35% correct, and thus the noted impairment has a small impact on the actual performance.

See legend of Figure   for the description of labels. *Significantly different from the BPC (  p   < 0.01) and the RH (  p   < 0.05) groups in responses to object changes. 
  
There were no differences (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 3.03, df = 4, n.s.) in incorrect “YES” responses to the irrelevant spatial configuration change (distractors; see Figure  ). It should be noted that patients with lesions to the RPH were not affected by the distractors during the object task, which contrasts with the fact that they were severely affected by the distractors while performing the spatial task. These results show that the patients with lesions to the RPH were selectively impaired at the spatial task, with preserved performance in the object task. 



### Discussion 
  
The present experiment measured memory for object identity (learning which objects were part of a standard scene) and memory for the configuration of objects (learning the spatial arrangement of objects on the screen). Both of these tasks required participants to react to one kind of change and ignore the other, in order to avoid responses due solely to novelty. 

Patients with lesions to the RPH were impaired on the spatial task even when compared with epilepsy control participants and participants with lesions to the RH. They were largely unable to detect the spatial configuration changes, and responded equally to both the spatial configuration and object identity changes (Figure  ). The fact that patients with lesions to the RPH were impaired relative to patients with lesions to the RH indicates that the deficit resulting from the lesion in the parahippocampal cortex is unlikely simply to reflect a functional lesion in hippocampus. Thus, it suggests that the parahippocampal cortex plays a role in this spatial memory function above and beyond transmitting information to the hippocampus. 

Patients with lesions to the RH or LH were impaired relative to the back-pain control group, but not relative to the epilepsy control group on the spatial task. Despite their impairment, the patients with lesions to the hippocampus performed well (average 77% correct for the right and 60% correct for the left) compared to with patients in the right parahippocampal group (average 35% correct). A table-top task that assesses similar functions as our spatial task, was administered by Watson et al. ( ) to patients with lesions to the hippocampus. In this study, object was placed on a table-top and participants were asked to remember where the objects are located. After a 4 s blind delay, participants were asked to replace the objects in the correct relative positions. Patients with lesions to the hippocampus made significantly more “swap” errors, in which they often swapped the relative position of objects. At first, these findings appear inconsistent with the current study, in which patients with lesions to the hippocampus were not impaired at indicating when the spatial location of two objects was swapped. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. The first is that in Watson et al. ( ), the lesions were not specific to the hippocampus and the authors report that all three patients had varying degrees of damage to the temporal lobes. Although it is not specified in the study, it is highly likely that this also includes damage to the parahippocampal cortex. Therefore, the “swap” errors observed in Watson et al. ( ) may in part be related to damage to the parahippocampal cortex. The second reason for the discrepancy may be that in Watson et al. ( ), the comparison group was healthy controls, while in the current study, the comparison groups were other patients. If Watson et al. ( ) compared their sample to other patient groups, then their impairments may be less pronounced. The third is that, in Watson et al. ( ) the location of objects has to be reconstructed from memory, whereas in the current study, there is no “reconstruction” required by the patients. Instead, patients are presented with images of objects, and they need to recognize when a swap has taken place. This interpretation is consistent with a paper by Stepankova et al. ( ) where patients with selective lesions to the hippocampus were impaired at reconstructing from memory the location of objects. In that 2004 study, patients were impaired despite the fact that swaps were taken into account, providing evidence for the role of the hippocampus in the construction of a cognitive map, of object locations in this case. In the current study, the significance in the comparison of the hippocampal groups in relation to the control group with back-pain indicates that the impairment is the result of factors related to both having epilepsy (i.e., medication, disorder, dysfunction of the medial temporal lobe etc.) and the thermal lesion. However, since there were no differences between the two groups with hippocampal lesions and the epilepsy control group, ascribing a possible deficit to the specific thermal lesion within the medial temporal region is not possible. We can therefore conclude that medial temporal areas, including the LH and RH are involved in this task, and that the remaining ability of the hippocampal groups, in the performance of the spatial task, can be accounted for by their intact parahippocampal cortex. 

All of the patients (with RH or LH or parahippocampal cortex lesions) had comparable scores on the object task (Figure  ). If participants with thermal lesions to the RPH were poor at learning the spatial configuration of the objects, it is understandable that they successfully ignored these changes while performing the object task. The fact that they performed well on the object task (average 82% correct) compared with the spatial task (average 35% correct) indicates that they encoded the identity of objects during the task. Our data show that the deficits in patients with lesions to the RPH were severe for the spatial configuration but not for object identity. 



## Experiment 2: fMRI with Healthy Young Adults 
  
### Materials and Methods 
  
#### Participants 
  
Eight healthy young adults (mean age = 31.75 ± 5.00; four women and four men) participated in the fMRI experiment. All participants were right handed and had normal vision. None of the participants had any history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses. Recruitment was done by word of mouth. The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance to the guidelines of the local ethics committee. 


#### Procedure 
  
##### Cognitive task 
  
Participants were presented with five objects on a projection screen; a new set of similar objects was used, relative to those presented in the patient study. On 10% of the trials, participants viewed a change in spatial locations of two of the objects (spatial configural change) and on another 10% of the trials one object were replaced by a new one (object identity change). For each set of five objects, the new object always remained the same (a sixth object). In the spatial task, participants were instructed to respond to spatial configuration changes (targets) and ignore the object identity changes (distractors). In the object task, participants were tested with a different set of stimuli and were asked to respond to a change in object identity (target), while ignoring the changes in spatial configuration (distractor). Consequently, participants view the same types of changes in both tasks, but they have to discriminate which changes they must respond to depending on whether they are engaged in the spatial configuration task or the object identity task. 


##### Control task 
  
In the control tasks, participants viewed the same objects as in the experimental tasks, but they were instructed to always press the same key so that no change needed to be detected. 


##### Neuroimaging 
  
Participants were scanned in a Siemens 1.5 T Scanner at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Participants were comfortably placed in the scanner with their heads immobilized with an air cushion. Prior to the functional scans, T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired to allow coregistration of functional and anatomical data. A three-dimensional gradient echo acquisition was used to collect 80 contiguous 2 mm T1-weighted images in the sagittal plane. Seven whole brain fMRI scans per participant were collected. Each functional scan consisted of 120 T2*-weighted image volumes acquired at 4 s intervals, giving a total duration of 8 min per scan. Each functional scan was acquired using 26 contiguous 5 mm axial slices positioned parallel to the hippocampus and covering the entire brain (TR = 4000 ms; echo   time   = 50 ms; field of view = 320 mm ; matrix size = 64 × 64; 120 whole brain acquisitions/run). Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal images were spatially smoothed (6 mm Gaussian kernel), corrected for motion, and linearly transformed into standard stereotaxic space (Talairach and Tournoux,  ) using in-house software (Collins et al.,  ). Each scan consisted of four blocs, each having (a) baseline control; (b) object or spatial task; and (c) baseline control, with different sets of stimuli for each of the blocs (see Figures  – ). During each bloc (the two baseline conditions and the experimental condition) 60 stimuli were presented with 1 s “on” and 1 s “off”, thus a bloc had a duration of 2 min. Twenty-eight sets of stimuli were used, each following the same format so that one set of stimuli was used during only one bloc per subject. Each stimulus set could be used in either task, but for any given participant a stimulus set was used for only one task. The order of task presentation was counterbalanced and the order of bloc segments was randomized. The objects appearing in each of the 28 sets were randomized between participants. The data were analyzed by correlating a predicted hemodynamic response curve with the fMRI time-courses, using FMRISTAT (Worsley et al.,  ). This paradigm allowed us to contrast neuronal activity between the baseline scan and the spatial task or object task, and the two baseline scans before and after the experimental condition. Since the oddball appeared at random intervals within each 20 s period, an event-related fMRI analysis was done by comparing the hemodynamic responses to the object or spatial oddballs when presented as a targets or distractors.

Each block involved visual presentation of a given display of five objects in 80% of the occurrences (standards; see Figure  ). Spatial configural changes from the standard display occurred in 10% of the presentations (i.e., two objects exchanged positions see Figure   and object identity changes occurred in 10% of the presentations (a 6th object replaced any one of the five in the display; see Figure  ). During the scans, participants responded to each visual display by 1-always clicking the left mouse button (baseline see Figure  ), 2-detecting the spatial changes with the right mouse button, or 3-detecting the object changes with the right mouse button, clicking on the left for all other non-target stimuli (see Figure  ). Stimuli were viewed for 1 s with 1 s inter-stimulus interval. There were four repetitions of Baseline-Task-Baseline per scan and seven scans per participant (totaling 28 repetitions; Figures  – ). Each repetition involved a unique set of objects (28 sets of objects). The order of conditions was presented in a semi-random fashion. Participants practiced before entering the scanner. Based on our   a priori   hypothesis, an uncorrected   p  -value of 0.001 was used for voxels in the predicted regions of interest (  N   = 8,   t   = 4.785), namely the parahippocampal cortex which we hypothesized to be involved in the spatial task based on the current experiment with brain lesioned patients, and the temporal and parietal cortices because of their well-known roles in processing information about object identity for the temporal cortex and visuo-spatial perception for the parietal cortex. A statistical   t  -threshold of 4.785 at   p   < 0.001 is similar to other studies that report parahippocampal activity (Goh et al.,  ; Köhler et al.,  ; Weniger et al.,  ; Howard et al.,  ; Morgan et al.,  ). For the whole brain, a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to calculate the   t  -statistical threshold at   p   < 0.05 (  N   = 8,   t   = 22.04). All peaks above 4.785 outside our regions of interest are reported, but they are not discussed since they do not cross the threshold for whole brain Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Regions close to the significant threshold for our regions of interest are also identified. 




### Results 
  
#### Spatial Task 
  
During the spatial memory configural task, there was an increase in activity in the RPH (  x   = 24,   y   = −38,   z   = −16;   t   = 3.79,   p   < 0.005) when this active condition (detection of spatial configural change) was contrasted to the active memory for object identity task (detection of the object identity change) (Figure  ). This finding is consistent with our original premise as well as the results from the experiment with the brain lesioned patients. There was also bilateral activation in the parietal cortex (left:   x   = −26,   y   = −56,   z   = 42;   t   = 8.32,   p   < 0.00005; right:   x   = 26,   y   = −60,   z   = 36;   t   = 8.64,   p   < 0.00005; Figure  ) and the right frontal cortex (Table  ). There was no significant difference in fMRI activity in the hippocampus between the spatial memory configural task and the object identity task.

The negative values in the object identity task represent greater activity during that task when it was contrasted to the spatial task.

When contrasting the two baseline conditions, before and after the spatial task for that specific set of stimuli, there were decreases in activity in the RPH (Figure  ; Table  ) (i.e., for the contrast of baseline after the spatial task minus baseline before the spatial task, for a given set of stimuli). This is interesting in the light of the fact that participants did not engage in any task during these baseline conditions and that the pattern of change that occurred in the contrast between these baseline conditions was different for the baseline conditions around the spatial task vs. those around the object task.

This is interesting in the light of the fact that participants did not engage in any task during these baseline conditions and that the pattern of change that occurred in the contrast between these baseline conditions was different for the baseline conditions around the spatial task vs. those around the object task. Note that the spatial configuration task and the object identity task were not included in these analyses.

#### Object Task 
  
During the object task, there was activity in the anterior temporal lobes bilaterally (left:   x   = −46,   y   = 8,   z   = −34;   t   = −4.15,   p   < 0.005; right:   x   = 34,   y   = 0,   z   = −28;   t   = −3.99,   p   < 0.005; Figure  , Table  ). 

When contrasting the two baseline conditions, before and after the object task for that specific set of stimuli, there were decreases in activity in the left fusiform and RPH (Figure  ; Table  ). Interestingly, however, the decrease in left fusiform cortex activity was specific to the object identity condition. This is interesting in the light of the fact that participants did not engage in any task during these baseline conditions and that the pattern of change that occurred in the contrast between these baseline conditions was different for the baseline conditions around the spatial task vs. those around the object task.

### Discussion 
  
An increase in activity in the parahippocampal cortex was measured during the spatial task compared to the object task, thus supporting results obtained in the cognitive experiment discussed previously, showing that the parahippocampal cortex was critical for the spatial task in patients with specific lesions to the parahippocampal cortex. The behavioral response, task and visual presentation of the two baseline subtraction conditions were identical; yet, the spatial and object tasks administered between the two conditions modulated the activity of the parahippocampal cortex. In addition, the object task modulated the activity of the left fusiform gyrus more than the spatial task. Since patients with lesions to the RPH performed well on the object task, the left fusiform gyrus may have represented the information critical for the object identity task. These results provide further confirmation that the parahippocampal cortex is involved in acquisition and long-term changes related to the spatial configural task tested in the Oddball fashion. 

The inferior parietal cortex was activated in healthy participants when they performed the spatial task in the fMRI scanner. Structurally and functionally, there are extensive connections between the parietal cortices and the parahippocampal cortex (Van Hoesen,  ; Blatt et al.,  ). Increased connectivity between the parahippocampal cortex and parietal cortices (specifically, the angular gyrus) has been found during tasks that require the identification of novel objects (Howard et al.,  ). It is possible that the inferior parietal cortex plays a role in recognizing changes in the spatial layout of the scenes presented. Ciaramelli et al. ( ) showed that the parietal cortex was specifically involved in egocentric navigation by showing that patients with damage to the posterior parietal cortex were specifically impaired in an egocentric route learning task, while allocentric navigation was spared. In addition, the inferior parietal cortex may play a role in bringing attention to details of the environment (Cabeza et al.,  ). Berryhill et al. ( ) showed that patients with bilateral damage to the inferior parietal cortex exhibited a deficit in autobiographical memory. Specifically, there was a deficit in richness of details when the patients freely recalled autobiographical memories. In the present study, there was activity in the inferior parietal cortex when participants were presented with a new spatial configuration. The activity in the inferior parietal cortex may be due to the attentional demands required when there is a specific change in spatial configuration. 

It is interesting to note that, since our object task and spatial task were similar in perceptual stimulation (perception of five objects on a screen), the significant fMRI activity observed in the parahippocampal cortex (during the spatial task minus object task, or the contrast between the two baseline conditions) was a reflection of top down processing (not perceptually driven by the five objects). In other words, the differential activity measured between the two identical baseline tasks or the two active experimental tasks are likely to have represented the information processing relative to the instructions and not relative to the perceptual representation of the stimuli, since these were similar across all conditions. The fact that in one case there was an increase in fMRI activity in the parahippocampal cortex (in the contrast between the two active conditions) and that in the other case there was a decrease in fMRI activity in the parahippocampal cortex (in the contrast between the two baseline conditions) suggest that the changes in fMRI activity to identical perceptual features do not reflect any kind of habituation to the stimuli. As such, we conclude that activity measured in the parahippocampal cortex reflected top down processing. 

Furthermore, repetition suppression was previously reported in the literature when stimuli were repeatedly presented (Brozinsky et al.,  ; Epstein et al.,  ,  ). While repetition suppression typically refers to very rapidly presented stimuli, and is thought to reflect specific neuronal effects (reduced firing on the second of two rapid stimuli; Epstein et al.,  ) our data show different patterns of repetition suppression for the different tasks. This provides strong evidence that repetition suppression can come as a result of learning. In the literature, repetition suppression was observed in the parahippocampal cortex (Epstein et al.,  ,  ,  ). In Epstein et al. ( ), it was found that good navigators showed larger repetition effects than bad navigators suggesting that better learning had an impact on suppression of fMRI activity. These data suggest that repetition suppression can implicate a reduction of activity that occurs with learning. 



## General Discussion 
  
The combined results from these two studies highlight the importance of the parahippocampal cortex in spatial configural learning, independently from the hippocampus. Functional brain imaging experiments have implicated the parahippocampal cortex in different tasks requiring spatial processing. For example spatial navigation in a virtual, visual maze produced extensive activations of the parahippocampal cortex, bilaterally, in both fMRI (Brewer et al.,  ) and PET (Maguire et al.,  ) studies. Viewing scenes has also activated the parahippocampal cortex in fMRI experiments (Stern et al.,  ; Brewer et al.,  ; Epstein and Kanwisher,  ). Further, participants viewing a videotaped tour of houses displayed increased activation in the right parahippocampal gyrus when asked to recall spatial location or temporal order, but not object identity (Hayes et al.,  ). Interestingly though, it has been shown through a novel paradigm that the parahippocampal cortex is involved in the formation of contextual associations regardless of spatial information content (Aminoff et al.,  ). 

A systematic study of the components of a scene that elicit activity in the parahippocampal cortex revealed that the walls forming an indoor room, without objects, were sufficient to produce high activity in the parahippocampal cortex (Epstein and Kanwisher,  ) but that the spatial arrangement of objects or single objects was not sufficient for activation of the parahippocampal cortex. Interestingly, familiar landmarks, represented by buildings cut out from their background produced a signal in the parahippocampal cortex significantly higher than the response to household objects. This study strongly suggested that the parahippocampal cortex processes information related to places (Epstein and Kanwisher,  ). In support of this, on an fMRI task, Howard et al. ( ) found that activity in the parahippocampal cortex was related to the presentation of novel scenes. This function was separate from the hippocampus, which showed more selective activity to changes in the spatial relationship between objects and their background context. However, there are also alternate findings in the literature supporting a theory that the parahippocampal cortex also mediates contextual associations (Bar et al.,  ). In Janzen and van Turennout ( ), participants navigated through an environment in which objects were places at navigationally relevant (serving as landmarks) and non-relevant locations. Later on, when the objects were presented on their own, outside of the environment, the parahippocampal cortex was active only for objects that were navigationally relevant, even when the participant did not consciously recollect seeing the object. Our study showed that the parahippocampal cortex was critical for memory for the configuration of objects even without a background. Perhaps the memory component for the spatial arrangement of objects in our task involved the parahippocampal cortex in a way not needed during passive viewing of objects. The findings suggesting that the parahippocampal cortex responds to a landmark (e.g., building) and not an object (e.g., blender) support the idea that the spatial attribute of the stimuli tapped into the function of the parahippocampal cortex. 

In another study, the magnitude of the parahippocampal activation was correlated with subsequent recollection of single scenes in a single event fMRI study, thus implicating the parahippocampal cortex in memory for scenes (Brewer et al.,  ). Imaging studies implicating the parahippocampal cortex in memory for scenes and lesion studies that show a dissociation between the parahippocampal cortex and the hippocampus support the hypothesis that the parahippocampal cortex itself can sustain memory. 

Several studies have noted the role of the retrosplenial cortex in spatial learning (Epstein and Higgins,  ; Epstein et al.,  ; Auger et al.,  ; Auger and Maguire,  ; Epstein and Vass,  ). However, in the current paradigm, we did not observe activity in the retrosplenial cortex. There are several reasons that may explain this discrepancy, one of which may be the low sample size. However, findings from the current fMRI study are consistent with behavioral findings from patients with lesions tested on the same paradigm, thus providing validity to our results despite the low sample size. An alternate explanation may be related to the function of the retrosplenial cortex. Although the exact role of the retrosplenial cortex is unclear, in Epstein and Vass ( ), the restrosplenial cortex is described as playing a role in localization and orientation in an environment. It is also described as playing a role in coding stable landmarks in an environment and storing spatial knowledge between well-traveled locations. The current paradigm does not require localization, orientation, or coding of permanent landmarks in an environment. Therefore, for this reason, we may not have observed activity in the retrosplenial cortex. 

The studies of patients with thermal lesions have shown that both the RH and the RPH are important in spatial memory (Bohbot et al.,  ). The RPH seems to be involved in memory for spatial configuration of objects as well as memory for a location in an environment found during real space navigation. The hippocampus, on the other hand, seems to be involved in forming spatial relationships between environmental objects or landmarks in order to construct cognitive maps used in navigation (Iaria et al.,  ; Konishi et al.,  ). For example, the object location task that was sensitive to selective lesions to the hippocampus, sparing the parahippocampal cortex, required patients to construct a top-down view of the environment from their first person view experience; hence they had to generate a cognitive map (Bohbot et al.,  ). When the first person view is sufficient for navigation (i.e., they do not need to construct a top-down view in order to navigate), the parahippocampal cortex seems to be sufficient (Bohbot et al.,  ). While the current task required building spatial relationships, it did not necessarily require the construction of a cognitive map because one could learn the spatial configuration of stimuli by memorizing the spatial relations in a single scene (Bohbot et al.,  ; Brewer et al.,  ; Epstein and Kanwisher,  ). Furthermore, when tested in a dual solution task previously shown to be dependent on either the hippocampus or the caudate nucleus with fMRI (Iaria et al.,  ), patients with brain damage to the hippocampus are severely impaired at constructing cognitive maps (i.e., remembering the locations of target objects in relation to environmental landmarks; Bohbot et al.,  ). Interestingly, the parahippcampal cortex sends massive projections to both the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. Therefore, the parahippocampal cortex may provide the spatial information necessary for building stimulus-response relationships at the level of the caudate nucleus used for navigation (i.e., navigating by learning a sequence of specific motor behaviors such as a right or left turn, when reaching landmarks that act as stimuli; Packard et al.,  ; White and McDonald,  ), and in parallel, spatial information from the parahippocampal cortex may be processed by the hippocampus to form cognitive maps. Further research targeting such dissociations is necessary to delineate the specific spatial roles played by the parahippocampal cortex and the hippocampus. It is interesting to note that, in rats, larger hippocampal lesions are required to cause object recognition deficits than spatial memory deficits (Broadbent et al.,  ), suggesting in a different way, that the hippocampus is more critical for spatial memory than object recognition. The present results show that the parahippocampal cortex itself plays a critical role in spatial memory that can be dissociated from that of the hippocampus. The present experiment is also the first to reveal task specific repetition suppression associated with repetition of the baseline control condition in the very same region proven to be critical for learning the task in a brain-lesion study. The latter findings suggest a top-down, task specific modulation of repetition suppression in the parahippocampal cortex.

# Abstract
 
 Background:   Whether individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) are able to accurately perceive emotions from faces of others is unclear. Furthermore, whether individuals with AN process images of their own face differently to healthy individuals has thus far not been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate facial affect processing and the processing of one’s own face through measures of emotion identification, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eyetracking. 

 Methods:   Twenty-four females with AN and 25 matched healthy control participants were presented with an implicit emotion processing task during fMRI and eyetracking, followed by an explicit emotion identification task. 

 Results:   The AN group were found to ‘hyperscan’ stimuli and avoided visually attending to salient features of their own face images. Results of the fMRI revealed increased activity to own face stimuli in AN in the right inferior and middle temporal gyri, and right lingual gyrus. AN participants were not found to display emotion identification deficits to the standard emotional face stimuli. 

 Discussion:   The findings are discussed in terms of increased anxiety to disorder-relevant stimuli in AN. Potential clinical implications are discussed in relation to the use of eyetracking techniques to improve the perception of self in AN. 
 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric condition characterized by a significantly low body weight, a fear of weight gain and a disturbance in the experience of one’s own body weight or shape ( ). A common pathognomonic psychological factor in AN is the disturbance of body image ( ). AN also significantly overlaps with anxiety disorders in terms of symptoms and phenomenology, particularly obsessive compulsive disorder ( ;  ). Additionally, AN has long been associated with deficits in the perception of emotion; in her pioneering work,   observed a marked deficiency in the description of feelings and emotional responses in patients with AN. Later research has linked these deficiencies to the construct of alexithymia, which is defined as a difficulty in identifying and describing subjective feelings, a difficulty in distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal, an externally oriented cognitive style, and a lack of imaginal capacity and fantasy ( ). Increased rates of alexithymia have been consistently reported in AN ( ;  ;  ), though whether individuals with AN have difficulty in the processing of other people’s emotions has not been significantly elucidated. 

A number of studies have reported that AN patients perform poorly on tasks probing human face emotion identification (also referred to as ‘facial affect processing’). Some authors have reported that this deficit was not specific to any particular emotion ( ), while others have found deficits that are specific to the identification of surprise ( ;  ), sadness ( ;  ), disgust ( ), and fear ( ). In only one study of which we are aware, the authors did not find any emotion identification deficit in AN ( ). The consistency of these findings has prompted researchers to explore the neurobiological basis of this impairment in AN using neuroimaging techniques. 

To date, only two published functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have investigated facial affect processing in AN.   found that AN patients exhibited increased blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation in the right fusiform gyrus in response to mildly happy, prototypically happy, and neutral human face expressions compared to controls. In contrast,   did not find any group differences with their paradigm that used fearful and happy human face expressions. However, the findings of these studies have limited utility as neither contrasted the affect images with neutral affect images to control for differential between group face processing   per se  ;   contrasted the emotions to a baseline (fixation cross) and   contrasted fearful and happy conditions with one another. 

Another related set of studies have analyzed visual scanpaths and have revealed critical information for understanding face emotion processing in a range of psychiatric conditions. During face stimulus processing, healthy individuals focus on salient features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth ( ), whereas patients with psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, show reduced visual attention to these features ( ;  ). Furthermore, although poorer attention to salient features has been found in psychiatric populations such as schizophrenia during implicit emotion processing tasks, typical attention to salient features has been found when explicit task instructions are given ( ). Individuals with psychiatric conditions also show different scanpath strategies: those with anxiety disorders such as social anxiety disorder ‘hyperscan’ (increased scanpath lengths with fixations of shorter duration) face stimuli ( ), whereas those with schizophrenia show a restricted scanpath of fewer fixations of longer duration, and reduced scanpath lengths ( ). Whether individuals with AN also exhibit discrepant visual scanpath behavior when viewing face stimuli relative to healthy individuals, has thus far not been thoroughly investigated. During a free-viewing task where participants were presented with whole body stimuli and face stimuli,   reported reduced attention to the eye region of face stimuli, and less time visually attending face regions when whole bodies were presented in AN. However, the findings of that study are limited as no attempt was made to standardize the stimuli acquired from a dating website.  , on the other hand, presented participants images of their own bodies photographed in a black leotard and reported that while healthy controls spent relatively the same amount of time focusing on four interest areas (face, chest, abdomen, and legs), individuals with AN spent more time looking at the their legs and abdomen and less time looking at the face, suggesting an avoidance of fixating one’s own face in AN. 

The aim of the current study was to investigate the processing of emotional faces of others, and faces of self, in AN. Participants performed an implicit emotion processing task that involved gender identification of stimuli while undergoing fMRI and eyetracking, and an explicit emotion identification task outside the scanner during eyetracking. Functional imaging studies of emotional face perception are typically performed as implicit tasks, such as gender decision tasks, rather than explicit tasks as they are less cognitively demanding and do not interfere with emotional processing. As explicit tasks have a higher cognitive demand, more frontal areas are involved and it is more difficult to observe the areas involved in emotion processing ( ;  ). Performing the task both implicitly and explicitly also allowed for the investigation of emotion perception and scanpaths under different conditions. As scanning behaviors have not previously been specifically investigated in AN, individuals with AN were expected to exhibit similar scanning behaviors to related conditions such as anxiety disorders, namely, hyperscanning of face stimuli during both tasks (i.e., increased fixations of shorter duration). Similarly to other psychiatric conditions, we further hypothesized that AN participants would show an avoidance of salient features of the emotional face stimuli during the implicit task. As typical attention to salient features has been found when explicit task instructions are given in populations that demonstrate poor attention to salient features during implicit tasks ( ), groups were not expected to differ in areas of attentional focus during the explicit task. In relation to participants’ own face stimuli and given the avoidance of looking at one’s own face as reported by  , the AN group were hypothesized to show less attention to salient features during both tasks. Individuals with AN were also expected to show emotion identification deficits to face stimuli displaying negative emotion, but were not expected to show emotion recognition difficulties to their own face when they were asked to display a neutral expression. Related to this hypothesis, the AN group were expected to manifest reduced activity in limbic areas of the brain to negative affect stimuli, relative to neutral control faces; and to show reduced activity to stimuli of their own face in frontoparietal brain areas which are involved in the processing of ones’ own face ( ). 


## Materials and Methods 
  
This study was approved by the human research ethics departments at The University of Melbourne, Swinburne University of Technology, The Melbourne Clinic, The Austin Hospital, and St Vincent’s Hospital; all in Melbourne, VIC, Australia. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants. All procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. 

### Participants 
  
Twenty-four right-handed individuals with AN and 25 healthy control (HC) individuals were recruited for the study. One participant in the AN group declined to have her own face included among the stimuli and her data were not included in the analysis. A programming error resulted in one HC participant being presented with too few own face stimuli and her data were excluded. Technical difficulties encountered with use of the eyetracking equipment in the MRI resulted in the data of three AN participants and three HC participants being excluded, allowing eyetracking analyses to be conducted on 20 AN and 21 HC participants. All 23 AN and 24 HC participants’ data were included in the fMRI and emotion identification analyses. 

HCs were recruited through public advertisements, whereas AN participants were recruited through public advertisements, the Body Image and Eating Disorders Treatment and Recovery Service at the Austin and St Vincent’s Hospitals, and The Melbourne Clinic (all located in Melbourne, VIC, Australia). All participants were English speaking, had no history of significant brain injury or neurological condition, no significant ocular pathology and normal (or corrected to normal) visual acuity. Controls were required to have no history of an eating disorder or other mental illness; they were also required to not be taking any medications apart from hormonal contraceptives (11 HC participants were taking this medication). AN participants were instructed to continue with their normal medications, which were: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (10), atypical antipsychotics (10), benzodiazepines (5), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (3), hormonal contraceptives (3), melatonergic antidepressants (2), noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) (1), and cyclopyrrolones (1). Medications that patients were taking, such as benzodiazepines and atypical antipsychotics have been found to moderately reduce saccadic peak velocity ( ), but do not affect scanpaths to the best of our knowledge. 

The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, 5.0.0 (MINI;  ) was used to screen participants for major Axis I psychiatric disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). It was also used to confirm diagnoses of AN, with the exception of the amenorrhea criterion which is not included in DSM-5 criteria. AN was required to be the primary diagnosis of the AN group; participants with comorbid psychiatric conditions, other than psychotic conditions, were not excluded as this would not have represented a typical AN sample. 

Premorbid intelligence was estimated using the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR;  ). Eating disorder symptomatology was investigated with the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q;  ) and alexithymia with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20;  ) (  Table   ).

### Task 
  
Participants were presented with face stimuli from a standard set of black-and-white images, the Pictures of Facial Affect ( ). The stimuli consist of male and female images displaying the seven basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral. The stimuli chosen were those with the highest inter-rater agreement for all seven emotions. Four male and four female models displaying each emotion were presented. Participants were first presented with an implicit task while undergoing fMRI and eyetracking, followed by the explicit task which involved emotion identification and eyetracking. An implicit task was undertaken during fMRI as explicit tasks have a higher cognitive demand and more frontal areas involvement, making it more difficult to observe activity in areas involved in emotion processing ( ;  ). In the implicit task, participants were presented with each stimulus twice in a pseudorandom fashion, resulting in a total of 16 presentations of each emotion over two runs. In the explicit task, participants were shown each stimulus once, resulting in eight presentations per emotion over one run. Due to the extended length of the task in the MRI, participants were not presented with surprised faces in the implicit task as it is the most ambiguous emotion, having neither a positive or negative emotional valence. Participants were also pseudorandomly presented with a black-and-white image of their own face with a neutral expression, with 16 presentations during the implicit task and eight during the explicit task. Photographs of participants were taken by the researcher while participants were instructed to look straight ahead with a relaxed expression, similarly to a passport photograph. Participants’ own face photographs were edited to match the properties of the Ekman face stimuli in terms of size and resolution, and were made black-and-white. 

In the implicit task, faces were displayed pseudorandomly across emotions for 8000 ms on a white background, followed by a black 1° fixation cross for 3000–4300 ms. Each photograph was 336 × 640 pixels, equalling 17 cm × 27.5 cm or 18 × 13° at the eye. Participants were instructed simply to look at the face while it was on screen and to make a gender response with their right hand by clicking one of two buttons only when the fixation cross appeared following the face presentation. Long periods of fixation, between 10200 and 11400 ms were presented pseudorandomly throughout the task to increase BOLD signal variance by allowing the signal to return to baseline. Each of the two runs also began with a long period of fixation for 15000 ms. 

In the explicit task, faces were again displayed for 8000 ms on a white background, equalling to 8 × 13° to the eye. Prior to the presentation of each stimulus, a 1° fixation cross appeared in the center of the screen. Following the presentation of each face stimulus, a forced-choice screen appeared on the monitor asking participants to identify the emotion displayed in the previous face from a list containing all of the emotions. The participants were given as much time as they required to make a response. 


### Data Acquisition and Analysis 
  
#### Eyetracking 
  
Stimuli were presented through SR Research’s Experiment Builder program, and eyetracking was recorded using a remote view eyetracker, the EyeLink1000 (SR Research, Mississauga, ON, Canada), monocularly at 500 Hz. The recorded data were analyzed with SR Research’s analysis program, DataViewer. Areas of interest (AOIs) were defined as the eyes, nose and mouth. To investigate the proportion of fixations and fixation durations to salient features and non-salient features, two spatial-temporal parameters were calculated: the feature fixation index (FFI) and the feature duration index (FDI;  ). The FFI is derived by dividing the number of fixations to salient features minus the number of fixations to non-salient features by the total number of fixations. The FDI is derived in the same manner. Indices range from -1 to +1, with positive values indicating more fixations or longer durations to salient features, and negative values indicating more visual attention to non-salient features. 


#### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
  
Magnetic resonance imaging scans were undertaken with the Siemens Tim Trio 3 tesla system with a 32 channel head coil at Swinburne University of Technology (Melbourne, VIC, Australia). During each functional run of active task performance, 1080 T2 -weighted images were acquired axially parallel to the AC–PC line using an interleaved multiband sequence (multiband acceleration factor = 4, bandwidth = 25988 Hz/Px, repetition time (TR) = 710 ms, echo-time (TE) = 30 ms, echo-spacing = 0.51 ms, flip-angle = 52°, field of view = 222 mm, voxel resolution = 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm, slice thickness = 3 mm, number of slices = 44). Multiband acquisition sequences were derived from the Human Connectome Project ( ). A T1-weighted image was acquired sagitally for anatomical reference (bandwidth = 170 Hz/Px, TR = 1900 ms, TE = 2.52 ms, echo spacing = 7.5 ms, flip angle = 9°, field-of-view = 350 mm × 263 mm × 350 mm, voxel resolution = 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm, slice thickness = 1 mm). 

Magnetic resonance imaging data pre-processing and statistical analyses were performed using SPM8, through Matlab R2014a (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Image pre-processing included image realignment, then coregistration of the T1 image to a mean realigned functional image created during realignment. The co-registered T1 image was normalized to the T1 template supplied with SPM8 Montreal Neuroimaging Institute (MNI), then the parameters of this transformation were applied to realigned functional images. The normalized functional images were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm × 8 mm × 8 mm.

First-level modeling was performed by fitting a convolved hemodynamic response function (HRF) and its temporal derivative separately to the onset times of angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad, neutral, and own faces (seven regressors plus their temporal derivative). After parameter estimation, each emotion parameter and the participants’ own face parameter was contrasted with the neutral face parameter producing six contrast images (angry > neutral, sad > neutral, etc.). At the group level, these contrast images were first entered into one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for AN and HC groups separately to investigate within-group effects (results are presented in Supplementary Material). Group differences were interrogated with a mixed-effects ANOVA model using the flexible factorial option in SPM8. This model included a between-subjects   group   factor (two levels: patients vs. controls), a within subjects   condition   factor (six levels: angry > neutral, sad > neutral, etc.) and a   subject  s factor (number of levels equals the number of participants) that controlled for within-subject variability ( ). 

 T  -statistic images were corrected for multiple comparisons using the random-field theory approach at the voxel and cluster levels (  p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected). The mixed-design analysis involved the investigation of a group by condition interaction, followed by simple effects comparing each condition between groups. 

Following the mixed-design analysis, clusters which resulted in significant differences between groups were defined as different regions of interests (ROIs) with the MarsBar toolbox ( ) run under Matlab R2014a. Contrast estimates for each ROI were correlated with eyetracking and behavioral data, and scores on the EDE-Q and TAS-20. 

Performance on eyetracking components and emotion identification (rate of emotion identification errors) were compared with mixed design ANOVAs, following normality checking and the removal of outliers. Percentage data underwent an arcsine transformation prior to inclusion in ANOVAs. Violations of sphericity were corrected with a Greenhouse–Geiser correction. For conditions in which groups significantly differed in emotion identification error rate, Mann–Whitney   U   tests were carried out to identify which emotions were incorrectly reported as the data were not normally distributed. Pearson’s correlation analyses were also performed between eyetracking data and behavioral data, and scores on the EDE-Q and TAS-20. For brevity, only significant interactions with group will be commented on in detail. Detailed results of eyetracking and fMRI analyses unrelated to group interactions are available as Supplementary Material. 




## Results 
  
### Behavioral 
  
For rate of emotion identification errors, a 2 (group) × 8 (condition) mixed design ANOVA was undertaken (see Supplementary Table  ). The analysis revealed a significant main effect of condition [  F  (2.5,113.5) = 7.4,   p   < 0.001]. A significant main effect of group [  F  (1,46) = 5.2,   p   ≤ 0.05] and a significant interaction between group and condition were also found [  F  (2.5,113.5) = 4.6,   p   ≤ 0.01]. Within subjects contrasts revealed that groups did not significantly differ in emotion identification errors to any individual emotion, but AN participants made significantly more emotion identification errors to their own face [  F  (1,46) = 5.1,   p   ≤ 0.05]. When errors were made to own face emotion, analyses revealed that AN participants were more likely than controls to report their own face as sad [  U  (46) = 200.0, Z = -2.9,   p   ≤ 0.01], whereas control participants were more likely to correctly report their own neutral face as portraying a neutral expression [  U  (46) = 209.0,   Z   = -2.3,   p   ≤ 0.05] (see Supplementary Table  ). 


### Eyetracking 
  
Average fixation count, fixation duration, and saccade amplitude were analyzed in separate 2 (group) × 7 (condition) × 2 (task) mixed design ANOVAs. As the first run of the fMRI task consisted of the same number of trials as the behavioral task, these two tasks were included in the analysis. Furthermore, as the behavioral task also consisted of surprised faces which were not included in the fMRI task, these trials were excluded from the analysis. Means and SD for fixation count, fixation duration and saccade amplitude are presented in see Supplementary Table  . 

For fixation count, a significant main effect of condition [  F  (4.1,159.2) = 3.0,   p   ≤ 0.05] was found with a greater number of fixations made to participants’ own faces and faces depicting anger and fear. A significant main effect was also found for group [  F  (1,39) = 5.3,   p   ≤ 0.05], with AN participants making more fixations than controls. A significant interaction between condition and task was also found [  F  (3.4,131.9) = 7.61,   p   < 0.001] with a decreased number of fixations between implicit and explicit tasks for participants’ own faces and faces depicting fear. There was, however, no significant main effect of task, and no significant interaction between condition and group, or task and group. There was also no interaction between condition, group and task. Analyses conducted on fixation duration revealed a significant main effect of group [  F  (1,38) = 8.5,   p   ≤ 0.01] with AN participants making fixations of shorter duration than heathy individuals. No other significant main effects or interactions were found. Analyses conducted on saccade amplitude resulted in no significant main effects or interactions. 

A 2 (group) × 7 (condition) × 2 (task) mixed design ANOVA conducted on the FDI revealed a significant main effect of condition [  F  (2.3,82.0) = 16.4,   p   < 0.001], and a significant interaction between condition and task [  F  (4.0,144.9) = 3.0,   p   ≤ 0.05] with greater attention to salient features of one’s own face during the implicit compared to explicit task. Analyses conducted on the FFI revealed significant main effects of condition [  F  (2.2,72.5) = 19.7,   p   < 0.001] and task [  F  (1,33) = 10.1,   p   ≤ 0.01] with greater attention to salient facial features during the explicit task compared to the implicit task. Significant interactions were also found between condition and task [  F  (3.8,125.9) = 3.1,   p   ≤ 0.05] and condition and group [  F  (2.2,72.5) = 3.2,   p   ≤ 0.05]. Within-subjects contrasts did not reveal any significant differences between groups for any emotion, but a significant difference for own faces between AN and control participants [  F  (1,33) = 5.9,   p   ≤ 0.05]. Further 2 (group) × 2 (task) mixed design ANOVAs were also conducted on the FFI and FDI to participants’ own face. A significant main effect of task, and an interaction between task and group were not found for either the FFI or FDI. A significant main effect of group was, however, found for both the FFI [  F  (1,36) = 7.6,   p   > 0.01] and FDI [  F  (1,36) = 6.8,   p   ≤ 0.05] (see Supplementary Table  ). Control participants showed more visual attention to salient features of their own face, whereas the attention shown to salient and non-salient features of their own face in AN was roughly equal. 


### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
  
#### Mixed Design Analysis 
  
The analysis did not result in a significant group by condition interaction. Simple effects between groups for each condition revealed a significant difference between groups only for the own > neutral face contrast. Increased activation was found in AN compared to controls in the own > neutral contrast in two clusters: one in the right inferior temporal and middle temporal gyri, and one in the right lingual gyrus (  Table   ;   Figure   ).

The color scale indicates the   t  -value.

### Pearson’s Correlations 
  
BOLD activity in the own > neutral face contrast in either the inferior and middle temporal gyri ROI, or the lingual gyrus ROI did not significantly correlate with any eyetracking parameter, rate of emotion identification errors, or the results of the EDE-Q and TAS-20 for either group. Eyetracking and behavioral data, and scores on the EDE-Q and TAS-20 were also not found to correlate with one another. 



## Discussion 
  
The aim of this study was to investigate own face processing and the processing of emotional faces of others, in individuals with AN. Although the AN group were found to have higher alexithymia scores, they did not differ from healthy controls in emotion identification of the Ekman emotional face stimuli. Groups were found to differ in visual scanpath behavior to the stimuli in general, with AN participants demonstrating hyperscanning, evinced by increased fixations of shorter duration, relative to controls. AN participants were also found to avoid visually attending to salient features of their own face and displayed increased activity in the right lingual, and inferior and middle temporal gyri to images of their own face, compared to neutral control images, as well as to healthy individuals. 

In analyses directly comparing AN to healthy individuals, AN participants showed increased activity to their own face in the right inferior and middle temporal gyri, and lingual gyrus, areas related to higher-order visual perception. Increased activity of the lingual gyrus has been reported during the processing of human faces ( ), and increased activity in the inferior and middle temporal gyri have been specifically found in response to own face stimuli ( ;  ;  ). Therefore, the findings of the current study suggest an increased processing of own face stimuli in AN in areas related to visual perception of self. 

Differences in lingual gyrus and temporal gyrus activity have also been reported when individuals with AN are presented with images of their own body compared to other individuals’ bodies. However, increased activity in these areas was found for controls relative to AN participants ( ;  ), rather than increased activity in AN as found in the current study. However, neither of those studies actually involved face processing; rather, the faces of the stimuli presented in those studies were masked when presented to participants. Therefore, the differences in activation between the current findings and the findings of these two studies may be related to the specific processing of self-face and self-body images which result in increased activity and decreased activity in these areas in AN respectively. 

Our AN group also showed more visual attention to non-salient features and avoided fixating on salient features of their own face.   reported that when AN participants were presented with whole body images of themselves, less visual attention was allocated to their faces compared to controls, though the level of visual attention to different body areas did not differ. Furthermore,   reported a similar pattern of visual attention in a study which presented AN and control participants with food and non-food images simultaneously: although healthy individuals showed more visual attention to food stimuli, the AN group displayed roughly equal attention to food and non-food stimuli. These results may be related to the finding that decreased visual attention is associated with the presentation of anxiety-inducing and phobic stimuli. Similarly to the current findings,   reported that individuals with social anxiety disorder made fixations of short duration to salient features of emotional faces stimuli.  , reported that individuals with spider phobia displayed fewer fixations to spider images and instead diverted their attention to neutral areas of the stimulus. The authors described this behavior as a strategy to cope with threatening and confrontational stimuli, to consequently reduce anxiety. Individuals with AN may utilize similar strategies when viewing their own face as they may find these stimuli anxiety-provoking. An avoidance of salient features was not, however, found to the Ekman face stimuli, suggesting that this behavior is specific to one’s own face. 

Hyperscanning of face stimuli (increased fixations of shorter duration) was also found in our AN group, though this was not specific to self-face images. Hyperscanning behaviors are associated with increased anxiety, as has been reported in social anxiety disorder to face stimuli of different emotions ( ).   suggested the hyperscanning behavior in social anxiety disorder may reflect a fear of social evaluation. This explanation may also be relevant to the current findings: due to a preoccupation with physical appearance, individuals with AN are particularly sensitive to social evaluations made by others ( ) and may show increased scanning behaviors to related stimuli. 

Despite previous reports of emotion identification deficits in individuals with AN, our findings do not concur. Although higher levels of alexithymia were found in the AN group, the ability to identify emotions from a standard set of face stimuli did not differ from healthy individuals. This finding is consistent with the literature which suggests that alexithymia levels are not related to the ability to perceive emotion from faces (see   for a review). However, whether high alexithymia impairs the ability to perceive emotion in an image of one’s own face has not been investigated, nor was it specifically investigated in this study, as we only presented participants with own-face images showing a neutral expression. Although the majority of AN participants reported their own face as portraying a neutral expression, they were more likely than controls to report their own face as depicting a sad expression. However, rather than indicating an emotion identification deficit specific to themselves, this result is more likely to reflect a biased self-perception in how individuals with AN   feel   they look. Thus, when identification errors occurred as they viewed their own faces, they were specific to seeing themselves as sad and not any other emotions. Furthermore, when participants were questioned following the task about their overall experience, the controls often reported that they found it ‘funny’ looking at their own face, whereas AN patients tended to feel disgusted. 

Though AN and control participants differed in the processing of their own face, we found no differences in BOLD activity in response to different emotions, in either group. As strict thresholding was utilized in an attempt to correct for multiple comparisons, the task may not have had sufficient power to document significant differences in activation of each emotion relative to the neutral face condition. However, as the contrasts between participants’ own face and the neutral face condition survived this threshold, the results show that BOLD activity elicited in response to the different emotions was not as strong. Since we were interested in assessing the visual scanpaths of AN patients to face stimuli, the extended presentation time was required for this purpose and the number of trials was therefore limited to remain within a reasonable duration for an MRI task. In future research, where visual scanpaths are not of interest, an increased number of trials should be utilized. It would also be of interest to investigate differences in visual scanpaths and neural activity to both own-face and own-body stimuli in AN, and an evaluation of how these images make AN patients feel. 

The findings of this study have important potential clinical implications. Participants with AN did not differ from healthy control participants in the areas of attentional focus when viewing the Ekman face stimuli, nor did they differ in emotion identification of these stimuli. AN participants did, however, display an avoidance of salient features of images of their own faces. This may have consequently led to the mislabelling of their own neutral expression as sad. In other words, the perception of one’s own face with a neutral expression as appearing sad in AN may be related to patients not looking at the correct areas of their own face when making an affect judgment. This may be as a result of emotional disturbances and alexithymia in AN, or this alternatively may lead to these disturbances. Therefore, remediation techniques which train participants to focus on the correct areas of the face may be beneficial in AN. These techniques have proven useful in other psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, with trained individuals demonstrating an improvement in attention to salient facial features and emotion recognition ( ;  ). Furthermore, the majority of deficits reported in the current study were specific to the processing of self-images in AN. This emphasizes the importance of therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy to address distorted perceptions of oneself in AN and correctly analyzing events and the patient’s own internal dialog. It is also possible that the sense of disgust evoked by viewing their own face also reduced the AN group’s fixations on the salient regions of images of their own faces, in the way that one might avoid eye contact with a repellent individual. 

In summary, this study suggests intact emotion identification of facial affect stimuli and distinct hyperscanning behaviors when viewing faces in AN. Significant differences were also found in the processing of one’s own face in AN, with AN participants showing a greater level of visual attention to non-salient features and increased activity in inferior and middle temporal, and lingual gyri, relative to healthy individuals. These findings suggest overlap with anxiety disorders, as evinced by the hyperscanning behaviors displayed, and increased anxiety, particularly to own face images evinced by an apparent avoidance of salient features. Together with the fMRI finding, the study suggests that the processing of self-face images is different in AN, and may contribute to the distorted perception of oneself experienced by individuals with this illness.

The Brain Mechanisms Underlying the Perception of Pungent Taste of Capsaicin and the Subsequent Autonomic Responses

# Keywords

autonomic function


# Abstract
 
In a human fMRI study, it has been demonstrated that tasting and ingesting capsaicin activate the ventral part of the middle and posterior short gyri (M/PSG) of the insula which is known as the primary gustatory area, suggesting that capsaicin is recognized as a taste. Tasting and digesting spicy foods containing capsaicin induce various physiological responses such as perspiration from face, salivation, and facilitation of cardiovascular activity, which are thought to be caused through viscero-visceral autonomic reflexes. However, this does not necessarily exclude the possibility of the involvement of higher-order sensory-motor integration between the M/PSG and anterior short gyrus (ASG) known as the autonomic region of the insula. To reveal a possible functional coordination between the M/PSG and ASG, we here addressed whether capsaicin increases neural activity in the ASG as well as the M/PSG using fMRI and a custom-made taste delivery system. Twenty subjects participated in this study, and three tastant solutions: capsaicin, NaCl, and artificial saliva (AS) were used. Group analyses with the regions activated by capsaicin revealed significant activations in the bilateral ASG and M/PSG. The fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals in response to capsaicin stimulation were significantly higher in ASG than in M/PSG regardless of the side. Concomitantly, capsaicin increased the fingertip temperature significantly. Although there was no significant correlation between the fingertip temperatures and BOLD signals in the ASG or M/PSG when the contrast [Capsaicin–AS] or [Capsaicin–NaCl] was computed, a significant correlation was found in the bilateral ASG when the contrast [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS] was computed. In contrast, there was a significant correlation in the hypothalamus regardless of the contrasts. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between M/PSG and ASG. These results indicate that capsaicin increases neural activity in the ASG as well as the M/PSG, suggesting that the neural coordination between the two cortical areas may be involved in autonomic responses to tasting spicy foods as reflected in fingertip temperature increases. 
 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
Capsaicin is the pungent ingredient of hot red pepper and has long been traditionally used as ingredient of spices, preservatives, and medicine ( ). In response to tasting and digesting spicy foods containing capsaicin, various physiological responses such as perspiration from face ( ), salivation ( ) and increases of systolic blood pressure, heart rate, body core, and surface temperatures ( ) are transiently induced. Such autonomic responses may be induced through viscero-visceral autonomic reflexes ( ). The exact neuroanatomical basis of these reflexes is not firmly established, but it is generally believed that capsaicin activates nociceptive afferents innervating the oral organs and gut, which in turn activates sympathetic nervous system, causing facilitation of cardiovascular activity as a result of viscero-visceral reflex. It is also reported that capsaicin accelerates adrenaline secretion by activating the adrenal sympathetic efferent nerve in rats ( ). However, this does not necessarily exclude the possibility of the involvement of higher-order sensory-motor integration. 

Since capsaicin activates the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) on primary afferent neurons ( ), capsaicin-induced autonomic reflexes might be caused by impulse activity in nociceptive afferents innervating oral mucosa and taste bud expressing TRPV1 ( ;  ;  ). In the rat insular cortex, the dysgranular region is involved in taste perception as the primary gustatory area ( ;  ), while its caudal granular region is potentially involved in visceral sensory-motor control as the primary autonomic area ( ;  ;  ). Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging and whole cell recording in rat slice preparations, we recently demonstrated that theta-band oscillatory neural coordination between the gustatory and autonomic insular cortices can be induced by activation of TRPV1 in the insular cortex ( ). Therefore, it may be possible that not only the viscero-visceral reflex but also such a neural coordination induced by TRPV1 activation is responsible for the autonomic responses to tasting and ingesting spicy foods. 

Immunohistochemical studies revealed that TRPV1 is expressed in epithelial cells ( ) and taste buds mainly in the circumvallate papillae ( ) of the human tongue. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in human subjects demonstrated that the tasting and swallowing of 44 μM capsaicin cause excitation in the primary gustatory area, the ventral part of the middle and posterior short gyri (M/PSG) of the insular cortex ( ), suggesting that capsaicin is perceived as hot and spicy tastes. On the other hand, the anterior short gyrus (ASG) of the insular cortex has been identified as the center for the autonomic sensory-motor integration in recent fMRI studies ( ;  ;  ). This anatomical arrangement of the gustatory and autonomic areas in the insular cortex is very similar to that of the rat, suggesting a possibility of neural coordination between M/PSG and ASG. However, it has not been investigated whether the oral administration of capsaicin at a higher concentration activates not only M/PSG but also ASG and whether such ASG activation is involved in autonomic responses in human subjects. We here demonstrate that the tasting and ingestion of 65 μM capsaicin activated ASG as well as M/PSG and a significant correlation was found between the effects size of fMRI BOLD signals in the bilateral ASG but not in M/PSG and the fingertip temperature increases. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Subjects 
  
Experiments were performed on 20 healthy subjects (16 males and four females; aged 20–36 years) without any history of neuromuscular disorder or injury to their brain. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before the experiment. Ethical approval from the ethical committee of the National Institute for Physiological Sciences and the ethical committee of Osaka University were obtained before the experiment. 


### Stimulus Solution 
  
The following three solutions were used as tastants: artificial saliva (AS), 65 μM capsaicin, and 0.75 M NaCl dissolved in deionized water. The concentrations of capsaicin and NaCl were determined to be approximately equally intense based on psychophysiological tests ( ). NaCl solution at this concentration is widely used as a salty tastant ( ;  ), and a limited application of 1 M NaCl did not cause aversive sensation ( ). It was confirmed in all the subjects participated that 0.3 mL NaCl solution at 0.75 M did not cause aversive sensation. AS was composed of a 12.5 mM KCl and 1.25 mM NaHCO  solution similar to the ionic components of saliva ( ). All solutions were delivered at a room temperature (22–24°C) as any effects of temperature, which is known to be represented in the insular cortex ( ), could not have contributed to any of the effects described in our investigation. 


### Stimulus Delivery System 
  
A custom designed taste delivery system was built to administer the liquid stimuli. The three tastants were delivered into the subject’s mouth through the three tygon tubes, one ends of which were connected to the three storage bottles suspended from the ceiling and the other ends were introduced into the mouth to reach the posterior one third of the tongue after the tubes were attached to the incisor region of a rigid custom made mandibular mouthguard with dental resin bonding. The flow of the tastants was controlled by the respective solenoid valves (  Figure   ). The opening and shunting of respective solenoid valves, which were placed outside the MRI scanner room, were independently controlled by a personal computer to apply tastant solutions at a constant flow rate of 0.1 ml/s. Tastants were applied to the posterior one third of the subject’s tongue based on the following three rationales: (1) Taste cells which express TRPV1 receptors are mostly located in the circumvallate papillae which are localized in the posterior one third of the human tongue ( ). (2) The strength of compound sensation of taste and burning pain evoked by capsaicin application to the posterior tongue is higher compared to the anterior tongue, regardless of concentrations of capsaicin ( ;  ). (3) None of taste neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius in rats displayed prominent excitatory responses to capsaicin application to the anterior tongue ( ). 
  
 A custom designed taste delivery system and experimental design. (A)   A schematic diagram of tastants delivery system. Tastants delivered through the three tygon tubes, the tastant flow through which was regulated by the respective solenoid valves that are controlled by a personal computer. Three solutions; artificial saliva (AS), capsaicin (Cap), and NaCl were administered at 0.1 ml/s constant flow rate.   (Ba–c)   NaCl event for 3 s (blue bar) followed by AS event for 3 s (gray bar) with an interevent interval of 20 s was applied six times every 20 s (one NaCl session)   (a)  . AS event for 3 s (gray bar) followed by AS event for 3 s (gray bar) with an interevent interval of 20 s was applied six times every 20 s (one AS session)   (b)  . Capsaicin event (red bar) for 3 s followed by five 3 s AS events (gray bar) applied every 20 s was repeated two times with an interval of 138 s. A paired capsaicin block   (c)   which contains two capsaicin events was repeated 3 times every 10 min (one capsaicin session). Subjects pressed the button as soon as they felt a liquid on their tongue (bottom). 
  

### Experimental Design 
  
One NaCl block consisted of a 3 s NaCl event and a 3 s AS event applied after a rest period of 20 s (  Figure   ), which was repeatedly applied six times every 20 s (one NaCl-session). One AS block consisted of two 3 s AS events separated by 20 s (  Figure   ), which was repeatedly applied six times every 20 s (one AS-session). A pair of capsaicin blocks, each of which contains a 3 s capsaicin event followed by five 3 s AS events repeated every 20 s, was applied with an inter-block interval of 20 s, consequently spanning about 5 min (  Figure   ). Because one MRI scan time was limitted to be about 5 min to keep the subject’s attention on the task, a pair of capsaicin blocks was repeated three times every 10 min to constitute one capsaicin session. AS events after taste event application were considered as rinse events. In order to obtain a sufficient number of trials for averaging, each subjects participated in one NaCl-session, one AS-session and one capsaicin-session in the morning and in the same sessions in the afternoon on the same day. Consequently, 24 AS events, 12 NaCl events, and 12 capsaicin events were used for fMRI data analysis. 


### Subject Preparation 
  
Subjects were instructed not to change their head positions, and to keep their eyes open to watch a fixation point in front of them. Subjects held a response button in their right hand and pressed the button as soon as possible they felt a liquid touch on their tongue (  Figure   , bottom). The button press was required to average the respective fMRI responses to a tastant which was repeatedly applied, and was used to obtain a positive control for fMRI. And also, they were asked to briefly take a swallow of solution for 1 s between fMRI data scanning so that BOLD signal was not contaminated by movement artifacts related to swallowing. Prior to MRI scan, subjects were given a description of the paradigm and were asked to participate in a training session in a laboratory. The training session served to screen subjects, familiarize subjects with the procedures and equipment used during the actual scan, and make sure that they could press the button at a probability of 90% or higher and take a swallow of solution in correct timing. 


### MRI Data Acquisition 
  
All images were acquired using a 3T MR scanner (Allegra; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). For functional imaging during the sessions, a T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) procedure was used to produce 3-mm-thick slices (34 in total) with a 17% gap covering the entire cerebral and cerebellar cortices [repetition time (TR) = 3000 ms; echo time (TE) = 30 ms; flip angle (FA) = 83°; the field of view (FOV) = 192 mm; 64 × 64 matrix with a pixel dimension of 3.0 × 3.0 mm]. The acquisition time (TA) was set at 2000 ms, so as to obtain a 1000-ms “silent period” without any magnetic-field gradient or radiofrequency pulse. This was intended to avoid contaminating motion artifacts by swallowing to the BOLD signal. In total, 960 volumes (96 volumes per run) were acquired. For anatomical imaging, high-resolution whole-brain MR images were also obtained using a T1-weighted three-dimensional (3D) magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TR = 2500 ms; TE = 4.38 ms; FA = 8°; FOV = 230 mm; one slab; 192 slices per slab; voxel dimensions = 0.9 mm × 0.9 mm × 1.0 mm). 


### Fingertip Temperature Measurement 
  
Body surface temperature at the left little fingertip was measured as indicator of thermogenesis with an electronic thermometer system: thermistor (TSD202A, BIOPAC, Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, USA), skin temperature amplifier module (SKT100C, BIOPAC, Biopac Systems), data acquisition system (Powerlab, ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA) and Power Lab Chart Ver.5 (Powerlab, ADInstruments), during fMRI data acquisition. The TSD202A thermistor which can be reliably used under the condition of 3T-MR scanner (MR conditional) was attached to the skin with surgical tape. Temperature changes following application of tastants were obtained by calculating the fingertip average temperature for 15 s before and after respective sessions as controls and effects of tastants, respectively. The fingertip temperature depends on the rate of blood flow or vascular activity that is regulated by autonomic nervous system ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). 


### fMRI Data Processing 
  
The first two volumes of each run were discarded due to unsteady magnetization, and the remaining 94 volumes per run (a total of 940 volumes per subject for 10 runs) were used for the analysis. Image processing and statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM8; The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) implemented in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Functional images from each run were realigned to the mean image of all functional images to correct for motion. After the motion correction, the T1-weighted anatomical image was coregistered to the mean image, and then normalized to a standard T1 template image, which defined the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The parameters from this normalization process were then applied to each functional image. The spatially normalized EPI images were filtered using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) in the   x  ,   y  , and   z   axes. 


### fMRI Data Analysis 
  
Initially, we performed a single-subject level analysis. The individual task-related activity was estimated using a general linear model ( ). The signal time-course of each subject was modeled with a boxcar function convolved with a canonical haemodynamic-response function (included in SPM8), a high pass filter (with a cut-off period of 128 s), and session effects. For each NaCl run, we included one regressor for NaCl event, one for wash event, and six regressors for six parameters (three displacements and three rotations) from rigid-body realignment stage. For each capsaicin run, we included each one regressor for capsaicin event, one for the first- to fourth-wash event, one for fifth-wash event, and six regressors from the realignment. For the AS run, we included one regressor for AS event and six regressors from the realignment. Serial autocorrelation of the fMRI time series was modeled using a first-order autoregressive model. The resulting set of voxel values for each comparison constituted a statistical parametric map of the   t   statistic [SPM {  t  }]. 

The weighted sum of the parameters estimated in the individual analyses consisted of “contrast” images, which were used for the group-level analyses. The contrast images obtained from each individual analysis represented the normalized increment of the fMRI signal for each subject. The contrast images of each condition were entered into a flexible factorial model for a multi-subject repeated measured analysis of variance (ANOVA) with subject (one-level for each subject) and event (three levels consisted of capsaicin, NaCl, and AS conditions) factors. To identify regions of overlapping responses to the three or two different tastes events, we performed conjunction analyses with a conjunction null hypothesis. This statistic identifies voxels that are significantly activated in each of the individual contrasts included in the conjunction ( ). Furthermore, the three types of the contrast of interest [Capsaicin–AS], [Capsaicin–NaCl], and [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS] were computed to reveal the regions that are selectively or more potentially activated by capsaicin. The statistical threshold was set at   p   < 0.05 with correction of the family-wise error (FWE) at the voxel level, and the resulting set of voxel values for each comparison constituted a statistical parametric map of the   t   statistic [SPM{  t  }]. 

We performed ROI analysis using anatomically defined insular cortex, which was determined by using WFU pickatlas tool ( ). We extracted effect size regarding to each condition from the anatomically defined insula. Numerical data were expressed as the mean ± SD. Then, we assessed statistical significance in non-pairwise and pairwise experiments using repeated-measures ANOVA with Fisher’s protected least significant difference   post hoc   test (STATISTICA 10J, StatSoft), and Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the effect sizes and the fingertip temperature changes. Statistical analysis of the fingertip temperature changes was performed with a paired   t  -test (  p   < 0.05). 



## Results 
  
### Conjunction Analysis of All Taste Stimuli 
  
To investigate which areas are commonly activated by the three taste stimuli, we first performed a conjunction analysis between all the responses to the respective taste stimuli (  Figure    and   Table   ). Most prominently activated brain areas were bilateral anterior insula (-32, 18, 8;   T   = 12.15 and 36, 22, 4;   T   = 10.84), which were included in the largest cluster together with bilateral middle insula (-34, -6, 14;   T   = 9.85 and 38, -2, 12;   T   = 6.61,   Figure   ), left postcentral gyrus (-54, -22, 20;   T   = 11.00,   Figures   ) and left precentral gyrus (-52, 4, 10;   T   = 9.06,   Figures   ) as represented with multiple peaks. These results indicate that the insula and postcentral gyri were activated following application of tastants on subject’s tongue and the precentral gyrus was activated during pressing the button, suggesting that the fMRI data revealing the activation of the insular cortices are reliable. Bilateral supplementary motor area, bilateral middle cingulate cortex, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral cerebellum were also activated (  Table   ). These results were completely the same as the results obtained by performing a conjunction analysis of two different tastes [Capsaicin and NaCl].

### The Cortical Regions that Display Stronger Responses to Capsaicin Compared to NaCl or AS 
  
We next investigated the cortical regions which are more strongly activated by capsaicin than by NaCl or AS. First, we performed the group analyses of the two types of comparisons; [Capsaicin–AS] (  Figure    and   Table   ) and [Capsaicin–NaCl] (  Figure    and   Table   ). Activated brain areas revealed by the two comparisons were the bilateral anterior insula and bilateral middle insula (  Figures    and    ). The MNI coordinates of peak voxels in anterior and middle insula were the same between the two comparisons. However, no brain areas were found to be significantly activated with the comparison [NaCl–AS] (data not shown; see Discussion).

We next performed the group analysis of the comparison [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS] to reveal which voxels were significantly and more potentially activated by capsaicin compared to NaCl or AS (  Figure    and   Table   ). Brain areas particularly activated by capsaicin stimuli were the bilateral anterior insula (  Figures   ), bilateral middle insula (  Figures   ), right superior medial gyrus (  Figure   ), right caudate nucleus (  Figure   ), postcentral gyrus (  Figure   ), ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) of left thalamus (  Figure   ). Highly significant activations were found in the following coordinates; [38, 20, 4] (  T   = 10.43; the right anterior insula), [–32, 18, 6] (  T   = 9.79; the left anterior insula), [–32, –4, 14] (  T   = 8.36; the left middle insula) and [–6, 16, 26] (  T   = 7.26; the left anterior cingulate cortex). These cortices are known to play crucial roles for blood pressure control, among human central autonomic network ( ). Significant activation was also observed in the hypothalamus [–6, –8, –2] (  T   = 5.41), which is the subcortical autonomic control center ( ). This region was included in a cluster of left thalamus (  Table   ).

### Differential Activation of the Short Insular Gyri Following Capsaicin Application 
  
The human insular cortex usually contains five major gyri: the anterior three gyri (  Figure   ) referred to as the “short” gyri and the posterior two gyri termed as the “long” gyri ( ). The three short gyri were termed as the ASG and M/PSG. To investigate the possible differential activation in the insular cortex, ROI analysis was made at the peak coordinates (  Figure   ) in ASG and M/PSG obtained in the group analysis of the three types of the comparisons; [Capsaicin–AS], [Capsaicin–NaCl], and [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS]. Regardless of the types of comparisons, the effect sizes at the ASG were significantly higher than those at the M/PSG (  Figures   ), suggesting that the ASG was more potentially activated by capsaicin compared to the M/PSG. The effect sizes at the right ASG and M/PSG following capsaicin application were significantly higher compared to the left corresponding gyri (  Figures   , compare left and right red bars).

### Correlation Between Fingertip Temperatures and BOLD Signals 
  
To examine the functional relevance of the more increased activity in the ASG and/or M/PSG in response to capsaicin administration compared to NaCl or AS, we measured the fingertip temperatures before and after the respective tastants application. The mean temperature changes following application of NaCl and AS were insignificant and smaller (0.16 ± 0.47 and 0.23 ± 0.74°C, respectively), while the mean temperature increase following application of capsaicin was significant and larger (0.83 ± 0.85°C;   Figure   ).

(C)   Correlation between the fingertip temperature increases and the effect sizes at respective peak coordinates in the right ASG   (a)   and in the right M/PSG   (b)   obtained in the group analysis of the comparison [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS].

To investigate which areas are more closely involved in the fingertip temperature increases following capsaicin application, we performed correlation analysis between the fingertip temperature increases and the effect sizes of BOLD signals at respective peak coordinates of the three types of the comparisons; [Capsaicin–AS], [Capsaicin–NaCl] and [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS]. There were no significant correlations between the fingertip temperature increases and the effect sizes in the coordinates of both the ASG and M/PSG found as significant in the group analysis of the two comparisons; [Capsaicin–AS] (  p   > 0.05) and [Capsaicin–NaCl] (  p   > 0.05). In contrast, the bilateral ASG in the coordinate found as significant by the comparison [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS] showed a significant positive correlation between fingertip temperatures and its BOLD signals (  Figures   ), while the M/PSG did not show any significant correlation regardless of the side (  Figures   ). Significant correlations were also found in the bilateral VPM of thalamus, left ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of thalamus, right medial dorsal nucleus (MD) of thalamus (Data not shown) and in the hypothalamus regardless of the comparisons (  Figure   ) while no significant correlation was found in the right S1 (  Figure   ). 


### Coordination Between ASG and M/PSG and Between Diencephalon and ASG or M/PSG. 
  
We then performed correlation analysis between the effect sizes in the coordinates of the two cortical regions as found significant in the group analysis of the comparison [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS], given the integration and coordination between the two cortical regions. There was a significant positive correlation between the effect sizes of BOLD signals of the right ASG and the right M/PSG (  Figure   ), while there was no significant correlation between left ASG and the left M/PSG (  Figure   ). Furthermore, no significant correlations were also found between the ASG and M/PSG in the coordinates found as significant in the group analysis of the comparison [Capsaicin–AS] or [Capsaicin–NaCl], (see Discussion). These results suggest the neural coordination between the right M/PSG and ASG potentially in response to capsaicin application as well as the presence of non-linear neural integration among different sensory modalities that occurs during the respective tastants application (see Discussion).

(C)   Correlation between the effect sizes at the peak coordinates in the left VPM and left M/PSG   (a)   and those in the left VPM and left ASG   (b)   obtained in the group analysis of the capsaicin responses.

(F)   Correlation between the effect sizes at the peak coordinates in the right ASG and hypothalamus   (a)   and those in the right M/PSG and hypothalamus   (b)   obtained in the group analysis of the capsaicin responses. 
  
However, to reveal the neural interaction between the subcortical brain region and the cortical region, we performed the correlation analysis between the effect sizes in the coordinates found as significant in the group analysis of the capsaicin responses because there would be no neural integration in the subcortical brain regions. The left and right VPM were significantly correlated with the effect sizes of the left and right M/PSG, respectively (  Figures   , respectively), as the solitary tract carrying the primary taste information projects to the M/PSG through the VPM. The left VPM was not significantly correlated with the left ASG (  Figure   ) while the right VPM was significantly correlated with the right ASG (  Figure   ). These results strongly suggest the neural coordination between the right ASG and M/PSG. Furthermore, there were significant positive correlations between the effect size in the hypothalamus and those in the bilateral ASG (  Figures   ) and the right M/PSG (  Figure   ), but not the left M/PSG (  Figure   ). 



## Discussion 
  
The aim of this study was to investigate whether capsaicin activates the gustatory insular cortex as well as the autonomic insular cortex. We performed the group analyses of the three types of the comparison; [Capsaicin–AS], [Capsaicin–NaCl], and [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS]. Regardless of a difference in these types of comparisons, the significant increases in BOLD signals were observed in the bilateral ASG and M/PSG (  Figures  –   and   Tables   –   ), and also the effect sizes in the left and right ASG obtained in the group analyses of three types of the comparisons were significantly higher than those in the left and right M/PSG (  Figures   ). The fingertip temperature measured after capsaicin application was significantly higher compared to the control whereas no significant temperature changes were observed following application of NaCl or AS (  Figure   ). The bilateral ASG in the coordinate found as significant by the comparison [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS] showed a significant positive correlation between its effect sizes and fingertip temperatures (  Figures   ). These results suggest that capsaicin activated the ASG more selectively and potentially compared to the M/PSG, which may be responsible for autonomic responses reflected in fingertip temperature increases. 

### Can the Tasteless AS be the Control for Tastants in fMRI Responses? 
  
Because AS is tasteless solution, the response to AS has been considered as a control that simply causes tactile sensation in the gustatory insular cortex ( ), and subsequently in many studies ( ;  ;  ;  ), fMRI response to AS was subtracted from those to other taste stimulations. However, in terms of the intensity of the response and the spatial pattern of the excitation in the gustatory insular cortex, it is questionable whether the AS response can be treated as a control. First, it is well known that many different pyramidal neurons, each of which respond to a different stimulus modality, such as tactile, pressure, cold and warm temperatures, pain, and tastes, are intermingled in the gustatory area and there also exist such neurons that respond to multimodal stimulations ( ;  ;  ;  ). All these neurons may be synaptically connected, and non-linear summation of synaptic inputs would take place in respective pyramidal neurons in the gustatory insular cortex in response to any taste stimulation. Thus, a taste recognition occurs in the gustatory insular cortex as a result of non-linear integration of many neuronal activities induced by stimulation of various sensory modalities with a tastant. Then, the subtraction of the AS response from some taste response may not necessarily reveal the pure taste response. Second, fMRI studies demonstrated that respective tastes were represented as specific patterns with considerable overlaps in the gustatory cortex ( ;  ). This suggests that taste recognition is mediated by the activity of a different subset of cell assembly representing differential spatial pattern of excitation, similar to that observed in rats ( ) although it was also reported that each taste quality was represented as a discrete hot spot in the gustatory cortex in mice ( ;  ). Water also causes a spatial pattern of excitation, which was not the same as the overlapping area of any two of four basic tastants ( ). If this is also the case in human subjects, these observations suggest that subtraction of water-like AS response from the response to some tastant may not necessarily reflect the pure taste response and is not the right way of evaluation of taste response. Therefore, provided that AS is a tastant that causes a sensation of tasteless, the group analysis of the comparison [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS] can be an estimate of the area that shows selective or significantly more potential responses to capsaicin application compared to NaCl or AS. The fMRI responses in the left hand area of precentral gyrus (M1) induced by button presses which were performed as soon as the subjects detected the arrival of tastants on the tongue before perceiving tastes did not vary depending on the taste difference among the three tastants, as revealed by the abolishment of the M1 activation by computing the contrast of interest [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS]. Then, even if the button press affects the fMRI taste responses, the button press would cause the same effect on the taste fMRI responses regardless of the different tastants. Therefore, the computing of the contrast of interest [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS] would isolate the taste responses in the taste-associated brain regions to capsaicin application by canceling the possible overlapping activity. Indeed, there were no significant correlations between the temperature changes and the effect sizes in the coordinate found as significant by the comparison [Capsaicin–AS] or [Capsaicin–NaCl] whereas there was a significant correlation between the temperature changes and the effect size in the coordinate found as significant by the comparison [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS]. 


### Reliability of Fingertip Temperature Measurements During MR Scanning 
  
In this study, capsaicin increased the fingertip temperature significantly. The radio frequency (RF) transmitted from the electromagnetic coil may cause a slight increase in the core body temperature inside the MRI bore. However, the left hand little finger is outside the bore, and the temperature loss will occur during blood flow through the forearm into the peripheral endartery in the little finger. Therefore, it is unlikely that MR scanning causes significant changes in the fingertip temperature of the subjects without application of tastants that activate autonomic nervous system. This is also supported by the observation that the temperature changes observed following application of NaCl or AS were statistically insignificant and much smaller than that observed following application of capsaicin (  Figure   ). We calculated the fingertip average temperature for 15 s before and after an entire capsaicin session as a control and an effect of capsaicin application, respectively. In this case, the interval between the two measurements was 35 min (the duration of one capsaicin session, during which a paired capsaicin block repeated three times with 10 min interval), which would be long enough for the development of autonomic responses. Even if the fingertip temperature were increased by RF, 10 min interval is good enough for the recovery of skin temperature to the original value ( ), in contrast to the cumulative effects of capsaicin. 


### Differential Activation Between the ASG and the M/PSG in Response to Capsaicin Application 
  
The M/PSG responds not only to pure taste stimuli as the primary gustatory area but also to stimulation of other intra-oral sensations as an integrated oral sensory region that plays a crucial role in feeding behavior ( ). It has been demonstrated by an fMRI study in human subjects that tasting and swallowing of capsaicin caused excitation in the M/PSG ( ), suggesting that activation of oral TRPV1 receptors by capsaicin caused the hot and spicy sensation in the primary gustatory area of M/PSG. Partly consistent with this previous study, we found that the oral administration of capsaicin activated the bilateral M/PSG while the bilateral ASG were also activated by capsaicin (  Figures   ,   ,   and    ). However, as revealed by the computing of the contrast of interest [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS], the   T  -value and   Z  -score were higher in the ASG than in the M/PSG (  Table   ). Consistent with this observation, the ROI analysis also revealed that in response to capsaicin administration, the effect sizes in the ASG were significantly larger than those in the M/PSG (  Figures   ). These observations suggest that capsaicin may have more significantly and strongly activated the ASG compared to the M/PSG. 

Regardless of the ASG or the M/PSG, the effect sizes were significantly larger in response to capsaicin application compared to NaCl or AS application. Furthermore, in spite of the taste difference between salty NaCl and tasteless AS, there were no differences in the effect sizes between the ASG and M/PSG in response to AS or NaCl and no differences in the effect sizes between the responses to NaCl and AS in the ASG or in the M/PSG. Consistent with this observation, there were no significant brain areas with the comparison [NaCl–AS] (data not shown). However, it should be noted that tastants were delivered to the posterior part of the tongue which expresses TRPV1 receptors more densely compared to the anterior part and is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve ( ) while salty taste of NaCl is mostly sensed in the anterior part which is solely innervated by the chorda tympani nerve ( ). Therefore, the comparison of effects sizes between capsaicin and NaCl or AS or between NaCl and AS does not necessarily reflect the modality difference in the insular cortices. Nevertheless, it can be at least concluded that capsaicin activated the ASG more selectively and potentially compared to the M/PSG. 


### Autonomic Insular Cortex Activated by Capsaicin Application 
  
The insular cortex is composed of functionally diverse subregions, which are involved in gustatory and olfactory processing, somatosensation, interoception, motivation, and the maintenance of homeostasis ( ;  ,  ;  ). The involvement of the insular cortex in autonomic functions has been studied extensively ( ;  ;  ). Anterior insula and left posterior insula are potentially involved in human autonomic functions ( ;  ). Recently, the autonomic functional organization of the insular cortex has been revealed to be gyri-specific by the three autonomic manipulations: Valsalva maneuver, hand grip challenge, and cold pressor challenge ( ). In particular, the ASG was found to be involved in sympathetic regulation as assessed by electrodermal activity and high-frequency heart rate variability ( ). 

Transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure, and tympanic temperature were observed immediately after ingesting, chewing, and spitting out hot red pepper ( ). In the present study, the ASG was more strongly activated by capsaicin compared to the M/PSG (  Figures   ). The fingertip temperature measured after capsaicin application was significantly higher compared to the control (  Figure   ). The bilateral ASG showed a significant positive correlation between fingertip temperatures and BOLD signals (  Figures   ). These results suggest that the ASG plays a crucial role in inducing autonomic responses following capsaicin administration, as reflected in fingertip temperature increases. Furthermore, the significant positive correlations between the effect size in the hypothalamus and those in the bilateral ASG (  Figures   ) suggest that the ASG activity caused an increase in the fingertip temperature through the activation of the hypothalamus. Indeed, the peak coordinate found as significant in the hypothalamus by the group analysis of the capsaicin responses corresponded to the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, which is known to be involved in the control of body temperature ( ). 

After conjunction analysis between all the responses to the respective taste stimuli, insula, and postcentral gyri were prominently activated following application of tastants on subject’s tongue, and the precentral gyrus was activated during pressing the button. Other regions including bilateral supplementary motor area, bilateral middle cingulate cortex, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral cerebellum were also activated (  Table   ). These regions were also reported to be activated by the nociceptive responses to heat, capsaicin, or mechanical stimulation applied to the hand or forearm skin by using positron emission tomography and fMRI ( ). However, the supplementary motor area and cerebellum were known to be involved in the regulation of sympathetic activity ( ), as revealed by significant correlations between fMRI signal and instantaneous high frequency power of heart rate changes ( ). 


### Do Capsaicin-Induced fMRI Responses in the Insular Cortex Represent Pain Perception? 
  
In the present study, capsaicin was applied at a concentration of 65 μM, which is 10–30 times lower than that contained in tabasco sauce and similar to that of curry sauce. In a previous study, capsaicin was applied at 44 μM which caused neither pain sensation nor activation of the ASG ( ). 

Robust activations in the anterior and posterior long gyri (A/PLG) of the insular cortex during nociceptive stimulation were consistently shown in fMRI studies ( ;  ). These posterior parts of the insular cortex together with inner opercular cortices form a first-order nociceptive matrix, and a second-order perceptual matrix is composed of the middle and anterior insular cortices, the anterior cingulate gyrus, anterior frontal, and posterior parietal areas ( ). It was also reported that nociceptive input was first processed in the posterior insula and then conveyed to the anterior insula using Stereo-Electro-Encephalography before neurosurgery ( ). 

In the present study, a group analysis of the comparison [2 × Capsaicin–NaCl–AS] revealed that capsaicin activated the ASG more potentially than the M/PSG without significant activation of the A/PLG (  Figure    and   Table   ). As the A/PLG is the first-order nociceptive matrix, these observations suggest that capsaicin did not cause pain sensation but activated parasympathetic nervous system to cause an increase in the fingertip temperature. Usually, in response to cold acclimation of the fingertip, the contraction of fingertip endartery would be caused by α2 adrenergic action to prevent the temperature loss ( ). However, under the resting condition with oral administration of capsaicin, such adrenergic response would not occur whereas adrenergic action on the heart induced by capsaicin would increase blood flow in the fingertip endartery to increase the fingertip temperature.

Bilateral cerebellar activation in unilaterally challenged essential tremor

# Keywords

Cerebellum


# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common hyperkinetic movement disorders. Previous research into the pathophysiology of ET suggested underlying cerebellar abnormalities. 


## Objective 
  
In this study, we added electromyography as an index of tremor intensity to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (EMG-fMRI) to study a group of ET patients selected according to strict criteria to achieve maximal homogeneity. With this approach we expected to improve upon the localization of the bilateral cerebellar abnormalities found in earlier fMRI studies. 


## Methods 
  
We included 21 propranolol sensitive patients, who were not using other tremor medication, with a definite diagnosis of ET defined by the Tremor Investigation Group. Simultaneous EMG-fMRI recordings were performed while patients were off tremor medication. Patients performed unilateral right hand and arm extension, inducing tremor, alternated with relaxation (rest). Twenty-one healthy, age- and sex-matched participants mimicked tremor during right arm extension. EMG power variability at the individual tremor frequency as a measure of tremor intensity variability was used as a regressor, mathematically independent of the block regressor, in the general linear model used for fMRI analysis, to find specific tremor-related activations. 


## Results 
  
Block-related activations were found in the classical upper-limb motor network, both for ET patients and healthy participants in motor, premotor and supplementary motor areas. In ET patients, we found tremor-related activations bilaterally in the cerebellum: in left lobules V, VI, VIIb and IX and in right lobules V, VI, VIIIa and b, and in the brainstem. In healthy controls we found simulated tremor-related activations in right cerebellar lobule V. 


## Conclusions 
  
Our results expand on previous findings of bilateral cerebellar involvement in ET. We have identified specific areas in the bilateral somatomotor regions of the cerebellum: lobules V, VI and VIII. 

 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
Although essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common hyperkinetic movement disorders ( ), the underlying disease mechanism is poorly understood. ET has long been considered a benign disorder, but opinions about the disabling nature of ET are changing ( ). 

Cerebellar abnormalities are commonly found in investigations of the pathophysiology of ET. Yet, post-mortem studies have provided conflicting results, with cerebellar degeneration reported in some ( ,  ) but not all studies ( ). 

Similarly, neuroimaging results in ET are also incongruent, but do provide support for cerebellar involvement. In structural imaging the most frequent result is cerebellar abnormality in ET, although this is not consistently reported. These reported abnormalities are located in the anterior and posterior lobules of the cerebellum, although not all studies specify the specific areas in the cerebellum ( ). Positron emission tomography experiments consistently report changes in blood flow in the bilateral cerebellum and in some cases in the red nucleus, thalamus and inferior olive during performance of a motor task ( ,  ,  ). Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies, examining motor tasks in ET patients, report abnormalities in widespread areas of in the (bilateral) cerebellum but are not able to point to specific locations due to methodological limitations ( ,  ). Clinically, cerebellar abnormalities would fit well with the presence of symptoms associated with cerebellar malfunction in ET, such as intention tremor ( ,  ). 

Although many of the results point towards the cerebellum, overall studies and especially functional neuroimaging studies, are inconclusive about the specific areas of the cerebellum involved in ET. One cause contributing to this imprecision in findings may be that ‘ET’ used to be the label for ‘tremor not otherwise specified’, resulting in a heterogeneous group with high variability in clinical presentation, response to therapeutic intervention and on etiologic level. In this study, we have attempted to define a more homogeneous group of ET patients by requiring a clear diagnosis and in addition a positive response to propranolol medication. We selected propranolol for this study, as it is a drug that has obtained level A evidence for efficacy in ET ( ). 

Moreover, we improved upon existing functional imaging methodology in ET by combining electromyography (EMG) and fMRI. This novel approach allows recording tremor simultaneously with brain activity and to directly relate tremor to brain activity in the analysis. We expected to improve upon the localization of the bilateral cerebellar abnormalities found in earlier fMRI studies. 


## Methods 
  
### Subjects 
  
This study was conducted in two academic hospitals in The Netherlands: the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) and the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam (AMC). Patients who had a definite diagnosis of ET according to criteria defined by the Tremor Investigation Group were included ( ). All patients had bilateral upper limb tremor, an age at onset < 65 years, and a disease duration > 5 years. A positive family history was present in most patients (see  ) but not required for inclusion. Patients had to report a positive subjective response to propranolol and could not use other tremor medication. Patients and healthy controls (age- and sex-matched) were all right-handed as assessed by the Annett Handedness scale ( ) and had a score > 25 on the Mini Mental State Examination to ensure proper understanding of the task. Exclusion criteria were neurological comorbidity (for patients: other than ET), age < 18 years and the use of medication (other than for ET) affecting the central nervous system. The study was approved by the medical ethical committees of the UMCG and the AMC. This study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki (Seoul, 2008) and all participants gave written informed consent. 


### Study set-up 
  
Patients quit propranolol for a minimum of three days before participating in the study; 3-day withdrawal is sufficient to largely eliminate propranolol taking into account the elimination half-life of 3–6 h or 12 h for the long-acting formulation ( ). Tremor was assessed off medication using the Fahn–Tolosa–Marin Tremor Rating Scale (TRS) ( ) and a visual analog scale (VAS). The TRS is composed of three parts. Part A consists of assessment of tremor amplitude during rest, posture, movement and finger-to-nose maneuvers. Part B consists of tremor-inducing tasks, including writing, two standardized Archimedes spirals, a line-drawing task and a water pouring task. In part C the patients rate the limitations they experience in daily life due to tremor. Part A and B were performed and videotaped for both hands, separately. An experienced movement disorders specialist (J.D.S.) blindly determined TRS scores for part A and B. The range of the total TRS (part A, B and C) is 0–88. The VAS subjectively rated tremor severity, patients marked a 10 cm line ranging from 0 to 10, 0 meaning no tremor at all and 10 meaning intolerable tremor. In all patients, propranolol was washed in again at the end of the study, according to a personalized schedule under supervision of neurologists specialized in movement disorders (M.A.J.T, K.L.L and A.F.R) in both centers. 


### Motor tasks during EMG-fMRI 
  
An fMRI scan was performed, while EMG was recorded simultaneously, off-medication. During scanning patients executed a motor task in which they were instructed to alternate periods of 30 s rest with periods of 30 s right hand and arm extension without supporting the hand and arm. The left arm and hand were relaxed which was verified by EMG. An additional task, in which the arm extension was combined with silent reading, was included in the same experiment. To maintain transparency of the results presented here, these blocks were not used for analysis in this study, but were analyzed for a different purpose ( ). Here, we analyzed 10 motor task blocks of 30 s that did not involve reading. Healthy controls mimicked a tremor during right arm extension by self-paced wrist flexion extension. Before scanning, participants were instructed and practiced the task outside the scanner. We asked the participants to raise their arm only slightly, because this was enough to evoke tremor when supine in the scanner. As large movements were also not possible due to limited space in the scanner bore, the disruption of the magnetic field due to movement was limited. All subjects received visual task instruction using slides during scanning. 


### EMG-fMRI acquisition 
  
Images were acquired on a Philips 3T MR scanner (UMCG: Intera, AMC: Intera and Achieva, Philips, Best, The Netherlands) with SENSE-32 channel (UMCG) and SENSE-16 channel (AMC) head coils. In both centers, T2*-weighted, 3D functional images were obtained using multislice echo planar imaging (EPI) with an echo time (TE) of 30 ms and a repetition time (TR) of 2000 ms. Per TR, 39 axial slices, with a field of view (FOV) of 224 mm, flip angle of 70° with a 64 × 64 matrix and isotropic voxel size of 3.5 × 3.5 × 3.5 mm were acquired. To provide anatomical information, additional T1-weighted 3D anatomical scans with an axial orientation and a matrix size of 256 × 256 mm were obtained (isotropic voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm). EMG was recorded simultaneously (BrainProducts GmbH, Munich, Germany (UMCG) and MicroMed, Italy (AMC)), with pairs of sintered silver/silver-chloride MR-compatible EMG electrodes were placed above five right arm muscles: extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), flexor carpi radialis (FCR), extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) and first dorsal interosseus (FDI). To verify that the left arm and hand were relaxed during the tasks, EMG was recorded from bipolar EMG channels with electrodes placed above three left arm muscles, as well: extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis and first dorsal interosseus. A ground electrode was placed on the left wrist joint. Further EMG recording procedures were similar to the methodology developed in our previous studies ( ,  ). 


### EMG-fMRI analysis 
  
EMG data were corrected for scanning artifacts using the MR correction algorithms incorporated in Brain Vision Analyzer (Imaging Artifact Reduction method ( ); UMCG data) and FARM (fMRI artifact reduction for motion ( ); AMC data). After correction, data was further analyzed in Matlab (Matlab R2007a, Mathworks, Natrick, USA) using custom-made scripts. For each segment of 2 s, corresponding to one scan, the frequency spectrum was calculated using the default fast Fourier transform in Matlab (FFT). The individual frequency at the dominant tremor peak (both for tremor and mimicked tremor) was determined for each patient and healthy control by visual inspection of the segments. Patients without a clear and regular tremor peak in the EMG during the task segments were excluded from further analysis. Due to scanner artifacts in the EMG that could not be removed sufficiently by EMG artifact correction, determination of a dominant tremor peak was not possible for these patients. Total spectral power in a 5 Hz symmetrical band around the individual (mimicked) tremor peak frequency was exported for each segment and each right arm EMG channel, resulting in five vectors of the length of the number of scans/segments. The vectors of the three EMG channels with the highest total power were averaged. This procedure resulted in an EMG power vector with one entry for every scan. Next, this vector was orthogonalized with respect to the motor task block vector using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, to subtract the information that is already present in the block vector ( ). The orthogonalized EMG vector (referred to as residual EMG or r-EMG vector) now provides a measure of additional EMG relative to the mean EMG value across the task block. It represents the variation in tremor intensity over time. Subsequently, the r-EMG vector was element-wise multiplied with the block vector to obtain a vector that only has nonzeroes for the r-EMG during the task blocks, and zeroes otherwise. Finally, this vector was convolved with the canonical HRF, scaled by its SD and used as a regressor in the fMRI design matrix in addition to the block regressor. See   for a representation of EMG characteristics for one patient. 

fMRI data were analyzed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL, London, UK;  ). Preprocessing consisted of standard realignment and coregistration steps. A group-specific anatomical template was created using DARTEL (diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra) for a more precise inter-subject alignment to take age-related changes in anatomy into account ( ). Individual functional data were normalized and smoothed using the DARTEL template and an 8-mm full-width half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. To reduce movement artifacts, the six movement parameters derived from realignment corrections were entered as covariates in each individual analysis. Inspection of the EMG was used to correct the block regressor for actual on- and offsets of the motor task. Each single-subject first-level model thus consisted of a (corrected) block regressor, a residual-EMG (r-EMG) regressor and the six movement regressors. We refer to the resulting activations as block-related activations and tremor related activations. 

In this manner, activations that are common across task blocks will be mostly explained by the block regressor, whereas activations due to variations in tremor intensity will be mostly explained by the rEMG regressor, thereby overcoming the problem in traditional designs used for investigating tremor, where block- and tremor-related activations are mixed. 

At second level, dummy variables were inserted in the model, coding for each scanner, to model the effect of the different scanners used in this study. Second level within-group comparisons for the task and r-EMG contrasts, and between-group comparisons for each individual contrast were made on whole brain level. Activations were considered significant at a threshold of p < 0.05 (FWE corrected) and an extent threshold (k) of 20 voxels. This whole brain analysis was only applied for the cerebral hemispheres while cerebellar activations were analyzed with a more specific method for infratentorial regions (see paragraph below). 

Given the tremor, it is plausible that the ET patients made more head movements than healthy controls when executing the motor task. To test this we used the scan-by-scan realignment parameters calculated during fMRI preprocessing. We calculated the total range of head motion for each translation direction (x, y and z) and each rotation direction (pitch, roll and yaw) separately, across each session per participant and compared groups. 

As we hypothesized cerebellar involvement in ET, we additionally performed an analysis focused on the cerebellum using the Spatially Unbiased Infratentorial Template (SUIT) toolbox ( ). This toolbox isolates the cerebellum and creates a mask. The individual T1 image of the cerebellum was normalized to the SUIT template using nonlinear deformations. The contrast images resulting from the first-level whole-brain analysis were masked with the created cerebellum mask, normalized into SUIT atlas space and smoothed with a Gaussian filter of 4-mm FWHM. Contrasts were thresholded at voxel level p < 0.001, uncorrected, applying a cluster size of 20 voxels. 



## Results 
  
### Subject characteristics and behavioral results 
  
A total of 40 ET patients were initially included in this study. Data of twenty-one ET patients and twenty-one age- and sex-matched healthy controls were analyzed. Reasons for exclusion of patients from further analysis were either too much head-movement during scanning (one patient), unidentifiable tremor peak during fMRI data collection (16 patients), failure of equipment during scanning (one patient) or incorrect normalization to the DARTEL template (one patient). Analyzed ET patients (12 males) had a mean age of 51.6 (SD 17.8) years and mean disease duration of 29.8 (SD 15) years. Healthy controls (14 males) had a mean age of 50.6 (SD 16.4) years. Age and sex did indeed not differ between the analyzed groups (p = 0.86 and p = 0.35, respectively). Patients had a mean TRS score of 25.7 (SD 10.8) and a mean VAS score of 6.2 (SD 2.1) off medication. Mean peak frequency during scanning was 7.5 Hz in patients and 5.1 Hz in healthy controls. See   for characteristics of patients and healthy controls. No left arm movement was seen in the EMG signal. Head movement during scanning did not differ between ET patients and healthy controls (see  ). 


### Block-related activations, cerebrum 
  
There was no significant effect of scanner on brain activation, i.e. the results were the same for the different scanners used in this study. 

#### Within-group results 
  
For ET patients, block-related activations (block regressor) were found in the left motor- and premotor cortex and in the supplementary motor area (SMA). Additional activations were found in the right supramarginal gyrus, frontal areas, primary somatosensory cortex, superior parietal cortex and right thalamus (T > 6.49, p < 0.05 FWE, k = 20, see  ). In healthy controls, we found block-related activations (block regressor) in the left motor cortex and bilateral premotor cortex and the SMA. In addition, activations were observed in the left supramarginal gyrus, the inferior parietal cortex and frontal regions (T > 6.95, p < 0.05 FWE k = 20, see  ). 


#### Between group comparisons 
  
No significant increased activations were detected in ET patients when compared with healthy controls. Healthy controls had increased activations in the left sensori-motor cortex compared to ET patients (both T > 5.34, p < 0.05 FWE, k = 20, see  ). 



### Tremor-related activations, cerebrum 
  
#### Within-group results 
  
For ET patients, tremor-related activations (r-EMG regressor) were detected in the left motor-, premotor and somatosensory cortex. Additional activations were found in the bilateral visual cortex, the middle part of the cingulate gyrus and the right motor cortex (T > 6.74, p < 0.05 FWE, k = 20, see  ). In healthy controls, no significant activations were seen in relation with mimicked tremor (T > 7.05, p < 0.05 FWE, k = 20). 


#### Between-group comparisons 
  
Compared to healthy controls, ET patients showed increased activations in the right motor cortex, middle part of the cingulate gyrus and the left somatosensory cortex (T > 5.45, p < 0.05 FWE, k = 20 see  ). The reverse contrast (healthy controls > ET patients) was not further investigated because we found no significant mimicked tremor-related activations in healthy controls. 



### Block-related activations, cerebellum (SUIT analysis) 
  
Block-related activations in the cerebellum of ET patients were found in the right lobule V, VI and VIIIa (T > 3.58, p < 0.001 uncorrected, see   and  A). Healthy controls showed a large cluster of block-related activations in the right lobules V, VI, VIIIa and b (T > 3.61, p < 0.001 uncorrected, see   and  C). ET patients had no increased activations compared to healthy controls in the cerebellum. Healthy controls showed increased activations in the right lobules V, and VI and in Vermis VI compared to ET patients (both T > 3.32, p < 0.001 uncorrected, see  ). 


### Tremor-related activations, cerebellum (SUIT analysis) 
  
Tremor-related activations in the cerebellum were found in left lobules V, VI, VIIb and IX, right lobules V, VI, VIIIa and b and in the brainstem (particularly the dorsomedial parts of the pons and midbrain) in ET patients (T > 3.58, p < 0.001 uncorrected, see   and  B). Healthy controls showed mimicked tremor-related activations in right cerebellar lobule V (T > 3.61, p < 0.001 uncorrected, see   and  D). Increased activations were detected in ET patients when compared with healthy controls in the midbrain, pons and cerebellar lobules V and VIIIb, all left-sided. Healthy controls showed increased activation compared to ET patients in the right crus II (T = 3.32, p < 0.001 uncorrected, see  ). 



## Discussion 
  
Using a combination of EMG and fMRI we identified specific, somatotopically explicable areas in the bilateral somatomotor regions of the cerebellum associated with tremor. The technique employed here has been used successfully before in a small sample of ET patients, in patients with cortical myoclonic tremor and in Parkinson's tremor ( ,  ,  ). By selecting patients with a clear diagnosis of ET, we aimed to identify brain areas correlating specifically with ET. To our knowledge this is the first controlled EMG-fMRI study investigating a large, more homogeneous group of ET patients. 

### Block-related brain activations 
  
The participants performed a unilateral (right) arm extension task and, not to our surprise, the classical motor network was activated in both patients and healthy controls. These motor network activations were stronger in healthy participants compared to patients, probably because the tremor simulating movement made by the healthy controls was deliberate and had an observed larger amplitude than the trembling in ET patients. The simulated tremor movements made by the healthy controls were also more constant than the involuntary tremor of the ET patients. The block-regressor therefore likely explained more of the (simulated) tremor-related activation – the part that is common across task blocks — in healthy controls than in ET patients, also probably leading to increased activations. 


### Tremor-related brain activations 
  
In ET patients, tremor-related activations were found bilaterally in the cerebellum: in left and right lobules VI and V, and additionally in right lobules VIIIa and b, and in the brainstem: in dorsomedial parts of the midbrain, bilaterally, and pons, left-dominant. These results expand on earlier findings that the bilateral cerebellum is involved in ET ( ,  ,  ). Indeed, with our EMG-fMRI approach, we discovered specific, well-defined areas within the cerebellum, thus adding detailed information to the more diffuse localizations that have previously been described. 

We identified two distinct tremor related activations in lobules V-VI and in lobule VIII of the right cerebellum, ipsilateral to the right hand and thus particularly implicated in left-hemisphere functions. This particular cerebellar location indeed accurately fits with a previous study on functional connectivity of the cerebral motor hand region which revealed somatomotor regions of the cerebellum ( ). In this previous study by   representation in the cerebellum was cross-lateralized and had a double representation, with a strong primary somatomotor representation in lobules V and VI, and a slightly weaker secondary representation in lobule VIIIb. However, in addition to the cerebellar activity ipsilateral to the tremulous hand, activations were also observed in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere at the same locations as in the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere. Activations were evident in the   left   somatomotor areas, lobules V and VI, and at a lower threshold we found activations in the   left   lobule VIII as well. Thus, we found increased activations in specific somatomotor areas of the   bilateral   cerebellum. The additionally observed increased brainstem activations in the dorsomedial parts of midbrain and pons may point at involvement of the reticular input nuclei of the cerebellum. This putative role of cerebellar input sources in the tremor-related functional changes generates new questions concerning possible underlying causes of pathology to be addressed in future studies. We like to point out, in this respect, that these activations were specifically   tremor  —rather than   movement   related, as the brain activation in these areas covaried with tremor intensity over time   independently   of movement task performance. 

In healthy controls activations covarying with simulated tremor intensity were found in the ipsilateral cerebellum, right lobule V. This corresponds to earlier findings in an EMG-fMRI study examining similar motor tasks in healthy participants ( ). So, in comparison with simulated tremor, ET patients show additional contralateral activations in the cerebellum. 

There are different theories about cerebellar abnormalities in ET. According to the oscillating network hypothesis, tremor is driven by several components in a tremor network, that all act as oscillators ( ). Within this cerebello-thalamocortical tremor circuit, the cerebellum may act as one of these oscillators. The GABA hypothesis states that ET is associated with GABAergic dysfunction within the cerebellum, as evidenced by increased 11C-flunazenil binding to GABA-receptors in the cerebellar cortex, increasing with tremor severity ( ,  ). This leads to a third, neurodegenerative hypothesis, that is based on signs of neurodegeneration such as Purkinje cell loss and torpedoes that have been reported particularly in the cerebellar cortex in ET ( ,  ), at the same locations as where GABAergic dysfunction is found. 

Our findings could fit in several ways in these hypotheses. We found hyperactivity in multiple parts of the bilateral cerebellum, which could be explained by either primary or secondary effects of ET. Hyperactivity may be primary as a result of neurodegeneration leading to cerebellar atrophy as found in a recent study ( ). We hypothesize that the affected cerebellar cells are deficient and disorganized, making them less efficient, and this inefficiency could induce increased activations. On the other hand, the cerebellar hyperactivity may be secondary because of compensation of another defect in the cerebello-thalamocortical tremor circuit. 

Bilateral activation in unilaterally challenged tremor may seem odd at first sight. Activation of the right cerebellum is congruent with the right hand and arm extension task and the activated motor cortex in the left hemisphere. Left cerebellar activation points at functional coherence with cortical regions of the right hemisphere, i.e., opposite to the executive motor cortex for right arm movement. In this respect, it is noteworthy that, at a lower threshold, we indeed found increased activations in the right cerebral cortex in ET patients compared to healthy participants. These activations were located in the anterior parietal and premotor cortex. Together, these areas are known to play a major role in sensorimotor transformations underlying task-related visuomotor control ( ) and the organization of stereotypic movement ( ). Increased coupling between   left   cerebellum and   right   parietal cortex was recently demonstrated by functional imaging investigating multisensory processing ( ), independently of right or left arm involvement. One might therefore speculate that ET patients encounter more difficulties in maintaining a steady raised-arm position, which is imaginable because of their tremor, and that the increased activations in the functionally coherent areas of left cerebellar and right anterior parietal and premotor cortex reflect increased higher-order somatosensory processing implicated in motor tuning during posture maintenance. 

Whether the activations we found are the cause and/or consequence of tremor cannot be distinguished on the basis of fMRI – which is an associative technique - alone. To make such a distinction, longitudinal studies or interfering techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation might be helpful, but even then, the highly plastic and flexible human brain may make it impossible to make this distinction. Yet, by using a method that focuses on the anatomy of the cerebellum, we were able to more precisely localize the parts in the bilateral cerebellum that are involved in ET. 


### Methodological considerations 
  
In this study, the use of propranolol was one of the inclusion criteria we applied to define a homogeneous group of ET patients. This is one of the many variables that can be chosen for patient selection. The advantage of choosing this variable is the future option to compare the current propranolol group with other ET patient groups using different medication. This is a first step at an attempt, as far as we know, to differentiate medication-based subtypes of ET. 

A common difficulty in fMRI research lies in selecting a suitable task for healthy controls that corresponds well with the patients' task. In this study, a mimicked tremor was used. Consequently, the two groups were actually performing a different task: we asked the tremor patients to maintain their right arm in a postured position, while the healthy controls had to deliberately move their hand. These tasks were chosen to allow optimal distinction of brain networks involved in involuntary tremor as opposed to compensation or afferent feedback by deliberate, mimicked tremor movements. The mimicked tremor movement overall had a slightly lower peak frequency and had a larger flexion–extension movement of the right wrist compared to the tremor in ET patients. The effect of this behavioral difference can be seen in the task-related activations: the healthy controls showed a more widespread and a higher activation signal in comparison with the ET patients. We would like to emphasize however, that for our design and analysis that focuses on identifying tremor-related activations, it is not important that the participants, patient or control, execute the task exactly in the same way, or that their (mimicked) tremor (amplitude or frequency) is the same. Our analysis takes variation in task execution, leading to tremor intensity variation, into account and actually even depends on it. If there would be absolutely no variation in tremor intensity, our r-EMG regressor would be zero and we would not find brain activations related to tremor intensity variability. 

Finally, one may wonder why we did not identify activations in the cerebellar nuclei, also hypothesized to be involved in ET generation ( ). Finding activations in small structures, such as the cerebellar nuclei, is a challenge. Spatial resolution and intersubject variation of its shape with functional specialization of subcompartments may play a role in the absence of activation of this cerebellar region with 3-T data acquisition. In addition, high iron content in the deep cerebellar nuclei decreases the blood oxygenation level dependent-signal making functional imaging a difficult matter, that requires not only higher MR field strength but also novel dentate normalization methods ( ). 



## Conclusions 
  
In the current study, we used EMG-fMRI to identify brain activations specifically associated with variations in tremor intensity in essential tremor patients. Including a more homogeneous patient group and adopting the EMG-fMRI technique for data collection and analysis probably allowed to now identify specific bilateral areas in the cerebellum involved in essential tremor: lobules V, VI and VIII.

# Abstract
 
 Background  : Previous neuroimaging studies have revealed that acupuncture modulates the default mode network (DMN) in healthy subjects and patients with certain disorder. However, few studies have been performed to investigate whether or not acupuncture might modulate the DMN in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Thereby, the aim of the present study was to assess alterations of the DMN induced by acupuncture stimulation in patients with first-episode, drug-naïve MDD. 

 Materials and Methods  : Twenty nine patients with first-episode, drug-naïve MDD and 29 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. All the healthy subjects underwent 6-min resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) scan. While patients underwent acupuncture stimulation for 20-min electro-acupuncture stimulation (EAS) at Baihui acupoint (GV20) and two 6-min R-fMRI scans before and after EAS. Based on the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PC/PCC) as the seed region, functional connectivity (FC) method was adopted to examine abnormal DMN in patients by comparing with healthy subjects and to evaluate the influence of EAS on intrinsic connectivity within the DMN in patients with MDD. 

 Results  : Compared to healthy subjects, MDD patients had abnormal DMN. Moreover, results showed that EAS at GV20 induced increased FC between the PC/PCC and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and decreased FC between the PC/PCC and left middle prefrontal cortex, left angualr gyrus and bilateral hippocampus/parahippocampus (HIPP/paraHIPP) in patients with MDD, which were the main brain regions showing significant differences between the patients and healthy subjects. 

 Conclusion  : Our findings provide imaging evidence to support that GV20-related acupuncture stimulation may modulate the DMN in patients with first-episode, drug-naïve MDD. This study may partly interpret the neural mechanisms of acupuncture at GV20 which is used to treat patients with MDD in clinical.

## Introduction 
  
As a debilitating psychiatric disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by depressed mood, anhedonia, irritability, difficulties in concentration, and abnormalities in appetite and sleep (Nestler et al.,  ). MDD has a negative effect on the quality life of patients and leads to a huge economic burden for patient’s family (Collins et al.,  ). MDD will become the second cause of burden of disease by 2030 (Mathers and Loncar,  ). Recent large-scale epidemiological surveys in China have shown that the prevalence of MDD patients is high to 6.1%, which causes many social problems (Phillips et al.,  ). Thus, it is necessary to pay more attention to understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of MDD and finding effectively therapeutic approaches. 

As one of the most commonly recognized resting-state networks, the default mode network (DMN) comprises the brain areas mainly including the middle prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus (PC), angular gyrus and inferior parietal cortex (IPC; Raichle et al.,  ; Greicius et al.,  ). The DMN plays an important role in self-referential activities, such as evaluating characteristics of external and internal cues, planning the future, and remembering the past (Raichle and Snyder,  ; Buckner et al.,  ). Recently, several studies have revealed dysfunctional DMN in MDD patients, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions were mainly located in the middle prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus, ACC and hippocampus (HIPP; Anand et al.,  ; Tahmasian et al.,  ; Jacobs et al.,  ; Khalsa et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Sankar et al.,  ). The aforementioned studies indicated that the DMN was one of the most mature network matched with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for studying mechanisms of MDD (Guo et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ) and suggested that abnormal DMN was associated with MDD. 

As one complementary and alternative therapy method, acupuncture may improve microcirculation, balance organ function, and adjust mental activities. Acupuncture thereby has been increasingly and widely accepted by western countries (Lee et al.,  ). Neuroimaging technologies have been used to investigating neural mechanisms of acupuncture, and it has been found that acupuncture stimulation may modulate the DMN in healthy subjects and patients with certain psychiatric disorders, such as stroke, migraine and Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Dhond et al.,  ; Fang et al.,  ; Hui et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). 

According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, Baihui acupoint (GV20) is located at the highest place of the head, and GV20 is a commonly acupoint used to relief of dizziness, headache and anxiety by acupuncture stimulation, which attributes to the effect of acupuncture at GV20 on modulating vascular, endocrine, immune and/or nervous systems (Satoh,  ). GV20 was indentified to be involved in the treatment of MDD (Sun et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ). This raised the questions: whether or not the DMN could be modulated by acupuncture stimulation at GV20 in MDD patients. If so, how acupuncture stimulation modulated intrinsic connectivity in the DMN. To our knowledge, limited neuroimaging studies focused on relationships between the acupuncture stimulation at GV20 and the DMN in MDD patients. 

In the present study, we tried to investigate whether or not acupuncture stimulation at GV20 could modulate the DMN in patients with first-episode, drug-naïve MDD using FC method. FC is known to describe relationships between the neuronal activation patterns of anatomically separated brain regions, showing the level of functional communication among regions (Van Den Heuvel and Pol,  ). FC is typically used in most resting-state fMRI studies and is suitable for exploring the DMN (Greicius et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ; Van Den Heuvel and Pol,  ; Sripada et al.,  ; Lehmann et al.,  ). Here, we hypothesized that the abnormal DMN in patients might be modulated by acupuncture, which might attribute to the characteristic of GV20.

### Ethics Statement 
  
All participants were informed about the whole experiment procedure and signed an informed consent. The current study was permitted by the Medicine Ethics Committee of First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Guangxi, China. All research procedures of the current study were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 


### Subjects 
  
Thirty patients with first-episode, drug-naïve MDD (21 females and 9 males) were recruited from out-patients or in-patients at Department of Internal Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Guangxi, China. All the patients were individually diagnosed by two trained psychiatrists using the structured clinical interview of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-fourth criteria (DSM-IV; First MB et al.,  ). And the inclusion criterion for patients were: (1) being first-episode, drug-naïve; (2) the ages between 18 and 45 years; (3) being right-handed; and (4) having episode experience of MDD with the score of at least 18 on 17-items Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17; Guo et al.,  ). The exclusion criterion for patients were: (1) having other disorders by DSM-IV criteria, such as schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, organic mental disorder , delusional mental disorder, psychotic features coordinated or uncoordinated with mood or bipolar disorder; (2) having history of head injury or neurological disorder and degenerative diseases, such as movement disorder and Parkinson’s disease; (3) having acutely suicidal or homicidal tendency; (4) having any MRI contraindications; (5) having acupuncture contraindications; and (6) being non-responders in acupuncture needling. 

Twenty nine healthy subjects (14 females and 15 males; mean age: 26.76 ± 1.72 years) were recruited in this study. All the healthy subjects were free of depression or other psychiatric or neurological illness, and had no history of head injury and alcohol or drugs abuse. Healthy subjects did not have any family history related to neurological or psychiatric illness in their first-degree relatives. 

In addition, it was required that all of the subjects were no smokers, current pregnancy or breast feeding. Meanwhile, each subject completed an identical assessment protocol, which including the HDRS-17, self-rating depression scale (SDS) and self rating anxiety scale (SAS; Guo et al.,  ). 


### Experiment Paradigm 
  
Each healthy subject underwent only a 6-min resting-state scan. While each patient underwent two 6-min resting-state scans before and after the acupuncture stimulation for 20-min electro-acupuncture stimulation (EAS) at GV20. In detail, this study focused on GV20, which was a point on the Governor Vessel and located on the vertex of the head (Satoh,  ; Figure  ). The non-repeated event-related (NRER) paradigm was applied in the study (Qin et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ). Twenty minutes (20-min) EAS at GV20 was operated by the same professional acupuncturist (1 Hz, 2 mA, continuous-wave, HuaTuo-brand, SDZ-V-type, Shanghai, China; Figure  ). EAS was performed by inserting the sterile stainless steel disposable needle (0.30 mm in diameter and 25 mm in length; Huatuo-brand, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China) into GV 20 at the depth of needling arranging from 1.0 cm to 1.5 cm. Another electrode was attached to the acupuncture needle which was shallowly inserted point 1.0 cm nearby GV20. During scanning, each patient was instructed to keep eyes closed, not to think about anything and to stay awake. At the end of scanning, each patient was required to recall acupuncture sensations as following: aching, soreness, numbness, fullness, sharp or dull pain, pressure, heaviness, warmth, coolness, tingling, itching, and any others. The intensity of each sensation was measured by using a 100-point visual analog scale (VAS; 0 = no sensation, 10–30 = mild, 40–60 = moderate, 70–80 = strong, 90 = severe and 100 = unbearable sensation), which was similarly determined by Hui et al. ( ,  ).

### MRI Data Acquisition 
  
Images were acquired using a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Magnetom Verio MRI System (Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany) at the Department of Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, Guangxi, China. To reduce head movement, each subject’s head was fixed by foam pads in a standard 8-channel birdcage head coil. Functional images were acquired with a single-shot gradient–recalled echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the parameters: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 2000/30 ms, Flip angle = 90°, field of view (FOV) = 240 mm×240 mm, matrix size = 64 × 64, slice thickness = 1 mm and slices = 31. High resolution T1-weighted images were then collected with a volumetric three-dimensional spoiled gradient recall sequence with the parameters: TR/TE = 1900/2.22ms, FOV = 250 mm×250 mm, matrix size: 250 × 250, flip angle = 9°, slice thickness = 1 mm and 176 slices). 


### Image Preprocessing 
  
Statistical parametric mapping software (SPM8)  and REST toolbox (REST 1.7)  were used to analyze functional images. The first 10 functional volumes were removed for stabilization of the initial signal. Then the remaining volumes were corrected by slice timing and then realigned to correct for head motion. Data with maximum displacement in any directions of larger than 2 mm or head rotation of larger than 2° were excluded from further analysis. The datasets were further spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template and resampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm  isotropic voxels. The normalized data were smoothed with a 4-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. Nuisance covariates were regressed out from our data, including the six head motion parameters, white matter signal and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal. As global signal regression may cause a negative shift in the distribution of correlations (Murphy et al.,  ; Saad et al.,  ,  ), global signal was not regressed in our study. The data were then detrended and bandpass filtered from 0.01 to 0.08 Hz to reduce the effect of low-frequency drifts and high-frequency noise. 


### Functional Connectivity Analysis 
  
To identify the DMN, the seed region was selected in the PC/PCC (Sheline et al.,  ). The mean blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) time course was extracted from a 6 mm sphere in the selected PC/PCC (MNI coordinates: −9, −60, 25) of each subject on different conditions, including one resting-state condition in healthy subjects and two resting-state conditions before and after EAS in patients. Pearson correlation coefficients were estimated between the mean time course of the seed region and the time course of all the other voxels within the whole brain based on different subjects and conditions, separately. Pearson correlation coefficients were then normalized to   z  -scores with Fisher’s   r  -to-  z   transformation to acquire the entire brain   z  -score map of each subject on each condition. 


### Statistical Analysis 
  
Demographic and clinical data were compared by using two-sample   t  -test and Chi-square test. The threshold level in all statistical analysis for significance criterion was determined at   p   < 0.05. Main acupuncture sensations were described with each sensation intensity and frequency in patients. 

To explore the DMN, one sample   t  -test was firstly used for FC maps from healthy subjects, patients and patients after EAS, respectively. Two sample   t  -test was then applied to examine different patterns of the DMN between patients and healthy subjects. Paired   t  -test was used to examine the modulated patterns of the DMN in patients before and after EAS. The contrast map was thresholded at a voxel-level threshold of 0.005 with a cluster-level threshold of 0.05 (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected). The age, gender, weight, SAS and SDS were deemed as covariates of no interest. 



## Results 
  
### Demographic and Clinical Results 
  
In our study, one patient was excluded from further data analysis because of incomplete EAS at GV20 during the experiment. There were no significant differences in terms of age, gender and weight between the patients and healthy subjects. Patients had higher scores in HDRS-17, SDS and SAS compared to healthy subjects (Table  ).

### Imaging Results 
  
The patterns of the DMN in both healthy subjects and patients are shown in Figure  . The DMN mainly consisted of the middle prefrontal cortex, ACC, medial temporal cortex (MTC), bilateral angular gyrus. Compared to healthy subjects, patients had significantly statistical increased FC between the PC/PCC and the right middle prefrontal cortex and bilateral angular gyrus, and decreased FC between the PC/PCC and bilateral ACC (Figure   and Table  ). When it came to acupuncture stimulation, EAS-related results showed decreased FC in the left middle prefrontal cortex, left angular gyrus and bilateral HIPP/paraHIPP with the PC/PCC, and increased FC in the bilateral ACC with the PC/PCC in patients (Figure   and Table  ).

## Discussion 
  
In line with the NRER-fMRI design paradigm, we investigated modulatory effect of EAS at GV20 on the intrinsic connectivity within the DMN in patients with first-episode drug-naïve MDD. We found: (1) compared to healthy subjects, patients had abnormal patterns of the DMN including the right middle prefrontal cortex, bilateral angular gyrus and ACC with the PC/PCC; (2) EAS at GV20 modulated the DMN in patients, related to the left middle prefrontal cortex, left angular gyrus, bilateral HIPP/paraHIPP and ACC. Our findings provided further imaging evidence to support the neural mechanisms of GV20 on modulating abnormal DMN in MDD patients. 

### Abnormal DMN in Patients 
  
Compared to healthy subjects, MDD patients had abnormally increased/decreased FC regions associated with the middle prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus and ACC in this study. Previous studies had found altered DMN in patient with depression (Greicius et al.,  ; Bluhm et al.,  ; Sheline et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ). Our findings were similar to the results from these previous studies. Prefrontal cortex is involved in integration of cognitive, emotional behaviors by uniting emotional biasing signals or markers into decision making processing (Gusnard et al.,  ; Simpson et al.,  ). As one important part of IPC, angular gyrus plays a critical role in biological substrates of language, thought, attention and spatial working memory (Niznikiewicz et al.,  ), and is also enrolled in many diverse different tasks, such as the perception of emotions and interpretation of sensory information (Müller et al.,  ; Passingham et al.,  ; Ruschel et al.,  ). Recently, dysregulation of the IPC was found in depression and schizophrenia (Müller et al.,  ). Angular gyrus exhibited a more abnormal FC in depression patients (Guo et al.,  ), and the parietal cortex systems showed hyperconnectivity with regions of the DMN in MDD patients (Kaiser et al.,  ). Thereby, increased FC of the prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus in our study might suggest that MDD patients could have dysfunctions of cognitive and emotional system. Meanwhile, our results showed significantly decreased FC in the ACC with the PC/PCC in patients. ACC is known to be one of the most important regions related to cognition, emotion and memory (Davis et al.,  ; Greicius et al.,  ; Lavin et al.,  ). Decreased connectivity of ACC with limbic regions was also found in patients with depression (Anand et al.,  ). Thereby, we further speculate that decreased FC in the ACC is likely involved in the pathological mechanisms of MDD. 


### Modulation on the DMN in Patients after EAS 
  
After 20-min EAS, the DMN patterns in patients were modulated. Results showed that the significantly decreased FC between the PC/PCC and the left middle prefrontal cortex, left angular gyrus and bilateral HIPP/paraHIPP in MDD patients after EAS at GV20. The present findings were similar to the ones from several previous studies, which reported that acupuncture stimulation induced signal attenuation in the middle prefrontal cortex, HIPP/paraHIPP and IPC (Wu et al.,  ; Yoo et al.,  ; Hui et al.,  ). HIPP/paraHIPP is implicated in cognitive-behavioral functions and emotional memory (LaBar and Cabeza,  ; Savitz and Drevets,  ). Impaired function of the HIPP/paraHIPP was found in MDD patients (Hamilton and Gotlib,  ). On the other hand, positive artificial intervention improved status for MDD patients due to excellent performance of angular gyrus (Shen et al.,  ). Therefore, the decreased FC between the PC/PCC and middle prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus and HIPP/paraHIPP in our study might indicate the positive effect of GV20-related acupuncture on eliminating formatted negative emotion and mediating memory related to depression. Our findings also showed that there were significantly increased FC in the ACC with the PC/PCC in patients after EAS. It had been reported that increased FC was found in ACC within the DMN in depression patients after artificial intervention, such as task stimulation and antidepressant treatment (Anand et al.,  ; Greicius et al.,  ; Zeng et al.,  ). Our findings could present that there might exist positive intervention effects on the ACC of MDD patients, which were attributed to acupuncture at GV20. 

There were some limitations of our study: (1) Our study aimed to investigate whether or not GV20-related acupuncture stimulation might modulate the DMN in MDD patients, but not to investigate the specificity of acupoint (GV20). So, there was not a sham acupoint as a control in our experiment paradigm. However, the acupuncture associated with both GV20 and sham acupoint was our another research target in the future; (2) There were not different gender distributions of the two groups. Although gender, as a nuisance covariate, was regressed out from our data, gender factor could still not fully eliminate. Gender differences should be investigated and the present findings should be retested in larger samples in the future; and (3) The present results showed a preliminary research about the immediate effect of EAS on the DMN in patients with MDD. Further studies were still needed to confirm whether or not there were the possibilities of improving treatment effect in patients by a long-term EAS at GV20. 



## Conclusion 
  
We used fMRI and FC method to investigate the modulation mechanisms of GV20-related EAS to the DMN in MDD patients. Results showed EAS induced altered FC in the DMN, including the middle prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus, ACC and HIPP/paraHIPP which were the main regions showing abnormalities between patients and healthy subjects. Our findings might provide imaging evidence to support that EAS at GV20 has intervention effect on the DMN in patients with first-episode, drug-naïve MDD.

# Abstract
 
Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are highly comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders; however, the neural mechanisms of this comorbidity are poorly understood. Previous research has demonstrated that children with DCD and ADHD have altered brain region communication, particularly within the motor network. The structure and function of the motor network in a typically developing brain exhibits hemispheric dominance. It is plausible that functional deficits observed in children with DCD and ADHD are associated with neurodevelopmental alterations in within- and between-hemisphere motor network functional connection strength that disrupt this hemispheric dominance. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine functional connections of the left and right primary and sensory motor (SM1) cortices in children with DCD, ADHD and DCD + ADHD, relative to typically developing children. Our findings revealed that children with DCD, ADHD and DCD + ADHD exhibit atypical within- and between-hemisphere functional connection strength between SM1 and regions of the basal ganglia, as well as the cerebellum. Our findings further support the assertion that development of atypical motor network connections represents common and distinct neural mechanisms underlying DCD and ADHD. In children with DCD and DCD + ADHD (but not ADHD), a significant correlation was observed between clinical assessment of motor function and the strength of functional connections between right SM1 and anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, and regions involved in visuospatial processing. This latter finding suggests that behavioral phenotypes associated with atypical motor network development differ between individuals with DCD and those with ADHD.

## Introduction 
  
Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood, affecting 5–6% of school-aged children ( ,  ). It is characterized by impairments in motor coordination that significantly interferes with activities of daily living, and also impacts academic productivity, prevocational and vocational activities, as well as leisure and play ( ,  ). The clinical presentation of DCD is diverse ( ,  ,  ,  ), and up to 50% of children with DCD also meet diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ( ,  ). ADHD occurs in approximately 5% of children ( ,  ) and is associated with age-inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity and/or impulsivity ( ). The etiology of the comorbidity of DCD and ADHD, however, is not well understood. 

Children with DCD often exhibit functional deficits in cross-modal integration (i.e., integration of information from different sensory modalities), specifically during tasks that demand visual feedback for motor control ( ), internal/forward modeling (e.g., movement planning), gait and postural control, visual perception and motor coordination ( ,  ). Deficits in cross-modal integration have also been observed in children with ADHD ( ). Studies of typical individuals and split-brain patients indicate that cross-modal integration requires successful communication between a number of brain regions, both within and between hemispheres ( ,  ,  ), especially as tasks become more complex ( ,  ,  ,  ). 

Neuroimaging studies support the contention that brain region communication is disrupted in children with DCD and ADHD. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have implicated the corpus callosum ( ,  ,  ), a structure responsible for inter-hemispheric communication, as well as the right forceps minor and the anterior corona radiate ( ) in these disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of children with DCD have demonstrated atypical activity within visuospatial regions during complex tracing tasks ( ,  ,  ). In children with ADHD, fMRI studies have noted reduced activity of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during right-hand (i.e., left-hemisphere) response inhibition when performing a Go/No-Go task ( ,  ,  ). Thus, it is important that the motor network exhibit appropriate within- and between-hemisphere connections. 

In the typically developing brain, the structure and function of motor regions actually differs between hemispheres. Structurally, right-handed individuals have a deeper left central sulcus than left-handed individuals ( ). The left motor cortex in right-handed individuals also has greater neuropil volume, reflecting the number of dendrites, axons and synapses ( ). A DTI study demonstrated that the left corticospinal tract in infants is more structurally developed than the right ( ). Functionally, an fMRI study of right-handed adults demonstrated that the left motor cortex exhibits greater activation with both ipsilateral and contralateral movements compared to the right motor cortex ( ). Whether these structural and functional differences are associated with disrupted within-hemisphere and/or between-hemisphere functional connections between cortical and subcortical regions of the motor network has not been established. Furthermore, this has not been explored in children with DCD and ADHD, and could represent an underlying mechanism for the functional deficits observed in these children. 

Using resting-state fMRI, our recent study observed reduced functional connectivity (i.e., reduced temporal synchrony between distinct brain regions and an indicator of functional connection strength) between left motor cortex and structures of the basal ganglia, including the caudate, putamen and globus pallidus in children with DCD, ADHD, and DCD + ADHD, compared to typically developing children ( ). It is plausible these disruptions of functional connectivity observed in our previous study could also be associated with alterations in how cortical and subcortical regions of the motor network are connected within and between hemispheres. Thus, in the present study, we reexamined the data from the right-handed individuals of our previous study in order to investigate the hypothesis that within- and between-hemisphere functional connections of the motor network are altered in children with DCD, ADHD, and DCD + ADHD, when compared to typically developing children. Furthermore, we hypothesized that ADHD and DCD children would exhibit similar alterations in within- and between-hemisphere connections to support the comorbidity of these disorders, as well as alterations specific to DCD alone. 


## Methods 
  
This study was conducted in accordance with the code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving human subjects. The institutional review board for the ethics of human research approved the study. Consent and verbal assent were obtained from parents and children, respectively, after study procedures were fully explained. 

### Participants and assessment 
  
As described in our previous study ( ), participants were recruited from local schools and through community advertisements in locations such as hospitals and physician's offices in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Children were classified as DCD if they met the following criteria, which are consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR diagnostic criteria: they scored below the 16th percentile on The Movement Assessment Battery for Children – Second Edition (MABC-2;  ) (Criterion A), were reported by their parents as exhibiting motor difficulties that interfered significantly with daily functioning (as indicated on the Developmental Coordination Questionnaire ( )) (Criterion B), did not evidence a visual impairment or other neurological/medical (e.g., epilepsy, cerebral plays, muscular dystrophy) condition that would affect movement and did not meet criteria for a diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorder (Criterion C) and did not display an intellectual impairment as evidenced by performance on a standardized measure of cognitive function (Criterion D). Scores greater than the 5th percentile and less than the 16th percentile on the MABC-2 are associated with mild to moderate motor impairment, whereas scores less than the 5th percentile are associated with severe motor impairment. Children were classified as ADHD if they met diagnostic criteria on the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-IV ( ) or had a   t  -score above the 95th percentile on the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised ( ) and were diagnosed by a physician as having ADHD based on DSM-IV criteria. Children meeting criteria for both DCD and ADHD were classified as DCD + ADHD. Children not meeting the criteria for DCD, ADHD or DCD + ADHD were assigned to the typically developing group. All children were required to be right handed. This assessment resulted in 19 ADHD alone children, 6 DCD alone children, 14 DCD + ADHD children and 21 typically developing children. These group sizes are less than our previous study, as we selected only right-handed children for the present analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics of each group are summarized in  . 

Exclusion criteria for all groups included a history of a diagnosed metabolic or genetic condition, epilepsy or other seizure disorder, cerebral palsy, psychiatric disorder other than ADHD, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, prematurity (born at < 36 weeks gestation), very low birth weight (< 1500 g), or severe traumatic brain injury. There were no group differences for age or IQ (see  ); however, the typically developing group had a significantly higher proportion of females compared to the other groups [χ(1,   N   = 60) = 13.1,   p   < 0.05]. Children on stimulant treatment for ADHD were asked to refrain from taking medication on the day of imaging. All children in the ADHD group, and all but one in the DCD + ADHD group were on stimulant medication. 

As there is no gold standard for identifying DCD, in addition to the MABC-2, all participants were assessed using a second measure of motor skills, the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND;  ). The MAND is a standardized measure of fine and gross motor skills in individuals from 3 years into adulthood. It includes 10 items. The raw scores on each item are converted to a scaled score with a mean of 10 and standard deviation (SD) of 3. A Neurodevelopmental Index score (NDI) with a mean of 100 (SD = 15) is derived from the sum of the scaled scores. The MAND has been found to have good test-retest reliability and to be a valid measure of motor function in children ( ,  ). NDI scores of each group are summarized in  . 


### Image acquisition and analysis 
  
Images were collected using a 3 Tesla GE MR scanner (Signa VH/i, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) with an eight-channel phased-array radiofrequency (RF) head coil. Resting-state fMRI consisted of five minutes of a T *-weighted gradient-recalled echo, echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, flip angle = 70°, matrix size 64 × 64, FOV = 220 mm × 220 mm, 4-mm slice thickness, 26 slices). Foam padding was fitted between the RF coil and the head at the temples and the forehead to restrict head movement. Participants were asked to look at a fixation cross at the center of a screen during imaging. T -weighted images were obtained for anatomical registration of the fMRI data (multi-slice fast spoiled gradient echo; TR/TE = 200/2.5 ms, flip angle = 18°, matrix size = 128 × 128, FOV = 220 mm × 220 mm, 4-mm slice thickness, 40 slices). 

Prior to statistical analysis, resting-state fMRI data underwent pre-processing using with the FMRIB Software Library (FSL,  ), which included scalp and skull removal using the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) ( ), motion correction using MCFLIRT ( ), interleaved slice timing correction, temporal high pass filtering (> 0.01 Hz), spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm, and registration to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard template with resampling to 2 × 2 × 2 mm . T -weighted images were segmented into grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid using FMRIB's Automated Segmentation Tool (FAST) ( ). All participants' data were examined for head motion, and data were excluded from analysis if head movement exceeded 2 mm. In addition, given the potential for head motion in the ADHD/DCD groups, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine if there were any differences in the degree of head motion between groups. 

Masks of left and right SM1 were manually drawn on each participant's anatomical images using the FSLView drawing tool, with the omega-shaped anatomical landmark of the motor cortex as a guide ( ). Masks were registered to the participant's native resting-state fMRI data space using FLIRT, and then reduced to a final volume of 100 contiguous voxels using the process of inter-voxel temporal cross-correlation, which identifies the region within the mask with the greatest homogeneity in terms of temporal synchrony ( ). Prior to analysis of data using this mask, the center of gravity of the anatomical location of the mask and the degree of cross-correlation within masks were each tested between subject groups using a Student's   t  -test. This analysis revealed there were no differences between groups; thus, there were no group biases in this method of mask generation. 

The average time series of the voxels in left SM1 was computed from the preprocessed resting-state data to act as the regressor of interest in a time-series analysis using the general linear model (GLM), as implemented in   FEAT v6.0   (FSL,  ). The average time series from white matter and CSF were used as nuisance regressors. The GLM analysis generated a map of the functional connectivity of left SM1 with the rest of the brain. This procedure was repeated using the average time series of the voxels in right SM1 to give a map of the functional connectivity of right SM1 with the rest of the brain. A mixed effects GLM analysis was then performed using all participants' left SM1 and right SM1 functional connectivity maps. Maps were created for each group to show: 1) the average connectivity of left SM1 and right SM1, as well as brain voxels that overlapped in these two maps, and 2) brain voxels that exhibited a significant difference in their connectivity with left SM1 and right SM1. These maps were computed as Z-statistic images and corrected for multiple comparisons based on a family-wise error rate to a significance level of   p   = 0.05, using   AlphaSim   of the AFNI analysis package ( ). Brain regions were anatomically identified by Brodmann's area and using the Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical structural atlases within   FSLView   ( ,  ). Because the proportion of males and females significantly differed between groups, we performed a preliminary image analysis, which revealed no group differences for sex. Thus, sex was not included as a factor in the main group analysis, which helped to maximize the available degrees of freedom. 


### Behavioural analysis 
  
NDI scores were compared between groups by ANOVA. For groups exhibiting a significant difference from typically developing children, NDI scores were entered into a correlation analysis with functional connectivity (left SM1 and right SM1, separately) on a pixel-by-pixel basis, to identify brain regions whose strength of functional connections with SM1 significantly varied with NDI score. 



## Results 
  
No datasets needed to be discarded due to excessive head motion during imaging. ANOVA revealed no statistical difference between groups in terms of maximum head motion (in mm) during imaging [  F  (3,56) = 1.47,   p   = 0.23], and thus all data sets were included in the analysis. 

Group functional connectivity maps for left SM1 and right SM1, as well as overlapping voxels, are shown in  . Significant functional connections with SM1 were observed for all groups and were consistent with those reported previously, including the contralateral and ipsilateral primary motor, somatosensory and premotor cortices, as well as the putamen, thalamus and cerebellum ( ,  ). As expected, there was considerable overlap of the left and right SM1 connectivity maps (shown in green in  ) for all groups. Visual inspection suggests there were differences between the DCD, ADHD, DCD + ADHD, and typically developing groups in the degree of this overlap. These differences were tested statistically on a voxel-by-voxel basis and corrected for multiple comparisons, as described above. 

Brain regions whose functional connectivity with left SM1 significantly differed from that with right SM1 are shown in   and are listed in   and  . For all groups, the left precentral and postcentral gryi and left posterior insula were more strongly connected with left SM1 than with right SM1, and the right precentral and postcentral gryi and right posterior insula were more strongly connected with right SM1 than with left SM1. In other words, the motor cortex of typically developing children possessed stronger within-hemisphere connections with other motor cortices and the posterior insula than between-hemisphere connections, and this was preserved in children with ADHD or DCD. 

In typically developing children, the right thalamus and left lobule V of the cerebellum were more strongly connected with right SM1 than with left SM1. This was not the case for children with ADHD or DCD. For these children, the left thalamus and right lobule V of the cerebellum were more strongly connected with left SM1 than with right SM1. Thus, the right motor cortex of typically developing children had stronger within-hemisphere connections with the thalamus and contralateral connections with the cerebellum. For children with ADHD or DCD, it is the left motor cortex that possessed these stronger connections. 

Our results also demonstrated altered functional connections specific to children with DCD. The right putamen was more strongly connected with right SM1 than left SM1 in typically developing children and children with ADHD. For children with DCD, however, the right putamen did not possess stronger within-hemisphere connections with motor cortex; the right putamen in these children was equally connected to right and left SM1. A summary highlighting the group differences in within- and between-hemisphere functional connections with SM1 is provided in  . 

Children with DCD + ADHD exhibited additional alterations in motor network connectivity, including stronger connections of bilateral precuneus, middle frontal gyri and inferior lateral occipital cortices with the left SM1 than with the right SM1. These regions were equally connected to left and right SM1 in typically developing children and children with only ADHD or DCD, 

ANOVA of NDI scores revealed a significant difference between groups [  F  (3,56) = 21.87,   p   < 0.001]. Follow-up Tukey HSD tests demonstrated that the typically developing group significantly differed from the DCD and DCD + ADHD groups [HSD > HSD(0.01) = 19.34,   p   < 0.01]; however, typically developing children did not differ significantly from children with ADHD [HSD < HSD(0.05) = 15.75,   p   > 0.05]. This is in agreement with a previous study ( ). Since the NDI scores for children with ADHD children were in the average range, it appears that the difference from typically developing children was predominantly due to DCD and not ADHD. Thus, the DCD and DCD + ADHD groups were combined in order to investigate the correlation between NDI scores and each of left and right SM1 connectivity in all children with DCD.   shows the results of this analysis. Connectivity with right SM1 was significantly correlated with NDI score in regions of the default mode network, including a positive correlation with the medial prefrontal cortex and a negative correlation with the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral angular gyri. No brain regions exhibited a significant correlation between NDI score and connectivity with left SM1. 


## Discussion 
  
Within- and between-hemisphere functional connections amongst cortical motor areas, subcortical motor areas and the cerebellum (e.g., cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway connections) are necessary to integrate sensory information from both sides of the body when coordinating, planning and executing movements. Our findings demonstrate that the functional connections between these regions are altered in children with DCD and ADHD, lending support to our hypothesis that within- and between-hemisphere motor functional connections are altered in children with DCD and ADHD, and that some of these are neural mechanisms common to ADHD and DCD and some are mechanisms specific to DCD. 

### Preserved motor connections in ADHD and DCD 
  
We observed stronger within-hemisphere connections of the posterior insula and SM1 in typically developing children and in children with ADHD and DCD, compared to between-hemisphere connections. This not been reported previously; however, one resting-state fMRI study has established significant connections between the posterior insula and SM1 ( ), supporting a role of the posterior insula in sensorimotor integration. Given that DCD is a sensory processing disorder, altered functional connections between the posterior insula and SM1 is a plausible mechanism for sensory processing deficits in DCD; however, our data suggest there is no alteration in the within- and between-hemisphere functional connections of the posterior insula with SM1. 


### Altered motor connections common to ADHD and DCD 
  
Lobules V and VI of the cerebellum are key regions in the coordination, planning and execution of movements ( ). The thalamus fulfills a similar role, amongst others. Our typically developing children exhibited stronger functional connections between right SM1 and the right thalamus and left cerebellar lobule V, relative to their connections with left SM1. Stronger within-hemisphere connections between right SMI and right thalamus relative to between-hemisphere connections and stronger contralateral connections between right SM1 and the cerebellum have not been reported previously, and the reason for their existence is unclear. One possibility is that it is necessary to mitigate the non-dominance of the left hand for tasks that require dexterity and coordination; however, further studies to investigate the relationship between these functional connections and left hand function are required to substantiate this postulation. 

Our results show that children with DCD and ADHD (including DCD + ADHD) exhibit a different pattern of within- and between-hemisphere connections of the thalamus and cerebellum, when compared to typically developing children: the left thalamus and the right lobule V of the cerebellum are more connected with left SM1 than with right SM1 in children with DCD and ADHD children (summarized in  ). Following the argument above regarding mitigation of the non-dominant hand in controls, it is plausible that stronger within-hemisphere connections of the left thalamus and stronger between-hemisphere connections of the right cerebellum may be an attempt to mitigate sensorimotor deficits of the dominant right hand in children with DCD and ADHD. Our findings also support a previous resting-state fMRI study of ADHD that demonstrated disruptions within frontal-striatal-cerebellar circuits ( ), as well other studies that observed alterations in cognitive and attention brain networks ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ); some of these studies suggest there is an interaction between these altered networks and changes within networks associated with motor and sensory functions ( ,  ). Our findings provide direct evidence of how the motor network is altered in DCD and ADHD, and serve to foster future studies of these interactions. 


### Altered motor connections in DCD, but preserved in ADHD 
  
We observed that the within-hemisphere connections between the right putamen and SM1 were stronger than the between-hemisphere connections, in typically developing children and in children with ADHD (both ADHD alone and in combination with DCD). These connections thus appear to be part of typical development and are not impacted in ADHD. As discussed above, it is possible that stronger connections in the right hemisphere between subcortical regions and the motor cortex may be associated with mitigation of the non-dominant hand. In DCD alone children, however, the between-hemisphere and within-hemisphere connections of the right putamen with SM1 were of equivalent strength (summarized in  ). This finding suggests that DCD children lack the hemispheric dominance of functional connections between the right putamen and the motor cortex, and hence constitutes a neural mechanism specific to DCD. The lack of hemispheric dominance of right putamen functional connections may help explain the bimanual coordination deficits observed in children with DCD. This alteration in functional connections could also be associated with the observation of reduced diffusivity within the corticospinal tract and posterior thalamic radiation in children with DCD relative to typically developing children ( ), which together may help explain the significant deficits observed across a wide range of motor functions, including implicit motor planning ( ). 


### Additional altered connections in DCD + ADHD 
  
In our children with DCD + ADHD, the precuneus, middle frontal gyri and inferior lateral occipital cortex all exhibited stronger functional connections with left SM1 than with right SM1. This could be the result of weakened functional connections of these areas to right SM1. These regions have vital roles in spatial orientation and other higher order visual and sensory functions. Thus, our findings suggest that alteration in functional connections associated with higher order sensory processing represent a mechanism underlying the comorbidity of ADHD and DCD. These altered connections could possibly explain the visuospatial problems that have been associated with these disorders, particularly DCD + ADHD ( ,  ). 


### Correlations between right SM1 connectivity and NDI scores in DCD children 
  
These latter points are supported by our observation of a significant correlation between NDI scores and connectivity of the right SM1 with regions of the default mode network associated with visuospatial processing (i.e., the angular gyri), which has been implicated in DCD ( ,  ,  ,  ). A significant difference in NDI scores between DCD (either alone or in combination with ADHD) and typically developing children, but not ADHD alone children, is in agreement with previous studies ( ). We, however, have extended this previous finding by demonstrating an underlying physiological mechanism for neurodevelopment severity in DCD (and DCD + ADHD) children in the form of altered functional connections of the motor network with visuospatial processing regions; this is highly clinically significant, and it also suggests that the behavioral phenotypes associated with atypical motor network development differ between individuals with DCD (alone or in combination with ADHD) and those with ADHD alone. 


### Limitations 
  
Although we had 20 children with DCD in our sample, only six had DCD alone. Thus, sample size of the DCD alone group is a major limitation. However, the consistency between the findings in our DCD alone group with those of the other groups increases the confidence in our results. In addition, NDI only differed between typically developing children and DCD (either alone or in combination with ADHD) and not ADHD alone. This allowed us to perform our correlational analysis of NDI score and functional connection strength with our original DCD group size of 20. Nevertheless, our findings could be further substantiated by increasing the size of the DCD group, as well as by employing concurrent structural markers to examine the integrity of white matter tracts along motor pathways. Furthermore, comprehensive behavioral evaluation of the functional deficits experienced by these children could help elucidate the specific motor pathways altered by different clinical features of DCD and ADHD. Due to the cross-sectional design of the current study, we are unable to examine the impact of brain maturation on connectivity; however, future longitudinal studies could address this issue. 

The children in the DCD group met only 3 of the 4 of the DSM-V criteria for the disorder. We did not specifically establish whether the motor coordination difficulties evidenced by the children in the DCD groups were present from an early age or of recent onset. However, children who evidenced history of traumatic brain injury or other neurological conditions, which could account for recent onset of the symptoms associated with DCD, were excluded from participation in this study. 

All children with ADHD, but one, were on stimulant medication. Therefore, medication status could potentially explain some of the differences we observed between ADHD and DCD children. However, the consistency of our findings across all patient groups as well as the apparent specificity of NDI score to children with DCD (either alone or in combination with ADHD) strongly suggests that medication status had little or no effect on our findings. 

In summary, our findings support the hypothesis that within- and between-hemisphere functional connections are altered in the motor networks of children with DCD and ADHD, some of which are associated with ADHD and DCD comorbidity, and others that are specific to DCD alone. Our results thus provide important clues as to the shared and distinct neural mechanisms that underlie these common neurodevelopmental disorders.

# Title

The Neural Responses to Social Cooperation in Gain and Loss Context

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
Cooperation is pervasive and constitutes the core behavioral principle of human social life. Previous studies have revealed that mutual cooperation was reliably correlated with two reward-related brain regions, the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study sought to investigate how the loss and gain contexts modulated the neural responses to mutual cooperation. Twenty-five female participants were scanned when they played a series of one-shot prisoner’s dilemma games in the loss and gain contexts. Specifically, participants and partners independently chose to either cooperate with each other or not, and each was awarded or deprived of (in the gain context or the loss context, respectively) a sum of money which depended upon the interaction of their choices. Behavioral results indicated that participants cooperated in nearly half of the experiment trials and reported higher level of positive emotions for mutual cooperation in both contexts, but they cooperated more in the gain than in the loss context. At the neural level, stronger activities in the orbitofrontal cortex were observed for mutual cooperation compared with the other three outcomes in both contexts, while stronger activation in ventral striatum associated with mutual cooperation was observed in the gain context only. Together, our data indicated that, even in the one-shot interaction under loss context, participants still exhibited preference for cooperation and the rewarding experience from a mutually cooperative social interaction activated the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex, but the loss context weakened the association between the ventral striatum activation and mutual cooperation.

## Introduction 
  
Traditional economic theories generally assume that people are absolutely self-interested. However, hundreds of recent experimental evidences have indicated that, in social interactions, people often showed concerns for interests of others and exhibited strong preferences for fairness and reciprocity, eventually leading to regular deviations from purely self-interested behaviors [ – ]. A good example is the pervasive cooperation among nonrelatives, which is an important base of human society, especially when the social division of labor is striding towards intensification and specialization. 

Cooperative behavior among nonrelatives has been widely explored in behavioral and neuroimaging studies using Prisoners’ Dilemma (PD) game. In this game, two players simultaneously decide whether or not to cooperate with each other and receive a payoff that depends upon the interaction of their respective choices. Mutual cooperation leads to a modest payoff to both players, while a lesser amount of payoff to both players would occur in case of mutual defection. Importantly, a player gets largest payoff when he defects and the partner cooperates, and the worst outcome is got when the player cooperates while the partner defects. According to traditional economic theories, for maximizing personal benefits, the player should always defect. However, abundant studies have found that players cooperated more than expected, with mutual cooperation occurring about 50% [ ]. Even when the interaction was anonymous and one-shot, which mean there were no monetary return and gain for reputation in the future, a considerable percentage of people still tend to cooperate [ ]. How did people resist the temptation of monetary rewards and choose to cooperate with nonrelatives in the PD game? To answer this question, a large number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have been conducted using the PD game or related trust games. It was revealed that mutual cooperation was reliably correlated with two reward-related brain regions, the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex [ – ]. Moreover, the degree of future cooperation could be predicted by the activation in the ventral striatum [ ,  ]. Therefore, based on these findings, some researchers speculated that cooperation, as a type of social reward represented in the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex, is inherently rewarding and has higher subjective value than monetary rewards gained from defection [ ]. 

However, previous neuroimaging studies were usually conducted with repeated PD game, which leaving open the possibility that activations in reward regions were the result of that participants anticipated getting more money from the cooperation partnership in the future. In addition, most of previous studies using the PD game were conducted in gain context, i.e. players were awarded a sum of money depended upon the interaction of their choices. But, in real world, there also exist many situations in which people had to share a certain amount of loss, such as the failure of co-investments. It remains unclear whether people still endow higher subjective value to mutual cooperation than monetary rewards gained from defection when the conflict between personal and others’ interests concentrates on negative outcomes. 

To shed light on these questions, in the present fMRI study, we adopted a variant of the one-shot PD game in which loss context was employed. Specifically, participants and partners independently chose to either cooperate with each other or not, and each was awarded or deprived of (in the gain context or the loss context, respectively) a sum of money that depended upon the interaction of their choices. Following a conventional approach to study context effect on decision making, participants in the current study were initially endowed with 100 RMB as basic payment and the losses incurred were subtracted from this initial endowment. In the version of the game we used here, it was played a single time with each other. Firstly, we aimed to explored whether mutual cooperation was still associated with activations of brain regions involved in reward processing in the one-shot and anonymous interaction, in which there were no long-term benefits being expected from a cooperation partnership. Secondly, we sought to investigate the mechanism underlying the modulation of responses to cooperation in the PD game by context (loss vs. gain). Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that, even in the one-shot and anonymous interaction, activations in brain region implicated reward processing (i.e. ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex) still existed for mutual cooperation, but the activation strength might be different between the gain and the loss context. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Twenty-five right-handed female volunteers from the university community with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in this experiment. For imaging data analyses, three participants were excluded from further statistical analysis because of lack of cooperated trials or defected trials in at least one condition. One of them did not cooperate at all. One of them did not give cooperation responses in the gain context and the last one did not give defection responses in the gain context. In addition, the other four participants had to be excluded due to excessive head movements, finally leaving 18 subjects for imaging data analyses [mean age = 21.04 ± 1.59 (SD) years]. None of the participants reported a significant abnormal neurological history. All the participants gave written informed consent before scanning and were paid according to outcomes from a random selection of 20% trials plus a 100 RMB bonus. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of East China Normal University. 


### Materials 
  
Eighty female face pictures with neutral expression were selected from the Chinese Facial Affective Picture System[ ] with consent for publication, and randomly allocated to 2 (context: loss vs. gain) × 2 (type of partner: cooperated vs. defected) conditions. The arousal and attractiveness of pictures were counterbalanced across different conditions. 


### Procedure 
  
Before scanning, participants were told the rules of the game and that they would play with 80 different strange female partners who are students from another university in Shanghai. They were also informed that, for practical reasons, not all 80 game partners could actually be present in the fMRI laboratory, but that partners’ choices had been collected before the experiment. In addition, participants were told that both she and the partner in each trial would be paid according to the interaction of their choices. They would be given a basic payment for their participation (100 RMB) plus or minus the amount of money obtained or lost from a random selection of 20% trials in the game. In reality, each subject was the only participant in the experiment, and putative partners’ choices were determined in advance, so that half of partners cooperated and the other half defected in each context. 

The participants then completed 80 trials in the scanner with 40 trials in each context ( ). Each trial began with a 1.5s presentation of the partner's face. During the next 8s epoch, participants chose to cooperate or defect by pressing one of two buttons on a button box, and their choices were showed in red. After that, the trial outcome was displayed for 6s. All the trials were presented in a random order. Each trial was jittered with inter-stimulus intervals from 2 to 5 s, during which a black fixation cross was presented. Two additional jittered blanks (750∼2000ms; 1500∼2500ms) were set between the presentation of the partner’s face and the decision phase and, between the wait phase and the outcome phase. 
   Experimental procedure.  
Participants were scanned while playing the game for 80 trials, 40 in each context. Participant’s choices (C or D) are listed atop columns and partner’s choices (C or D) are listed aside rows. Money amounts in bold are for participant. Amounts in parentheses are for partner. 
  
After scanning, participants were asked to rate their emotional reactions to four PD game outcomes (CC: player and partner both cooperated; CD: player cooperated and partner defected; DC: player defected and partner cooperated; DD: player and partner both defected) in each context. Nine point Likert scales were used to rate the following emotions/feelings: happiness, trust, anger, disappointment, shame, and guilt. 


### fMRI Image Acquisition and Analysis 
  
Scanning was carried out on a 3T Siemens scanner at the Functional MRI Lab (East China Normal University, Shanghai). For functional images, 36 slices were acquired using a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR = 2200 ms, TE = 30 ms, FOV = 220 mm, matrix size = 64 × 64, slice thickness = 3 mm, gap = 0.3 mm). Before the functional run, a high-resolution structural image was acquired using a T1-weighted, multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) sequence (TR = 1900 ms, TE = 3.42 ms, 192 slices, slice thickness = 1 mm, FOV = 256 mm, matrix size = 256 × 256). 

Data pre-processing and statistical analyses were performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London). The functional images were corrected for the delay in slice acquisition and were realigned to the first image to correct for interscan head movements. The individual T1-weighted, 3D structural image was co-registered to the mean EPI image generated after realignment. The co-registered structural image was then segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using a unified segmentation algorithm[ ].The functional images after slice timing and realignment procedures were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (resampled at 2 × 2 × 2 mm ) using the normalization parameters estimated during unified segmentation and then spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM). 

A general linear model (GLM) was defined for each participant that examined the neural response to the period in which outcome was revealed. More specially, at the first level, eight types of events were defined according to context (Loss vs. Gain) and the PD game outcome (CC, CD, DC, and DD). They were convolved using a canonical hemodynamic response function. All the encoding trials were modeled from the onset time of the outcomes (with zero duration). Additional regressors of no interest were created for partner presentation, decision and wait. Six regressors modeling movement-related variance and one modeling the overall mean were also employed in the design matrix. A general linear model analysis created eight contrast images for each participant summarizing differences of interest. The eight first level contrast images from each participant were then analyzed at the second level employing a random-effects model (flexible factorial design in SPM8). 

We performed region of interest (ROI) analyses on the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex which involved in reward processing. These two ROIs were defined as 10 mm-radius sphere centered on the activation peak for the contrast between mutual cooperation and the average of the other three PD game outcomes reported in Rilling et al.[ ,  ,  ], after converting from Talairach to MNI coordinates. Parameter estimates were extracted from each ROI for each of the eight experimental conditions from each participant using MarsBaR and then entered into ANOVA. 

This ROI analysis was supplemented with a whole brain analysis in which brain activities related to mutual cooperation were defined by contrasting the BOLD response to the CC outcome with the average response of the other three outcomes combined[ ,  ,  ]. Brain activations corresponding to gain relative to loss trials were identified by the (Gain—Loss) and reverse contrasts. Then, the context × cooperation interactions defined by (CC—Average of the other three outcomes) —(CC—Average of the other three outcomes)  were computed to explore how context affect cooperation. Areas of activations were identified as significant only if they passed the threshold of   p   < 0.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster-level with an underlying voxel-level of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected). 



## Results 
  
### Behavioral results 
  
First of all, we examined participants’ strategy during the task to make sure that their responses in the PD game were not just randomly decided. It turned out that participants did not adopt a Win-Stay/Lose-Shift strategy or Tit-for-Tat-like strategies. Instead, our data revealed participants’ decision were influenced by their own choices in the preceding trial. Specially, Paired-sample t test showed that participants cooperated more after defecting (  M   = 0.45) than cooperating (  M   = 0.35;   t  (24) = -3.47,   p   = 0.002) in the preceding trial. 

Paired-sample t test and χ  test revealed a greater cooperation rates when participants played the PD game in the gain context (  M   = 0.46,   SD   = 0.27) than in the loss context (  M   = 0.34,   SD   = 0.17) (  t  (24) = 3.27,   p =   0.003; χ  = 32.06, P < 0.001). 

A 2 (context: loss vs. gain) × 4 (outcome: CC, CD, DC, and DD) repeated measures ANOVA was carried out for each emotion rating ( ). Specially, for ratings of happiness, there were significant main effects of context (  F  (1,24) = 9.79,   p =   0.005) and outcome (  F  (3,72) = 67.23,   p <   0.001). Post hoc analyses showed that the level of happiness was higher for CC outcome than the other three outcomes (  ps <   0.001) and higher in the gain than the loss context (  p =   0.005). For ratings of trust, there were significant main effects of outcome (  F  (3,72) = 54.89,   p <   0.001), post hoc analyses showed that the level of trust was higher for CC outcome than the other three outcomes (  ps <   0.001). For ratings of anger and disappointment, there were significant main effects of context(anger:   F  (1,24) = 5.87,   p =   0.023; disappointment:   F  (1,24) = 5.07,   p =   0.034) and main effects of outcome (anger:   F  (3,72) = 74.14,   p <   0.001; disappointment:   F  (3,72) = 62.22,   p <   0.001), post hoc analyses showed that the level of anger and disappointment were higher for CD outcome than the other three outcomes (anger:   ps <   0.001; disappointment:   ps   < 0.001) and higher in the gain than the loss context (  p   = 0.023). For ratings of shame and guilt, there were significant main effects of outcome (shame:   F  (3,72) = 62.88,   p <   0.001; guilt:   F  (3,72) = 76.78,   p <   0.001), post hoc analyses showed that the level of shame and guilt were higher for DC outcome than the other three outcomes (shame:   ps <   0.001; guilt:   ps   < 0.001).

### fMRI results 
  
#### ROI analyses 
  
Parameter estimates across the ventral striatum (MNI 4, 18, 0) and the orbitofrontal cortex (MNI 3, 46, -12) reported in Rilling et al. [ ,  ] were extracted. For the ventral striatum, a 2 (context: loss vs. gain) × 4 (outcome: CC, CD, DC, and DD) repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant main effects of context (  F  (1,17) = 4.57,   p =   0.047) and outcome (  F  (3,51) = 4.85,   p =   0.005), indicating greater activities in the gain than in the loss context and increased activities for CC outcome than the other three. A significant interaction was also found (  F  (3,51) = 4.61,   p =   0.006). We further examined the effect of outcome within each context. Post hoc analysis showed that activities is greater for CC outcome than the other three in the gain context (  ps < 0  .  01  ), whereas there was no significant difference between outcomes in the loss context ( ). 
   ROI analysis of the parameter estimates of the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex for eight experimental conditions.    
For the orbitofrontal cortex, similar ANOVA was carried out. The result showed the main effect of outcome (  F  (3,51) = 6.40,   p =   0.001), Post hoc analyses indicated greater activities for CC outcome than the other three (  ps <   0.05). There was no significant main effect of context or context-by-outcome interaction ( ). 


#### Whole-brain analyses 
  
Compared with the other three outcomes, experiencing CC outcome activated left ventral striatum (MNI -6–8 22), left orbital frontal cortex (MNI -6 54–2), left anterior cingulate cortex (MNI -4 40–6), left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MNI -12 58 16), left lingual gyrus (MNI -18–86–10), right calcarine gyrus (MNI 16–92 4), and bilateral superior temporal gyrus (MNI -40–38 16 and 70–26 6). The reverse contrast showed greater activities in right lingual gyrus (MNI 10–78 0) and left inferior parietal lobule (MNI -26–54 52) ( ). 
   Regions Showing Main Effects of Outcome.        
Data analyses revealed that dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MNI -12 58 16) and cuneus (MNI 16–80 28) survived by contrasting gain trials with loss trials, whereas no region was activated in the reverse contrast ( ). 
   Regions Showing Main Effects of Context.        
Interaction between context and cooperation was computed by the (CC—Average of the other three outcomes) —(CC—Average of the other three outcomes) . Results showed that bilateral ventral striatum (MNI -4 18 0 and 14 26–2) and inferior temporal gyrus (MNI -38–28–14) were activated ( ;  ), whereas no region was activated in the reverse contrast.

     Regions Showing Outcome × Context Interactions.        
To further clarify whether there was a common neural mechanisms, we overlapped the simple effect of outcome in gain context (CC—Average of the other three outcomes)  with the simple effect of outcome in loss context (CC—Average of the other three outcomes) . The cluster located in the orbital frontal cortex overlapped between these two contrasts ( ). 




## Discussion 
  
We employed a modified version of the one-shot PD game to investigate how loss and gain context modulated brain responses to cooperation. Consistent with previous studies[ ,  ,  ,  ], even in this anonymous and one-shot PD game, participants still choose to cooperate in nearly half of the experiment trials, and they cooperated more in the gain than in the loss context. At the neural level, both the ROI and whole brain analysis revealed more activities in the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex for mutual cooperation relative to the other three outcomes. When focusing on modulation of cooperation response by context, we found that the ventral striatum only showed cooperation-specific activations in the gain context, but not in the loss context. And overlap analysis showed that cooperation-specific activations in the orbitofrontal cortex were not affected by context. 

Postscan emotion rating showed that mutual cooperation was the most personally satisfying outcome. Specifically, participants experienced high level positive emotions such as happiness and trust for CC outcome, while the most profitable DC outcome provoked negative feelings of shame and guilt. Previous studies using PD game had also revealed that the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex were activated more by mutual cooperation than by a same monetary reward in a nonsocial context[ ,  ]. Combined with the neuroimaging evidence linking the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex to processing the subjective value of fairness and cooperation[ ,  ,  ,  ,  ], our data suggest that increased activation levels in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex with the CC outcome may relate to the rewarding experience from a mutually cooperative social interaction. In addition, our results are also consistent with previous findings that reward-related neural activity was greater for positive reward prediction errors [ – ], or a discrepancy that an actual reward is superior to what is predicted. In the one-shot PD game, participants could never know for certain whether partner would cooperate or not, so the game outcomes were always of an unpredictable nature. Therefore, when participants chose to cooperate, compared with CD outcome, CC outcome involves a positive reward prediction error [ ,  ]. 

We further studied the impact of context on participants' behavioral and neural responses to cooperation. It was revealed that participants cooperated more and experienced higher level of happiness for cooperation in the gain context than in the loss context. Parallel with this, cooperation-specific activations in the ventral striatum only existed in the gain context. Our findings were consisted with the evidence from a recent functional neuroimaging study [ ], in which the authors employed a modified version of the Ultimatum Game to investigate how brain differentially responds to fairness in loss and gain contexts. They found the association between activation in ventral striatum and fairness was weakened in the loss context. Except of being involved in processing the subjective value of fairness and cooperation [ ,  ,  ], the ventral striatum is also known for its vital contribution to the cerebral representation of the primary reinforcement and monetary reward [ – ]. Therefore, under the shadow of monetary loss, the activation of ventral striatum might be weakened. 

However, the orbitofrontal cortex was also activated more for mutual cooperation relative to the other three outcomes, and this cooperation-specific activation was not affected by context. Previous studies have identified the significant role of the orbitofrontal cortex in mediating the mental pleasure related to the secondary reinforcement with social implications [ ,  ]. For example, a recent study[ ] revealed that processing moral beauty is related to activations in the cortical reward region of the orbitofrontal cortex, whereas facial beauty involved both cortical and subcortical reward regions (the orbitofrontal cortex and the putamen). Based on previous and our findings, we speculated that, compared with the ventral striatum, the orbitofrontal cortex might be more sensitive to social reward involving moral implication. Taken together, the activation of the orbitofrontal cortex observed in our experiment might be involved in processing purer social reward of cooperation which was immune to the impact of loss context. 

Dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and rostral anterior cingulate cortex activities were also found when identifying activations associated with mutual cooperation. Previous studies have revealed that the DMPFC was involved in the evaluation of self-referential stimuli and moral judgment [ – ]. The rACC with dense projections to orbitofrontal cortex and striatum is part of a wider network that mediates reinforcement and reward preference [ – ]. Thus, it is plausible that rACC activities in the present study might be related to the reinforcement of cooperation and DMPFC activities might be associated with moral evaluation of self. 

In conclusion, the current study further illustrated that the context of loss and gain modulate people’s behavioral and neural responses to social cooperation. Results showed that, at the behavioral level, the mutual cooperation was the most satisfying outcome for participants but they cooperated more in the gain context than the loss context. At the neural level, cooperation-specific activations in the ventral striatum only existed in the gain context, but activations in the orbitofrontal cortex were not affected by context. Together, our data indicated that, even in the one-shot interaction under loss context, participants still derive higher hedonic value from the mutual cooperation, but the loss context weakened the association between the ventral striatum activation and mutual cooperation. 

Future studies might further examine the context effect on neural responses to social cooperation from two aspects. Firstly, given some previous studies reported men and women behaved differently in the PD game, future researches might explore gender differences in neural responses to social cooperation in both contexts. Secondly, following conventional approach, participants were initially endowed with a sum of money as basic payment in the current study. Thus, the loss context in the current study was defined by a relative loss frame. Future studies might evaluate the context effect on neural responses to social cooperation with absolute loss context.

# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
Growing evidence documents the potential of machine learning for developing brain based diagnostic methods for major depressive disorder (MDD). As symptom severity may influence brain activity, we investigated whether the severity of MDD affected the accuracies of machine learned MDD-vs-Control diagnostic classifiers. 


## Methods 
  
Forty-five medication-free patients with DSM-IV defined MDD and 19 healthy controls participated in the study. Based on depression severity as determined by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), MDD patients were sorted into three groups: mild to moderate depression (HRSD 14–19), severe depression (HRSD 20–23), and very severe depression (HRSD ≥ 24). We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data during both resting-state and an emotional-face matching task. Patients in each of the three severity groups were compared against controls in separate analyses, using either the resting-state or task-based fMRI data. We use each of these six datasets with linear support vector machine (SVM) binary classifiers for identifying individuals as patients or controls. 


## Results 
  
The resting-state fMRI data showed statistically significant classification accuracy only for the   very severe depression   group (accuracy 66%, p = 0.012 corrected), while   mild to moderate   (accuracy 58%, p = 1.0 corrected) and   severe depression   (accuracy 52%, p = 1.0 corrected) were only at chance. With task-based fMRI data, the automated classifier performed at chance in all three severity groups. 


## Conclusions 
  
Binary linear SVM classifiers achieved significant classification of very severe depression with resting-state fMRI, but the contribution of brain measurements may have limited potential in differentiating patients with less severe depression from healthy controls. 

   Highlights  
  
SVM binary classifiers achieved significant classification of very severe depression with resting state fMRI data. 
  
Prefrontal, anterior cingulate and insula were the most discriminative brain regions. 
  
No significant classification could be achieved for less severe MDD with resting state data. 
  
With emotional task data, SVM classifier performed at chance for all MDD severity groups.

## Introduction 
  
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex brain disorder associated with dysregulation of distributed neuronal networks involving several cortical and limbic regions. This position is based on evidence from the neuroimaging literature that has documented distinct structural and functional alterations in patients with MDD compared to healthy controls ( ,  ,  ). However, these group-level inferences have had minimal impact on clinical translation at the individual patient level – that is, they do not directly lead to a way to determine whether a specific subject has MDD or not. Recently, machine learning techniques have been applied to neuroimaging data to draw inferences for individual subjects, with the potential for improving patient-specific clinical diagnostic and treatment decisions ( ,  ). Current diagnosis of mental disorders is based on diagnostic criteria drawn from self-reported clinical symptoms without any objective biomarkers. This has led to the search, in recent years, for a diagnostic system that can use objective measurements from a subject's brain to validate and improve the accuracy of psychiatric diagnosis. 

In the last decade, several neuroimaging studies have examined the classification accuracy of machine learned classifiers in differentiating patients with MDD from healthy controls. One major focus has been the application of machine learning techniques to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, including both structural and function MRI (fMRI) data. Machine learning is a sub-area of artificial intelligence that applies statistical methods to training data, such as high dimensional neuroimaging data, to find patterns that can distinguish patients from healthy controls. Authors reported classification accuracy for MDD ranging from 67 to 90% using structural MRI data ( ,  ,  ), 94% using resting-state fMRI data ( ,  ), 67–86% using task-related fMRI data ( ,  ,  ) and 76.3% using combined structural and functional MRI data ( ). High accuracy prediction is clinically important, as MDD is heterogeneous in symptom profile and prone to clinician bias with poor inter-rater reliability ( ). The identification of MDD subtypes based on neural abnormalities or brain imaging methods might improve classification accuracy, facilitate new drug discovery and move toward stratified medicine. 

Depression subtypes defined by symptom severity have several clinical implications for the treatment and prognosis. For example, baseline symptom severity is associated with drug-placebo differences in randomized control trials ( ) and antidepressants are recommended as the choice of treatment for severe depression whereas psychosocial interventions as the choice of treatment for mild-moderate subthreshold depression (NICE guidelines CG90, 2009). Additionally, epidemiological studies have shown the association of symptom severity with functional impairment, co-morbidity and increased risk of mortality ( ,  ,  ). In machine learning approaches, severity-related brain abnormalities have been shown to offer good discriminating potential in the classification of MDD and healthy controls. In emotional task fMRI data,   found significant correlations between the distance of participants' feature vectors from the separating hyperplane of a trained support vector machine, and those participants' severity scores from the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) ( ), which suggests a relationship between depression severity and test predictions ( ). Similarly, another study using structural MRI data reported a strong relationship between the fitted SVM weights and ratings of illness severity ( ). These findings suggest that fitted machine learned classifiers may capture patterns of brain abnormality in functional and structural neuroimaging data related to MDD severity. A model derived from a machine learned classifier may constitute an objective biomarker for depression severity. To date, no previous study has examined how the performance of machine learning algorithms in differentiating MDD vs. health may differ as a function of MDD symptom severity. This research question has important clinical implications in the context of whether machine learning approaches using fMRI data can yield comparable accuracy in the classification of MDD at various levels of severity. 

We examined the accuracy of two-class machine learning classification of three distinct groups of MDD patients, with different levels of symptom severity based on the HRSD Scores, versus healthy controls. The three groups of MDD with severity gradation were: mild to moderate depression (HRSD score 14–19), severe depression (HRSD 20–23), and very severe depression (HRSD ≥ 24). (While there is no consensus on cutoff scores on the HRSD for identifying MDD severity subtypes, these severity ranges are consistent with several published recommendations ( ,  ,  )). We expected that the classifiers would achieve higher accuracy for the patient groups with very severe depression compared to those with severe depression or mild-moderate depression. For each range of severity, we also considered two types of fMRI data – from either resting-state or from an emotional-face matching task – hence, we examined classifier performance for 3 × 2 different situations. 


## Materials & methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Ethics approval was obtained from the local review board. All participants were fluent in English and gave informed, written consent to participate in the study. Forty-five patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD ( ) according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis 1 Disorders ( ), were recruited through advertisements. (See   for participant demographics). Patients included 29 females and 16 males, all right-handed, in the age range of 19–58 years (mean 37 ± 11 SD). The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory was used to assess handedness ( ). The severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms was assessed using the clinician-administered, 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( ), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) ( ), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) ( ). Patients were also rated for disease severity using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale ( ), which allows clinicians to provide a severity rating based on their clinical experience. Patients were included in the study if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) acute episode of MDD of unipolar subtype and a score of 14 or higher on the HRSD, and (2) free of psychotropic medication for a minimum of three weeks at time of recruitment. Exclusion criteria were: (1) Axis I disorders such as bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, or psychosis, (2) history of substance abuse within six months of study participation, (3) borderline personality disorder, (4) medical or neurological disorders, (5) severe suicidal symptoms, (6) failure to respond to three trials of antidepressant medication, or (7) contraindications for MRI (metal implants, pregnancy, etc.). Patients were divided into three MDD severity groups based their HRSD scores. The mild-moderate group (HRSD 14–19) included 12 patients. The severe group (HRSD 20–23) included 18 patients. The very severe group (HRSD 24 +) included 15 patients. 

Nineteen healthy controls, matched for gender (11 females, 8 males) and age (20–52 years, mean 33 +/ 10 SD), were also recruited for the study through advertisements. These participants were screened using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM–IV Axis I Disorders, non-patient version, to ensure they did not have previous or current Axis I psychiatric disorders ( ) nor any family history of Axis I disorders, as determined by self-report. The control's HRSD scores ranged from 0 to 7. The demographics of the MDD patients and healthy controls are summarized in  . 


### MRI data acquisition 
  
MR images were collected using a 3 Tesla General Electric MR scanner (Signa VHi; General Electric Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) equipped with an eight-channel, phased-array head coil. For each participant, two resting-state fMRI scans of 220 s in duration were acquired using a single-shot gradient-recalled echo, echo planar imaging sequence (110 volumes, repeat time (TR) 2000 ms, echo time (TE) 30 ms, flip angle 65°, field of view (FOV) 240 × 240 mm squared, matrix size 64 × 64, in-plane resolution 3.75 mm, 30 axial slices, 4 mm slice thickness). For the resting-state collection, participants were required to remain in the MRI scanner with their eyes open and fixated on a black crosshair at the center of a projection screen. The participants were instructed to relax, not think about anything in particular, and not to fall asleep. In addition, four emotional face task fMRI scans were collected per scanning session (for each subject), lasting 300 s each (150 volumes, TR 2000 ms, TE 30 ms, flip angle 65°, FOV 240 × 240 mm squared, matrix size 64 × 64, in-plane resolution 3.75 mm, 30 axial slices, slice thickness 4 mm). A T1-weighted structural MRI (TR 9.2 ms, TE minimum, flip angle 20°, FOV 256 × 256 mm squared, matrix size 512 × 512, in-plane resolution 0.5 mm, 176 sagittal slices, slice thickness 1 mm) was also acquired for anatomical registration of the fMRI data. 


### fMRI emotional-face matching task paradigm 
  
While undergoing fMRI brain imaging, participants viewed triads either of faces or of control geometrical designs during a series of trials ( ). Each face had one of four emotional expressions: angry, fearful, happy, or sad. For each face triad, participants used a button box to indicate which of two target faces depicted the same emotion as the source face. Similarly, for control condition, participants responded with button press to indicate which of two geometrical designs matched with source geometrical design. Each fMRI run included 60 trials (12 for each of the four assessed emotions and the control condition). The order of presentation was randomized and each individual trial lasted 5 s (images: 3 s; inter-trial interval: 2 s). Stimulus onset asynchrony between successive trials was jittered (5 s or more in random increments of 0.5 s) to preserve fMRI signal variance ( ). Previous work has shown that this emotional face matching task compared to control condition engages affective processing mechanisms, and reliably activates the amygdala and other relevant prefrontal and cingulate regions ( ). 


### Pre-processing 
  
We considered two fMRI datasets, each involving all of the subjects, both control and MDD: one for resting-state, and another for the emotional face task. Each dataset was preprocessed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) and in-house code written in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The preprocessing steps for fMRI data included: (1) 6 parameter rigid body motion correction of fMRI volumes in SPM8, (2) non-linear spatial warping to MNI EPI template at 4 × 4 × 4 mm cubed resolution (43 × 51 × 37 voxels grid) in SPM8, and (3) 8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian spatial smoothing of fMRI volumes in SPM8. The pre-processed registered fMRI data were masked to exclude voxels outside the brain using a hand-built mask. This mask retained 26,904 voxels (1,513,406 mm ) out of the 81,141 voxels in the interpolated fMRI volume space. 


### Dataset notation 
  
To facilitate description of our analysis, we define a simple notation. We performed six analyses, using resting-state fMRI data or emotional face task fMRI data from one of the three patient severity groups (mild-moderate MDD, severe MDD, and very-severe MDD) as well as controls. We will use the phrase “dataset S” to refer to the dataset used in a given analysis. Therefore, dataset S consisted of either resting-state or emotional face task fMRI data from the patients in a given severity group as well as controls. 


### Overview of machine learning approach 
  
We ran six analyses, each testing the ability of machine learning to produce classifiers that could effectively differentiate between healthy controls and MDD patients from one of the three MDD severity groups, using either resting-state fMRI or emotional face task fMRI data. For each, we ran the LearnFMRI process, which selected one out of five different feature extraction algorithms as well as the regularization parameter value for the linear SVM learning algorithm (all described below). LearnFMRI then ran this particular choice of algorithm and regularization parameter value on all of the training data to produce a classifier, which could then be used to diagnose a future subject; see  . 

We now provide a detailed explanation of the LearnFMRI procedure. To reduce the dimensionality of the fMRI data, our LearnFMRI system selects one of five different feature extraction algorithms for each of the 6 datasets S (each hand-coded in MATLAB): (1) independent components analysis (ICA) whole brain map feature extraction, ICA-Whole-FE; (2) ICA significant cluster feature extraction, ICA-Clust-FE; (3) pair-wise correlation feature extraction, PairCor-FE; (4) general linear model (GLM) analysis whole brain map feature extraction, GLM-Whole-FE; and (5) GLM significant cluster feature extraction, GLM-Clust-FE. (LearnFMRI considered only ICA-Whole-FE, ICA-Clust-FE and PairCor-FE for resting-state fMRI data, and all five for task-based datasets.) Feature extraction algorithms ICA-Clust-FE and GLM-Clust-FE used statistical testing between patients and controls to extract features (voxel clusters) that were significantly different between the groups. To reduce the potential for overfitting, it performed statistical comparisons only between patients and controls in training sets (see   section below). Therefore, different sets of participants (i.e. only the training set participants) contributed to these statistical tests in different folds of the nested cross-validation described below. Statistical maps differed between folds. These differences are illustrated in  . The ICA-Whole-FE, PairCor-FE and GLM-Whole-FE algorithms did not use statistical testing between patients and controls to generate features. Details of feature extraction algorithms are provided below. 

For each task, LearnFMRI also tested the linear support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm with regularization parameter values 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10.0 and selected the best-performing parameter value. 

Testing multiple combinations of feature extraction and classifier algorithms on the test data and then presenting only the algorithms that perform best on that data may create a substantial danger of   overfitting  , where an algorithm works well because it is matching the specific pattern of noise that happens to be present in the dataset tested. This good performance does not generalize to new data with different noise patterns. (Note that this overfitting is in terms of the   choice   of algorithm; this is still a problem even when cross-validation is used to protect against overfitting in terms of the algorithms' learned weight values.) LearnFMRI therefore used internal cross-validation to protect against overfitting with respect to (1) the choice of feature extraction algorithm, (2) the extracted features (feature extraction used the patient/control labels), (3) the choice of regularization parameter value for the linear SVM learning algorithm and (4) the weights chosen by the linear SVM learning algorithm. 

Our LearnFMRI system is summarized in  . Given the set of labeled training data for each dataset S, LearnFMRI considers each combination of feature extractor and regularization parameter and returns the best-performing choice of feature extraction algorithm as well as a linear SVM classifier trained using the best regularization parameter value. To estimate the generalization performance of the chosen feature extraction algorithm and trained linear SVM classifier, we used a five-fold cross-validation process, repeated ten times, with different random partitioning of participants into the five folds. Note that different cross-validation folds found different best combinations of feature extraction/regularization parameter. This cross-validation process estimates the accuracy not of a single machine learned classifier but of the entire process of selecting the feature extraction algorithm and regularization parameter value and training the linear SVM classifier. 


### Feature extraction preliminaries – cluster growing algorithm 
  
The ICA-Clust-FE and GLM-Clust-FE feature extraction algorithms each identify significant clusters in statistical parametric maps (details provided below). Each uses the following automated region-growing algorithm to identify clusters: Given a 3D statistical parametric map, (t-map generated by comparing patients vs. controls in terms of ICA maps values or GLM beta weight values), the cluster-growing algorithm grows a cluster around each positive or negative statistical peak (local extremum) in the map. Specifically, it uses each peak voxel as a seed of the cluster, and then adds neighboring, statistically significant voxels to the growing cluster one-at-a-time, until the algorithm encounters either non-significant neighbor voxels or significant voxels that have already been added to another growing cluster. If two statistical peaks are too close together (within 10 mm of each other), the less-significant peak is not used as a cluster seed. This prevents large “hills” of significant voxels that happen to have two or more peaks that are close together from being divided into multiple smaller clusters. 


### Independent components analysis (ICA) feature extraction – ICA-Whole-FE, ICA-Clust-FE 
  
Our ICA feature extraction algorithms, ICA-Whole-FE and ICA-Clust-FE, are both based on the ICA procedure of  . Briefly, 15 ICA “connectivity maps” are computed. ICA-Whole-FE simply combines a given participant's ICA map values into one long feature vector for that participant. ICA-Clust-FE extracts significant voxel clusters by comparing patients vs. controls for each of the 15 ICA maps. Note that ICA-Whole-FE does not use the participant labels (patient or control), whereas ICA-Clust-FE does use the labels. We applied ICA-Whole-FE or ICA-Clust-FE to resting-state or task-based fMRI data separately. Details of the algorithms are provided in Appendix A. 


### Pair-wise correlation feature extraction – PairCor-FE 
  
The Harvard-Oxford atlas includes 26 prefrontal regions involved in executive control and/or emotion regulation (see  ); Previous literature suggest that changes in these regions have been associated with major depressive disorder ( ). PairCor-FE defined each participant's feature vector as the 325 pair-wise correlations among those regions' time courses, and al computed these correlation features separately for either the resting-state or task-based fMRI data, as follows. All fMRI data runs for the participant were concatenated along the time axis (two runs for resting-state data, four runs for task-based data). The mean fMRI activation time course was computed for each region (mean across voxels in the region). The Pearson correlation coefficient was computed for each pair of time courses among all 325 pairs of different regions; this 325-tuple of correlation values was the feature vector for the participant, which were used by the classifier; see the   section below. 


### GLM analysis feature extraction for task-based data – GLM-Whole-FE, GLM-Clust-FE 
  
The GLM-Whole-FE and GLM-Clust-FE feature extraction algorithms were used with emotional-face task fMRI data only. Both involve the standard General Linear Model (GLM) analysis, based on the following statistical contrasts:   
localizer contrast (sum of all five trial types), 
  
emotional faces - geometric stimuli, 
  
positive - negative emotional faces (happy - other emotional faces), and 
  
negative faces - geometric stimuli (where negative faces included angry, fearful, and sad faces). 
  

GLM-Whole-FE combines the four (first-level) contrast maps for a given participant into one long feature vector for that participant. GLM-Clust-FE compares contrast maps in terms of patients vs. controls and extracts significant clusters for each map. See Appendix B for details. 


### Base-learner: linear SVM 
  
Our LearnFMRI learning algorithm uses the linear support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm to create trained linear SVM classifiers. We used the LIBSVM implementation of the linear SVM learning algorithm and classifier, along with in-house MATLAB code for all data manipulation, cross-validation book-keeping, and accuracy computations. 


### Machine learning algorithm – LearnFMRI 
  
Given a labeled training dataset, LearnFMRI will produce a classifier that can accurately classify novel participants. As shown in  , LearnFMRI first selects one feature extraction algorithm (which is one of ICA-Whole-FE, ICA-Clust-FE, PairCor-FE, GLM-Whole-FE or GLM-Clust-FE) as well as the linear SVM regularization parameter   C   ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10.0}. LearnFMRI uses an internal cross-validation to find the appropriate feature selection and regularization parameter; see  . This involves trying each specific feature selector and regularization parameter on a portion of the training data and evaluating the performance on the remaining subset. (This is repeated four times; see “Illustration” section below.) After finding the best choice of feature selector and regularization parameter, LearnFMRI then uses these “settings” to train the classifier, using all of the training data. It then returns that resulting trained classifier. 


### Classifier performance 
  
For each dataset S, our goal is a single classifier (SVM*) that can accurately diagnose novel participants – that is, participants who were not in the training set. To estimate the expected out-of-sample (generalization) accuracy of this classifier SVM* – the result of running LearnFMRI on all of the training data from a given dataset S – we used five-fold cross-validation; see  . For each of the five folds, approximately one fifth of the participants was held out as a test set, with the remaining four-fifths comprising the training set. Test and training sets were balanced as closely as possible for proportions of patients versus controls. Five-fold cross-validation was repeated ten times with different random assignments of participants to the five folds. Note that this cross-validation ran the entire LearnFMRI learning algorithm for each fold, which in turn used internal cross-validation steps inside it – i.e. nested cross-validation inside the outer five-fold cross validation. The use of nested cross-validation was important for protecting against overfitting in the selection of the feature extraction algorithm, cluster selection from statistical testing (patients vs. controls), and choice of regularization parameter for the linear SVM base-learner. 

We quantified the performance of these classifiers using multiple measures: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (all measures were based on cross-validation). As described above, there were six analyses: mild-moderate MDD (respectively, severe MDD or very severe MDD) patients vs. controls, using either resting-state or task-based fMRI data. For each of these analyses, each of the participants used in that analysis was present in the (outer) test set in precisely one iteration of outer cross-validation, on each of the ten repetitions (see above). Thus, each participant's data underwent ten classification attempts. For each participant, we computed the proportion of correct classification attempts. Accuracy was computed as the mean proportion of correct classification attempts across all participants. Sensitivity was computed as the mean proportion of correct classification attempts for patients (true positives), and specificity was computed as the mean proportion of correct classification attempts for controls (true negatives). Balanced accuracy was computed as the mean of sensitivity and specificity. Positive predictive value (and negative predictive value, respectively) was computed as the proportion correct among positive (respectively, negative) predictions. 

For each of the six analyses, mean accuracy values were compared against chance accuracy using one-tailed bootstrap statistical tests on participants' proportion of correct classification attempts values. Chance accuracy was derived from randomly guessing the participant class (patient/control) weighted by the relative proportions of patients and controls in the given analysis. Specifically, let r = proportion of patients = #patients / (#patients + #controls), which is in the range [0,1]. Then random accuracy = r  + (1 − r) , which is in the range [0,1]. Chance accuracy values ranged from 50 to 53% depending on the numbers of patients and controls used in each analysis. The alpha-value (false positive rate under the null hypothesis of chance accuracy) was set a 0.05. Multiple comparison correction was performed using the Bonferroni method (i.e. multiplying the individual p-values by the number of tests; 6 in this case). 


### Illustration of the overall learning + evaluation process 
  
We provide a detailed illustration, for a given run of five-fold cross-validation (i.e. set of all five iterations of five-fold cross-validation). See  . Here, we first divided the participants into five folds, approximately balanced for proportion of patients and controls. On the i-th iteration of outer cross-validation, we held out the i-th fold as the test set (i.e. outer test set). All participants not in fold i were used as the training set for that iteration (i.e. outer training set input to the learning algorithm LearnFMRI). LearnFMRI then computed accuracy scores for each combination of feature extraction algorithm and regularization parameter. To do so, the learning algorithm employed a four-fold cross validation (inner cross-validation) analysis for each possible combination. For a given combination, on the j-th iteration of inner cross-validation, we held out the j-th fold as the inner test set. All participants not in folds j or i were used as the inner training set for that inner iteration. Statistical comparisons between patients and controls during feature extraction were performed only on participants from the inner training set. The resulting statistical differences were used to extract features for the inner test set participants without using those participants' labels (patient versus control). The classifier was trained on the inner training participants (those not in either fold j or i) and tested on the inner test participants (in fold j). Accuracy results were averaged over the four inner cross-validation folds. In this way, (inner) cross-validated accuracy scores were computed for each combination of feature extraction and regularization parameter. LearnFMRI then chose the best combination, defined as that combination yielding the highest accuracy (proportion of correctly classified participants) over the four-fold inner cross-validation tests. That best combination specified the feature extraction algorithm and regularization parameter, which were then applied to all the participants in the outer training set (i.e. all participants not in fold i), resulting in a trained linear SVM classifier. The choice of feature extraction method and the trained classifier are the output of the learning algorithm. Their performance was then tested on participants in the outer test set (i.e. participants in fold i). 


### Visualization of machine learning analysis 
  
To gain insight into the automated diagnosis process, we analyzed the classifier weights for various fMRI-based features. The linear SVM learning algorithm produces a “weight” for each feature, which recall corresponds to a value extracted from one voxel or region or the correlations between two regions (see descriptions of feature extraction algorithms above). The weights for this classifier are presented in the   section of the Results. 

To visualize which brain regions a classifier used, we created a weight map by weighting each relevant region by the absolute value of its appropriate weight value. We did this only for the analysis of patients with very-severe MDD vs. controls using resting-state fMRI data, as this was the only analysis that performed significantly above chance. 



## Results 
  
### Demographics 
  
There were no significant differences between healthy controls and MDD patients in sex or age ( ). There were no significant differences among the three patient groups (mild-moderate MDD, severe MDD, and very-severe MDD) in terms of sex, age, age of MDD onset, illness duration, or duration of current MDD episode ( ). As expected, there were group differences in HRSD scores between patients and controls and among the three patient groups. There were also significant differences in MADRS scores, HAM-A scores, CGI scores among the three patient groups, which is consistent with severity categories defined by HRSD scores. 


### Classification results 
  
Based on ten repetitions of five-fold cross-validation, classification using resting-state fMRI data comparing MDD patients with very severe depression vs. controls achieved a sensitivity of 59%, specificity of 72% and accuracy of 66% ( ). This accuracy value was significantly above chance (p = 0.012, Bonferroni corrected for the 6 tests). Classification analyses using resting-state fMRI data with patients in the mild-moderate and severe depression groups did not achieve accuracies significantly above chance ( ). Interestingly, accuracies were not significantly above chance for classification using the emotional face task fMRI data for any of the three patient groups ( ). 


### Discriminating brain regions 
  
We applied LearnFMRI to resting-state fMRI data from all patients with very-severe MDD and healthy controls to derive one model. In this case, the learning algorithm selected pair-wise correlation feature extraction and the SVM regularization parameter value of C = 0.1. The regions considered for pair-wise correlation features come from the Harvard-Oxford atlas and are listed in  .   shows these regions, colour-coded based on the learned classifier weights and superimposed on one participant's anatomical scan.   shows the learned weights from the trained linear SVM classifier for all 325 pair-wise correlation features from the analysis of very severe depression vs. healthy controls using resting-state fMRI data. (There are subtleties in interpreting weight values from trained classifiers. See   for discussion. 



## Discussion 
  
In this study, we evaluated the performance of two-class automated classification (healthy controls vs. patients) for three groups of patients with MDD: mild-moderate MDD, severe MDD, and very-severe MDD. The main finding is that using pattern analysis of resting-state fMRI activity, the accuracy of learned classifier was significantly better than chance at classifying very severe depression versus healthy controls. However, the performance of the classifiers for distinguishing healthy versus mild-moderate depression and healthy versus severe depression, were only at the chance level. Another important finding is that fMRI activation patterns evoked by the emotional face processing task failed to show significant classification performance, for any of the MDD severity groups. Given the small sample size, our results should be considered as preliminary. 

The finding of higher classification accuracy for very severe depression is consistent with previous machine learning studies that showed significant correlations between prediction scores and symptom severity scores using structural and functional data. The classification accuracy of 66% for very severe depression is comparable to that of previous studies using working memory neural correlates and structural data ( ,  ). However, contrary to our results, those previous studies, using similar supervised SVM learners, could significantly distinguish controls from MDD with moderate severity (mean HRSD: 21–22) ( ,  ,  ). The inconsistencies in results could be partly explained by variations in methodology and MRI data, as we used resting-state fMRI data whereas those previous studies used structural MRI and emotional recognition task-dependent fMRI data. Given the lower accuracies for the classification of less severe depression groups, our results suggest that less severe forms of MDD may be heterogeneous and is likely to capture mild forms of depressive states such as dysthymia and anxiety or personality weighted conditions. As less severe forms of depression may be associated with mild brain abnormalities, it might be harder for the learning algorithm to find a meaningful boundary between these groups and controls in a small dataset. We may need larger sample to improve the power and enable the classifiers to distinguish these groups from healthy controls. Considering that the need for machine learning methods in the diagnosis of milder depression would be greater in clinical practice than that of more severe form of depression, the poor accuracy in the classification of milder depression by machine learning methods shown in this study may limit its use as a tool in the early detection of milder or subthreshold depression. However, results based on small sample size precludes any conclusions on clinical utility. In addition, although our current classifier yielded significant classification for very severe depression, the clinical utility of this current system may be limited by its modest specificity (72%). Again, this needs to be tested in larger and independent samples. 

The brain regions that contributed to the classification of very severe depression included the various prefrontal and limbic regions listed in  . These regions have been reported to have abnormal structure and function in group-level analyses between patients with MDD and healthy control ( ,  ,  ). Moreover, the resting-state functional connectivity between prefrontal, insula and anterior cingulate regions was found to be positively correlated with severity of depression in univariate analysis ( ,  ), which is consistent with our findings, and suggests the greater contribution of these networks in the classification of very severe depression from healthy controls. 

Although previous fMRI studies using univariate analysis showed significant correlation between severity of depressive symptoms and alteration in regional brain activity due to emotional tasks or stimuli, our results failed to show significant accuracy in distinguishing healthy controls from depression patients, grouped at three levels of severity. Of course, this may be due to the different objectives, as univariate correlations (at the class level) are neither sufficient nor necessary for effective classification performance. In addition, this behavior could be due to low reliability of the task or poor variance of task-related activation between the three depression groups and the control group. Alternatively, this may be due to the small sample sizes here, coupled with the complexity of the emotional task. Although this is the first study to use an emotional-face matching task in fMRI machine learning analysis, several studies used this paradigm to elicit responses in neural regions and circuits implicated in emotional processing ( ,  ). Previously published fMRI machine learning studies ( ,  ) used an emotional face recognition task that is more cognitively/perceptually demanding than the emotional face matching task used here. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the pattern of resting-state fMRI BOLD signals produced better classification of severe MDD than the fMRI patterns evoked by the emotional face matching task. 

The reasons for the better performance of the classifier using resting-state data than task related data remains speculative and could be related to the abnormalities of the default mode network (DMN) in MDD. DMN refers to spontaneously organized brain activities from a network of brain regions including anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule ( ), which is activated during rest and deactivated during active tasks ( ). Previous studies of MDD showed increased resting-state functional connectivity of the DMN areas especially in anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal regions ( ) and decreased functional connectivity in bilateral prefrontal areas of DMN during emotional processing tasks ( ). Furthermore, higher levels of rumination about depressive symptoms was found to be correlated with higher DMN dominance ( ) and severe depressive symptoms ( ). It is therefore possible that the increased levels of rumination and associated increased DMN activity during the resting stage may have contributed for the greater performance of the classifier for very severe depression, whereas the lack of activation in DMN due to reduction in rumination during the engagement with the task may partly explain the poor performance of the classifier with task related data. 

### Methodological issues 
  
As mentioned above, a major limitation of the study is the small sample size, which might have influenced our results. Although previous machine learning studies in MDD achieved higher accuracies using small datasets ( ,  ,  ), yet larger studies in two independent samples are needed to develop and test predictive models that are sufficiently stable to use in clinical practice. Recent machine learning studies using structural MRI have recommended participant groups with 130 participants or more per group to learn an effective classification for schizophrenia versus healthy controls ( ). However, there are no clear guidelines on required sample sizes for machine learning studies using resting and task-related fMRI data in patients with MDD. Additionally, owing to our unbalanced sample between MDD (N = 45) and healthy controls (N = 19), we did not examine the accuracy of classification of MDD as a single group vs. healthy controls. Another major methodological issue is the categorization of MDD severity groups based on HDRS scores. As mentioned previously, there is no consensus on the validity of cutoffs on HDRS for defining the severity categories. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Handbook of Psychiatric Measures recommended the following thresholds to define grades of severity on HRSD: mild to moderate ≤ 18, severe 19–22, very severe ≥ 23 ( ). In contrast, others have used 20 as the cutoff to distinguish severe depression from mild to moderate ( ) and 24 or 25 as the cutoff to distinguish severe from very-severe depression ( ,  ). As there is very limited empirical research in this area, we used other severity measures such as MADRS and CGI scores to corroborate the severity categories defined by HDRS (see  ). A third potential issue is that we used linear SVM classifiers. We focused on this algorithm because it offers the advantage that one can examine the learned weights and attempt to interpret how the classifier is using the input features to produce a classification prediction. It is possible that other machine learning classifiers such as the non-linear radial basis function (RBF) SVM will yield better accuracy in this context. Unfortunately, it is difficult to provide a simple, straightforward interpretation of how algorithms such as RBF SVM produce predictions for a given individual. This difficulty of interpretation presents a barrier to deployment in the clinic, as medical practitioners place a high degree of importance on being able to interpret and evaluate the predictions of any automated clinical decision-making system. 



## Conclusions 
  
Resting-state brain activity provides a statistically significant classification of healthy controls vs. patients with very severe MDD (HRSD scores ≥ 24) but not for less severe depression. Moreover, even the classification accuracy that our approach achieved for very severe MDD is not sufficient from a clinical perspective. The negative results of our study help to focus the future efforts of our community, on considering larger sample sizes. We anticipate this may lead to better results that may provide clinically meaningful classification results for MDD based on severity.

# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is recognized as one of the most effective treatments for heroin addiction but its effect is dimmed by the high incidence of heroin relapse. However, underlying neurobiology mechanism of heroin relapse under MMT is still largely unknown. Here, we took advantage of a resting-state fMRI technique by analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo), and tried to explore the difference of brain function between heroin relapsers and non-relapsers in MMT. 


## Methods 
  
Forty MMT patients were included and received a 12-month follow-up. All patients were given baseline resting-state fMRI scans by using a 3.0 T GE Signa Excite HD whole-body MRI system. Monthly self-report and urine test were used to assess heroin relapse or non-relapse. Subjective craving was measured with visual analog scale. The correlation between ReHo and the degree of heroin relapse was analyzed. 


## Results 
  
Compared with the non-relapsers, ReHo values were increased in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex, right caudate, and right cerebellum of the heroin relapsers while those in the left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and precuneus were decreased in heroin relapsers. Importantly, altered ReHo in the right caudate were positively correlated with heroin relapse rates or subjective craving response. 


## Conclusions 
  
Using the resting-state fMRI technique by analysis of ReHo, we provided the first resting-state fMRI evidence that right caudate may serve as a potential biomarker for heroin relapse prediction and also as a promising target for reducing relapse risk.

## Background 
  
Drug addiction is a kind of chronic cerebral dysfunction [ ]. Unlike cocaine and cannabis popular in foreign countries, heroin is popular in China [ ]. Compared with cocaine and cannabis, heroin causes more tolerance and addiction. More seriously, once addicted with heroin, it is hard to abstinence [ ]. Currently, methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is a main strategy for the treatment of heroin addiction [ ]. However, unfortunately, MMT cannot completely solve the problem of heroin abuse due to the fact that the relapse rate still remained high under MMT [ ]. Apart from psychological and social factors, many researchers believed that neurobiological factors were also involved in heroin addiction and relapse [ ]. 

In recent years, a body of studies have been making the attempt on neural circuits and brain functions in heroin addiction by using resting-state fMRI method. By comparing heroin addicts with healthy controls, researchers revealed a heroin-related organization pattern. For instance, Ma et al. [ ] observed the enhanced functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the ventral cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), or the amygdala whereas the decreased functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate and the prefrontal cortex or the OFC was evident in heroin addicts. With the graph theory analysis, Liu et al. [ ] found dysfunctional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, insula, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, and ventral striatum in chronic heroin users. Therefore, resting-state fMRI method could not only reveal the abnormal baseline function in heroin users at the resting state, but also show the abnormal functional connectivity of two remote areas. 

Recently, the regional homogeneity (ReHo) method [ ] has been developed to analyse the similarities or coherence of intraregional spontaneous low-frequency (<0.08 Hz) blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations in voxel-wise analysis across the whole brain. Due to independence of the onset time of stimulus, this method is useful for resting-state fMRI data analysis to indicate the resting state in a given brain region. It has been used to investigate the functional modulations in the resting state in healthy aging subjects [ ] and in patients with Alzheimer disease [ ], Parkinson disease [ ], schizophrenia [ ], and neuromyelitis optica [ ]. Importantly, using this method, Qiu et al. [ ] revealed that ReHo values in the bilateral OFC and medial thalamic of heroin addicts were lower than that in healthy subjects. However, at present we still lacked the knowledge about the changes of ReHo between heroin relapse and non-relapse patients receiving MMT. 

In the present study, we included forty heroin addicts, and by using the resting-state fMRI technique to investigate the difference of resting-state brain function between heroin relapser and non-relapser in MMT patients by analysis of ReHo changes, trying to provide a further insight into the neurobiological mechanism underlying heroin relapse in MMT patients. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Sixty male former heroin addicts were recruited from the outpatient of the Baqiao Methadone Maintenance Treatment Center in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, China. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they (a) met the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) for heroin addiction; (b) willingly received long-term and stable MMT; (c) received at least three-month MMT; (d) were right-handed as judged by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ]. Patients were excluded if they (a) had a history of active neurological and psychiatric disorders besides heroin addiction, (b) had a history of head trauma, medical disorder requiring immediate treatment, and contraindications to MRI examination. 

Additionally, co-morbidity of addiction and psychiatric disorders is very common in heroin addicts, and to avoid the potential influence of psychiatric symptoms, we excluded the patients who reported having a current or past psychiatric illness other than heroin addiction, as described in exclusion criteria. We also evaluated the baseline psychological problems which usually accompanied with heroin addiction, such as depression and anxiety. The Beck Depression Inventory II and Hamilton Anxiety Scale were used to evaluate the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms respectively. There were no significant differences in depression severity and anxiety level between groups (data not shown). 

This study was approved by Institutional Board of the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi’an, China and conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki. All participants were fully informed about the details of experiment and signed the written consents for their involvement and The proposed protocol conforms to the Good Clinical Practice and has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Shaanxi, China. 


### Experiment design and procedure 
  
There were 60 participants recruited in the study. According to the inclusion criteria exclusion criteria, 20 participants were excluded for having other active neurological and psychiatric disorders, head trauma, or contraindications to MRI examination, and 40 were included and then received a baseline resting-state fMRI scanning following with a succeeding 12-month clinical follow-up. During the follow-up, they were supervised under monthly structured interview and urine tests. The participants with once self-reported heroin use or/and positive urine tests were defined as heroin relapser, and those with negative results in tests were defined as non-relapser. Relapse rate of each heroin relapser was calculated as following: total numbers of positive results in tests during MMT/12. The subjective heroin craving was assessed by a 0–10 score visual analogue scale (VAS). 


### Image acquisition 
  
All MRI scans were conducted on a Signa EXCITEHD 3.0 T scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, USA) with an eight-channel head coil. A routine T WI structural scan (parameters: TR = 5100 ms, TE = 117 ms, matrix = 416 × 416, FOV = 24 × 24 cm , slice thickness = 5.5 mm, gap = 0.8 mm) was performed to exclude gross cerebral pathology and then a BOLD functional imaging data was acquired using T2*-weighted gradient-echo planar imaging pulse sequence (GE-EPI, 32 axial slices covering the whole brain, 150 volumes). The parameters were set as follows: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, matrix = 64 × 64, FOV = 256 × 256 mm , slice thickness = 4 mm, gap = 0 mm; spatial resolution = 4 × 4 × 4 mm . The corresponding high-resolution fast spoiled gradient-echo 3D T -weighted images were also collected for anatomical overlays of the functional data and for spatial normalization of the datasets to a standard atlas and settings were as following: TR = 7.8 ms, TE = 3.0 ms, matrix = 256 × 256, FOV = 256 × 256 mm , spatial resolution =1 × 1 × 1 mm . 


### Data processing and regional homogeneity calculation 
  
Data preprocessing was performed with software (SPM12;  ) as described previously [ ]. In brief, for each participant the first 10 time points were discarded to avoid transient signal changes before magnetization reached steady state. Translation and rotation were checked and subjects with head movements exceeding than 1 mm in any direction or head rotations greater than 1° were discarded. After the motion correction, spatial normalization was made to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template (resampling voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm ). The T1-weighted high-resolution image volume was also spatially normalized to the MNI template. All images spatially normalized to MNI template were transformed to Talairach and Tournoux coordinates and then filtered by using a band-passed filter (0.01–0.08 Hz) to reduce the effect of low-frequency drifts and high-frequency noise. All the data was collected and analyzed by an author (Y.B.L., 5 years of experience in fMRI analysis) who was blinded to the present study. 

For regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis, the data were processed with a software (REST1.8;  ). The ReHo calculation procedure was performed as previously reported [ ]. In brief, it was performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis by calculating the Kendall Coefficient of Concordance (KCC) of the time series of a given voxel and that of its nearest neighbors. To reduce the influence of individual variation in the KCC, ReHo maps were normalized to the KCC of each voxel by the averaged KCC of the whole brain. The resulting data were then smoothed spatially with a 6-mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel to reduce noise and residual differences in gyral anatomy. 


### Statistical analysis 
  
To analyse the differences of ReHo values between heroin relapse and non-relapse patients under MMT, a two-sample   t   test was performed on the individual normalized ReHo maps in a voxel-by-voxel manner. A probability of   p   < 0.05 (corrected by FDR) was considered statistically significant. 


### Correlation analysis 
  
To evaluate the association of altered ReHo in different brain regions with heroin relapse in these relapsers, we performed Spearman's correlation analysis between mean ReHo values and relapse rates (as defined above) or subjective heroin craving indicated by VAS scores of each heroin relapser. The correlation analysis was based on non-parametric Spearman correlations and included only the relapsers. Threshold levels of significance for correlation coefficients were adjusted for multiple comparisons by a Bonferroni’s correction (  p   value was set as 0.05, and the number of tests was 8). 



## Results 
  
Sixty male former heroin addicts were recruited in the present study. Due to head motion, abnormal brain structure and incomplete outcome data, forty were finally included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After 12-month follow-up, 21 participants were classified as relapsers according to the defined criteria for relapse, and 19 as non-relapsers. There were no significant differences between heroin relapsers and non-relapsers in their age, education, number of cigarettes smoked per day, duration of cigarette smoking, duration of heroin abuse and daily/accumulated dosage of heroin/methadone (Table  ).

Compared with heroin non-relapsers, the relapsers showed significant increases of ReHo in the bilateral medial OFC, right caudate nucleus, and right cerebellum bilateral, but significant decreases of ReHo in the left parahippocampal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, right precuneus, and left middle temporal gyrus (Fig.   and Table  ).   
Data show brain areas with abnormal ReHo in heroin relapsers compared with non-relapsers under MMT. The differences are shown on whole-brain MR rendering (  a  ) and MR axial view (every 3 mm,   b  ). Relapsers displayed increased ReHo in the bilateral medial OFC, right caudate, and right cerebellum (  red  ) but decreased ReHo in the left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and precuneus (  blue  ).

We then analyzed the association of altered ReHo values in the identified regions (including bilateral medial OFC, right caudate, right cerebellum, left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and right precuneus) with relapse rates or with subjective heroin craving in relapse patients. Our results showed a positive correlation was observed between mean ReHo values in the right caudate and relapse rates or heroin craving whereas no correlation relationships were found between ReHo values and other brain regions (Tables   and  ). Additionally, we also made the correlation between the amount of motion in each subject and the ReHo values, and found a negative result (data not shown), indicating that head motion was not biasing the ReHo.

## Discussion 
  
In this study we carried out a 12-month follow-up study using resting-state fMRI by analysis of brain regions with abnormal ReHo in heroin relapsers under MMT, and found that compared with the non-relapsers, an increased ReHo values were evident in the bilateral medial OFC, right caudate nucleus, and right cerebellum of the heroin relapsers while a decreased ReHo in the left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and precuneus. Moreover, ReHo values in right caudate nucleus were correlated with relapse rates or subjective heroin-craving response. 

The medial OFC is a part of the limbic system, and is a functionally heterogeneous region that involved in complex adaptive behaviors. It was reported that in active cocaine abusers, OFC was hypermetabolic in proportion to the intensity of the craving experienced by the subjects [ ] but was hypoactive in drug-addicted subjects tested during withdrawal [ ]. Increased OFC activation has also been associated with drug-related cues [ ], and compulsive drug intake [ ,  ]. Importantly, a preclinical study showed that damage to the OFC resulted in a behavioral compulsion to procure the reward even when it is no longer reinforced [ ]. In the present study, we found increased ReHo in the bilateral medial OFC in the heroin relapsers under MMT, indicating an enhanced local synchronization of spontaneous low-frequency blood oxygenation level-dependent fluctuations in this region, and probably reflecting abnormalities of relapsers in the affective value of reinforcers, decision making and expectation. 

Caudate nucleus (dorsal striatum) is a principal brain region of mesostriatum dopamine (DA) pathway and is recognized to contribute to drug addiction [ ]. A group of study have demonstrated that in the caudate nucleus existed significant DA changes when addicts were exposed to drug-related cues, and the magnitude of these changes were correlated with self-reports of craving [ ,  – ]. For the drug-dependent patients, the enhanced activity in the caudate in response to drug-related cues indicated increased reward-based cognitive processes in the presence of the cues [ ]. These studies disclosed that the caudate nucleus may be a crucial link between conditional and behavioral responses to procure drug and the DA activity responding to drug-related cues, which mediates the habitual nature of subjective experience of caving and compulsive drug-seeking behaviors in addicts [ ,  ]. In this study, we found that heroin relapsers’ ReHo values in right caudate were higher than non-relapsers, suggesting that relapsers had an abnormal reward response relative to the non-relapser even in the resting-sate. 

Another area of the brain with increased ReHo in the present study was the cerebellum, which is reportedly involved in addictive behavior. Previous PET and fMRI studies revealed that drug-conditioned cue could activate the cerebellum and increased its metabolism [ ,  ]. When addicts performed reward expectation tasks, glucose metabolism in their cerebellum was greatly increased [ ]. These results suggested the cerebellum was involved in drug-conditioned memories in addicts. Since cerebellum and caudate are the primary site of rewarding feeling, increased ReHo values in these areas in the relapsers under MMT probably indicated an abnormal enhancement of rewarding effect on heroin or heroin-related cues, leading to compulsive drug-seeking behaviors and ultimately increasing the possibility of heroin relapse. Additionally, cerebellum is also related to learning and memory, increased ReHo in cerebellum may result in abnormal enhancement of positive or negative emotions during drug addiction, which in this study, may induce the occurrence of heroin relapse behaviors. 

In contrast, ReHo in several brain areas, especially in precuneus, were significantly decreased in heroin relapsers relative to non-relapsers. Apart from extension of the visuo-spatial processes subserved by the lateral parietal cortices, precuneus also plays an important role in a diverse array of highly integrated functions, e.g., involving in voluntary attention shifts between targets and playing a central role in the modulation of conscious process [ ]. Precuneus could integrate information, which related to drug cues in the environment with the previously learned association involving those cues and relaying that information to the prefrontal cortex [ ]. We still lacked the knowledge about the decreased ReHo in precuneus of MMT relapsers. This may be associated with the destruction or clinical deficits of precuneus-related visual spatial attention and consciousness in heroin relapsers. 

Moreover, we observed a positive correlation between altered ReHo values in the right caudate and relapse rates or heroin craving. These findings support the idea that heroin relapse and craving were related to the caudate nucleus, which plays an important role in the habitual nature of subjective experience of caving and compulsive drug-seeking behaviors in drug addicts [ ,  ]. Importantly, it also suggests that right caudate nucleus may not only serve as a reliable biomarker for predicting heroin relapse but also as a promising target for the treatment of MMT relapse. 

Admittedly, some limitations in the present are worth noting. First, in this study, female subjects were not included. Thus, a possible gender difference in relapse susceptibility was unexplored. Second, the interval of monthly self-report and urine test to assess MMT relapse was relatively long, probably not reflecting the true relapse rates. Finally, it had certain limitations by using urine test to assess the severity of MMT relapse. In addition, in spite of the results obtained above, we still lacked the knowledge about which neural circuit played the crucial role in the relapse behavior in heroin addicts receiving MMT. Therefore, other analysis methods such as fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, degree of centrality maps, and the other metrics provided by resting-state fMRI should be employed to analyze the relationship of resting functional characteristics and relapse need further exploration. 


## Conclusion 
  
In summary, compared with non-relapsers, heroin relapsers had an abnormal resting-state function. Specially, relapsers displayed increased ReHo in the bilateral medial OFC, right caudate, and right cerebellum but decreased ReHo in the left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and precuneus. The alterations of ReHo in these areas may involve abnormal motivation, reward, memory and visual spatial attention. Overall, our results may add to neurobiological factors associated with relapse to heroin use and also be conducive to developing a promising strategy for heroin addiction therapies.

# Title

Neurofunctional Abnormalities during Sustained Attention in Severe Childhood Abuse

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
Childhood maltreatment is associated with adverse affective and cognitive consequences including impaired emotion processing, inhibition and attention. However, the majority of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in childhood maltreatment have examined emotion processing, while very few studies have tested the neurofunctional substrates of cognitive functions and none of attention. This study investigated the association between severe childhood abuse and fMRI brain activation during a parametric sustained attention task with a progressively increasing load of sustained attention in 21 medication-naïve, drug-free young people with a history of childhood abuse controlling for psychiatric comorbidities by including 19 psychiatric controls matched for psychiatric diagnoses, and 27 healthy controls. Behaviorally, the participants exposed to childhood abuse showed increased omission errors in the task which correlated positively trend-wise with the duration of their abuse. Neurofunctionally, the participants with a history of childhood abuse, but not the psychiatric controls, displayed significantly reduced activation relative to the healthy controls during the most challenging attention condition only in typical attention regions including left inferior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula and temporal areas. We therefore show for the first time that severe childhood abuse is associated with neurofunctional abnormalities in key ventral frontal-temporal sustained attention regions. The findings represent a first step towards the delineation of abuse-related neurofunctional abnormalities in sustained attention, which may help in the development of effective treatments for victims of childhood abuse.

## Introduction 
  
There is increasing interest in understanding the effects of childhood adversities on the developing brain, given evidence that early environmental factors can have a substantial influence on the emerging brain architecture and long-term health of the person [ ]. Childhood maltreatment, including physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect is common in the United Kingdom with pediatric prevalence rates of 7–10% [ ]. Furthermore, childhood adversities are significantly associated with first onsets of various psychiatric disorders including mood, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) [ ]. 

The psychopathological outcomes associated with childhood maltreatment may be mediated by the disruption of cognitive processes and their associated neural underpinnings [ ]. Childhood maltreatment has been associated with adverse cognitive consequences such as low IQ and poor academic performance alongside impaired functions of motor and interference inhibition, sustained and selective attention, emotion and reward processing [ , ]. In particular, several neuropsychological studies have reported auditory [ , ] and visual [ – ] attention deficits in childhood maltreatment. Sustained attention, the ability to keep one’s mind continuously focused on a particular task, is a key dimension of attention control [ ]. It is important for mature adult goal-directed behavior, thought to underpin “higher-level” attention processes such as selective and divided attention as well as general cognitive ability [ ]. Children with maltreatment-related PTSD [ ] and institutionalized children made more omission errors compared to healthy controls during sustained attention tasks, which was furthermore related to longer institutional care [ , ]. In adults, childhood physical abuse and neglect have also been associated with sustained attention deficits [ ]. Additionally, population-based studies report significant associations between childhood maltreatment and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) like inattentive symptoms [ , ]. 

Despite the consistent neuropsychological findings of attention deficits in individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment, no fMRI study, to date, has examined sustained attention in this population The majority of fMRI studies in childhood maltreatment have examined brain function during emotion processing, given neuropsychological evidence of an attention bias and an increased sensitivity to angry and fearful expressions in maltreated children [ – ] and adults [ ]. These studies found abnormally enhanced activation of fronto-limbic regions in response to negative emotions, in particular to angry and fearful facial expressions, in maltreated children/adolescents [ – ] and adults [ – ] relative to healthy controls, suggesting behavioral and neurofunctional hypersensitivity to fear and anger. 

However, very few fMRI studies have tested cognitive processes known as “executive functions” which are particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of stress [ ]. Executive functions include facets of high-order cognitions such as inhibition, working memory and sustained attention [ ]. Using motor inhibition tasks, young people with a history of childhood maltreatment showed increased activation in inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during successful inhibition [ , ] and in typical dorsomedial prefrontal/ACC error-processing regions during failed inhibition [ ]. In adults, a history of childhood maltreatment was associated with decreased functional connectivity of IFC and dorsal ACC during successful inhibition, which was furthermore related to impulsiveness and inattentive symptoms [ ]. Using visual/verbal working memory tasks, childhood physical abuse was associated with reduced left cortical functioning in the frontal and temporal lobes in adults who were severely abused during childhood [ ]. Also, higher levels of early childhood stress were associated with poorer spatial working memory in adolescents, and this relationship was mediated by smaller grey matter volume in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) near the ACC and frontal poles [ ]. 

Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of structural MRI studies and reviews of both structural and functional MRI studies in childhood maltreatment show that individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment have deficits predominantly in two neuronal systems; one consisting of orbitofrontal-limbic circuits of top-down affect control, and another in the ventral attention system, in particular the ventral PFC, which is crucial for top-down cognitive control and sustained attention [ , – ]. Hence, the findings suggest that the frontal-limbic regions are compromised both at the structural level and functional level during emotional processing in childhood maltreatment. On a similar vein, the findings that the (ventral) PFC is compromised anatomically [ , ] and functionally during executive functions in childhood abuse [ – , ] and that structural deficits in the PFC mediated the relationship between childhood stress and poorer working memory [ ] seem to suggest that that the ventral PFC may also be functionally impaired during sustained attention. 

The aim of this study was therefore to test the hypothesis that medication-naïve, drug-free young people with a documented history of childhood physical abuse would exhibit activation deficits during sustained attention. Given that the fronto-parieto-temporal regions that mediate sustained attention develop relatively late in childhood and have been shown to be progressively more activated with increasing age between childhood and adulthood in fMRI studies [ , ], it is conceivable that childhood maltreatment interferes with the normal functional development of the ventral attention network. For this purpose, we used a parametrically modulated vigilance task requiring target detection with a progressively increasing load of sustained attention. Sexual abuse was excluded as it has been associated with different brain structure [ ], behavioral and psychiatric consequences [ – ]. In particular, both childhood physical abuse and neglect, but not sexual abuse, were associated with alterations in regional corpus callosum size [ ] and with grey matter reduction in a distributed corticostriatal-limbic system [ ]. In terms of psychiatric and behavioral effects, childhood sexual but not physical abuse was associated with suicidal behaviour [ ], self-injury [ ], adulthood sexual dysfunction [ ], and having at least two symptoms of schizophrenia [ ]. Youth with childhood sexual abuse also reported more externalizing and internalizing problems over time than maltreated but non-sexually abused youth [ ], and victims of childhood sexual abuse reported more severe mental pain compared with physical abuse victims [ ]. Scholars have also argued that childhood sexual abuse is associated with experiences or feelings unique to sexual victimization relative to other abuse and neglect experiences; for example, traumatic sexualization, betrayal, stigmatization, attributions of responsibility as well as feelings of guilt and shame collectively may impact victims of childhood sexual abuse more profoundly and/or differently than victims of other abuse experiences [ , ]. For these reasons, and in order to obtain a more homogenous group, we only included children with physical abuse. 

However, although the current study initially aimed to examine the neural correlates of sustained attention in young people exposed to physical abuse in childhood, it is unrealistic to separate physical abuse from typically co-occurring emotional abuse and neglect [ , ]. Claussen et al even noted that psychological maltreatment would be present in   almost all   cases of physical maltreatment. Hence, it is unlikely for the abused victim to experience   severe   physical abuse without experiencing at least moderate levels of emotional abuse and neglect concurrently; on the other hand, physical abuse does not always co-occur with sexual abuse. 

Previous imaging studies in childhood maltreatment have several limitations such as not formally assessing and controlling for the presence of any co-occurring psychiatric conditions and/or substance abuse as well as the use of region of interest (ROI) analyses [ ] which limits the search to a-priori hypothesized regions and provides a biased and inappropriately constrained characterization of anatomy or function [ ]. In particular, given that large-scale epidemiological and longitudinal studies have consistently found that childhood maltreatment is linked developmentally to psychiatric disorders [ , , ] and a meta-analysis study reported a causal relationship between non-sexual childhood maltreatment and a range of mental disorders [ ], it is crucial to control for these in order to disentangle the effects of maltreatment from those associated with psychopathology [ , – ]. Additionally, although some studies examined the neural correlates of childhood maltreatment in “healthy” participants [ – , ], they relied solely on parental and/or participant’s self-ratings on clinical measures; hence, in the absence of a formal psychiatric assessment by a child psychiatrist, it remains unclear if these participants were without any psychiatric disorders at the point of testing. To assess the specificity of the association with childhood abuse, we therefore included a third group of psychiatric controls that was matched with the group with a history of childhood abuse on psychiatric comorbidities. Furthermore, to control for medication use or drug abuse, we included only participants who were drug-abuse free and medication-naïve. In addition, we conducted whole-brain analyses so that areas outside hypothesized regions would not be overlooked. 

Therefore, we hypothesized that participants with a documented history of childhood physical abuse would show activation deficits in typical fronto-parieto-temporal sustained attention regions [ ], in particular during the highest load of attention. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Seventy (23 young people with a history of childhood abuse, 20 psychiatric controls, and 27 healthy controls) right-handed, medication-naïve, drug-free and age-matched young people came to the laboratory for two sessions, and those below the age of 18 were accompanied by their guardians on both visits. In the first visit, demographic, clinical and abuse measures and IQ data were collected and the participants were acclimated to the scanner environment with an MRI replica. The fMRI sustained attention task was administered in the MRI scanner on the second visit. All participants were assessed by a child psychiatrist (KM) using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) [ ] designed to generate ICD-10 and DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) [ ] and Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI) [ ] were used to provide psychopathology symptom scores. IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) [ ]. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) [ ] was used to measure the severity of childhood physical, emotional and sexual abuse as well as emotional and physical neglect. Socioeconomic status (SES) was measured by two non-sensitive items from the Family Affluence Scale (FAS) [ ] on housing tenure and room occupancy. 

Exclusion criteria for all participants were childhood sexual abuse, drug abuse, learning disability, neurological abnormalities, epilepsy, IQ < 70 and MRI contraindications. Urine screening for recent drug use was conducted with 10-panel urine drug test integrated cups (T-Cup;  ). All participants or their guardians if the participant was under the age of 18, provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Young people below the age of 18 were accompanied by their guardians during each visit and their guardians received the reimbursement for participating in the study on their behalf. The study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee London-Fulham. 

The 23 young people who experienced childhood physical abuse before the age of 12 were recruited through social services and psychiatric clinics. These young people, or their guardians if they were below the age of 18, were first asked to provide signed permission to contact their respective social services for written confirmation that there were official records of physical abuse. Next, the young people went on to complete the clinical interviews, abuse measures and IQ test and finally followed by the brain scan. The Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA) interview [ ] was used to corroborate the CTQ and provide additional information on the abuse experience such as the age or onset and duration of abuse. All the participants with a history of childhood abuse scored ≥ 13 (i.e. the cut-off for severe/extreme physical abuse) [ ] on the CTQ physical abuse subscale, and information from the CECA interview [ ] and the CTQ were consistent with the official records. Psychiatric comorbidities included PTSD, depression, anxiety, conduct disorder and phobia. Two participants were excluded due to MRI motion artefacts, leaving a final sample of 21 participants (mean age 17.5, 15 male). 

Twenty psychiatric controls were recruited through social services and psychiatric clinics. They had experienced no maltreatment (CTQ subscale scores of ≤ 7 for physical abuse, ≤ 8 for emotional abuse, ≤ 6 for sexual abuse, ≤ 9 for emotional neglect and ≤ 7 for physical neglect). The purpose of the inclusion of the psychiatric control group was to disentangle the effects due to maltreatment from those due to the psychiatric conditions that are typically associated with maltreatment. Therefore, diagnoses for both psychiatric controls and maltreated participants were made by the same experienced child psychiatrist (KM) using the same instrument, the DAWBA, and diagnoses were matched as closely as possible one-to-one with participants from the group with a history of childhood abuse. If there was any uncertainty regarding DAWBA diagnoses, Professor Robert Goodman, the psychiatrist responsible for the development of the DAWBA, checked and confirmed the diagnosis. The group with a history of childhood abuse and the psychiatric control group were well matched on psychiatric conditions ( ). Where psychiatric controls had PTSD, the causal trauma(s) were unrelated to childhood maltreatment and included bullying by peers, living in Afghanistan during the war, witnessing murder, experiencing a car accident and death of a loved one. One participant was excluded due to motion artefacts, leaving a final sample of 19 patients (mean age 16.9, 9 male).

The 27 healthy controls (mean age 17.5, 21 male) with no history of psychiatric illness and childhood maltreatment (scoring below the same cut-offs as above) were recruited through advertisements in the same geographic areas of South London to ensure similar socioeconomic background ( ). 

The methodology is similar to that reported in an earlier study [ ] as the participants completed two additional fMRI tasks (stop and emotion processing), reported elsewhere [ ]. 


### fMRI Paradigm: Sustained Attention Task (SAT) 
  
Participants practiced the task once prior to scanning. The 12-min SAT is a variant of psychomotor vigilance and delay tasks [ , ]. Participants need to respond as quickly as possible to the appearance of a visual timer counting up in milliseconds via a right hand button response within 1s. The visual stimuli appear either after short, predictable consecutive delays of 0.5s, in series of 3–5 stimuli (260 in total), or after unpredictable time delays of 2s, 5s or 8s (20 each), pseudo-randomly interspersed into the blocks of 3–5 0.5s delays. The long, infrequent, unpredictable delays place a higher load on sustained attention/vigilance while the short, predictable 0.5s delays are typically anticipated [ ] placing a higher demand on sensorimotor synchronization [ , , ] ( ).

Subjects are required to press a right-hand button as soon as they see a timer appear on the screen counting seconds. The counter appears after either predictable short delays of 0.5s in blocks of 3–5 stimuli, or after unpredictable long delays of 2s, 5s or 8s, pseudorandomly interspersed into the blocks of 0.5s delays. The long second delays have a progressively higher load on sustained attention than the short 0.5s delays that are typically anticipated and have a higher load on sensorimotor synchronization. 
  

### Performance Data Analysis 
  
Multiple repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVAs) with group as independent and delay as repeated measures were conducted to test for group (3 levels: Childhood abuse, Psychiatric controls, Healthy controls), delay (3 levels: 2s, 5s, 8s) and group by delay interaction effects using SPSS 18 on the following measures: mean reaction time (MRT), intra-subject variability of reaction time (SDintrasubject), omission and premature errors. A separate ANOVA for group differences for the short delays (0.5s) was also conducted on the same measures. Bonferroni adjustment was used for multiple comparisons. 


### fMRI Image Acquisition 
  
Gradient echo echo-planar MR imaging (EPI) data were acquired on a 3T GE Signa HDx system at the Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, King’s College London. Stimulus images were projected on a screen, clearly visible through prism placed in front of participants’ eyes. The body coil was used for RF transmission and an 8-channel head coil for RF reception. During the 12-minute run of the task, in each of 28 non-contiguous planes parallel to the anterior-posterior commissural, 480 T *-weighted MR images depicting Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast covering the whole brain were acquired with: echo time (TE) = 30ms, repetition time (TR) = 1.5s, 23 slices, flip angle = 70°, in-plane resolution = 3.75mm , field of view (FOV) = 240mm, slice thickness/gap = 5/0.5mm, matrix = 64 x 64. A high-resolution gradient EPI was also acquired for accurate spatial normalization (TE = 30ms, TR = 3s, 43 slices, flip angle = 90°, in-plane resolution = 1.875mm , FOV = 240mm, slice thickness/gap = 3/0.3mm, matrix = 128 x 128). 


### fMRI Image Analysis 
  
Image preprocessing and whole-brain analyses were carried out using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8,  ). Data were realigned to correct for subject movement and co-registered to the high-resolution gradient EPI, which was then used to estimate the parameters for spatially normalizing the data into a standard anatomical space (Montreal Neurological Institute). The resulting normalized volume time series was spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 8-mm full width at half maximum. 

Data were analyzed within the framework of the General Linear Model. A single-subject (1  level) model was created for each participant, including regressors encoding each experimental condition (long delays of 2s, 5s and 8s). The 0.5s short delay condition, which was not modelled and was used as an implicit baseline, was identical to the experimental conditions except for the delay period and hence controlled for visual stimulation and sensorimotor activation [ , ]. Each of these long delay conditions was contrasted with the 0.5s short delay condition that formed the implicit baseline. The model only examined correct trials; incorrect trials were omitted from the imaging analysis and included as covariates in the 1  level model so that the variance due to errors can be accounted for and group differences in neural activity during the correct trials do not reflect any group differences in task performance. The movement parameters from the realignment procedure were also included as covariates in the 1  level model. At the group-level, a whole-brain analysis was conducted using the SPM flexible factorial design model to examine the group by delay interaction effect, in which group was a between-subject factor (3 levels: Childhood abuse, Psychiatric controls, Healthy controls) and delay was a within-subject factor (3 levels: 2s, 5s, 8s). BOLD responses are reported using a family-wise error rate (FWE)-corrected cluster threshold of   p   < 0.05 and voxel threshold of   p   < 0.001. Next, mean BOLD contrast values for all voxels of significant clusters from the SPM flexible factorial analysis were extracted using MarsBaR ( ) and a 3 (group) x 3 (delay) repeated-measures ANOVA followed by post-hoc   t  -tests (correcting for multiple comparisons) at each delay were conducted using SPSS 18 to determine between-group differences at each delay. 

Finally, the significant clusters were also used to conduct exploratory correlation analyses with potential confounding variables such as IQ and age within each group, and with clinical and abuse measures (severity, age at onset and duration of abuse) within the group with a history of childhood abuse only. 



## Results 
  
### Subject Characteristics 
  
The groups did not differ significantly in age, gender, ethnicity and SES but differed significantly in IQ, as expected ( ). Large-scale epidemiological studies have consistently reported an association between childhood maltreatment and lower IQ and cognitive abilities [ – ]. Therefore, since lower IQ is associated with childhood maltreatment, covarying for IQ when groups are not randomly selected and the covariate is a pre-existing group difference that did not occur by chance violates ANCOVA assumptions [ , ]. The primary data analyses are thus presented without covarying for IQ. However, to rule out any potential influence of IQ, a correlation analysis of IQ with brain activation in significant clusters and an additional confirmatory analysis on a subsample of IQ-matched participants were also conducted (see additional confirmatory analyses). 

Although the study initially recruited participants with a history of childhood physical abuse, they also experienced marked/severe childhood emotional abuse and neglect ( ), which typically co-occur with physical abuse, and hence are a representative group of the childhood abuse population [ ]. 

Healthy controls scored significantly lower on BDI (  p   < 0.01) and all SDQ difficulties subscales (  p   < 0.001) than the group with a history of childhood abuse, as well as on BDI (  p   < 0.001), SDQ emotional problems (  p   < 0.001) and hyperactivity (  p   < 0.05) subscales than psychiatric controls. The group with a history of childhood abuse scored significantly higher than psychiatric controls on SDQ conduct (  p   < 0.01) and peer problems (  p   < 0.05) but lower on prosocial (  p   < 0.01) subscales ( ). 


### Task Performance 
  
Paralleling the fMRI analyses where the 0.5s delay condition was included as an implicit baseline, and given that the long delay conditions (2s, 5s and 8s) were the targets of interest tapping into vigilance, we analyzed the long delay separately from the short delay conditions to assess effects of group, delay and group by delay interaction. There was no significant group effect on MRT (F (2, 64) = 1.99,   p   = 0.15) and SDintrasubject (F (2, 64) = 1.40,   p   = 0.26). There was a significant group effect on omission (F (2, 64) = 3.16,   p   < 0.05) and premature errors (F (2, 64) = 3.51,   p   < 0.05), due to the group with a history of childhood abuse and psychiatric control group making more omission errors than healthy controls and the group with a history of childhood abuse making more premature errors than healthy controls ( ). There were no significant effects of delay or of group by delay interaction (see Table in   for 0.5s delay results).

### Brain Activation 
  
#### Motion 
  
Multivariate ANOVAs showed no significant group differences in maximum translation (Wilks’ Lambda F (6,124) = 1.67,   p   > 0.05) or maximum rotation (Wilks’ Lambda F (6,124) = 1.09,   p   > 0.05) parameters. 


#### Within Group Activations 
  
Within-group activations for each of the 3 delays are shown in   for each of the 3 groups. Briefly, healthy controls across the different delays had activation in a bilateral network comprising the SMA, paracentral lobule, middle and superior frontal gyri, superior temporal gyrus, insula, cingulate, post and precentral gyri, precuneus, cuneus, lingual, middle occipital gyrus, fusiform and cerebellum as well as in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and striatum ( ). The group with a history of childhood abuse had activation in a bilateral network comprising the SMA, paracentral lobule, middle and superior frontal gyri, superior temporal gyrus, insula, cingulate, post and precentral gyri, precuneus, cuneus, lingual, middle occipital gyrus, fusiform and cerebellum ( ). The psychiatric controls had activation in bilateral SMA, paracentral lobule, post and precentral gyri, precuneus, cingulate, insula and superior temporal gyrus ( ).

The group with a history of childhood abuse had significantly lower activation in the left IFC/DLPFC cluster (p<0.05) and at a trend-level in the left temporal/fusiform cluster (p = 0.09) compared to heathy controls. There were no significant differences between the psychiatric and healthy controls. 
  

#### Group Effect 
  
When all 3 delays were considered together, there were no significant group differences across all delays (see   for brain activations within each group and   for the main effect of delay). 


#### Group by Delay Interaction Effect 
  
As hypothesized, there was, however, a significant group by delay interaction effect in two clusters: The first cluster comprised left IFC, anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (  p   < 0.001). The second cluster comprised left inferior and middle temporal and fusiform areas (  p   < 0.001). Post-hoc analyses at each delay showed that the group with a history of childhood abuse had significantly reduced activation relative to healthy controls during the longest (8s) delay in the IFC cluster (  p   < 0.05) and at a trend-level in the temporal cluster (  p   = 0.09); however, they did not differ from psychiatric controls who did not differ from healthy controls ( ,  ).

#### Correlation Analyses 
  
To investigate whether the significant clusters of activation differences were associated with the main attention performance measure of omission errors and with clinical and abuse measures, BOLD values of each cluster for the 8s delay—with the greatest group differences—were extracted for each participant and correlated with omission errors at 8s within each group and with clinical and abuse measures (severity, age at onset and duration of abuse) within the group with a history of childhood abuse only. 

For healthy controls, omission errors correlated negatively with activation in the IFC cluster (r = -0.69,   p   < 0.001) and temporal cluster (r = -0.55,   p   < 0.01). No significant correlations between omission errors and activation were observed in the group with a history of childhood abuse and the psychiatric control group. For the group with a history of childhood abuse, omission errors correlated at a trend-level positively with the duration of abuse (r = 0.4,   p   = 0.06). There were no significant associations between brain activation and age of onset/duration of abuse or SDQ symptoms scores in the group with a history of childhood abuse. 


#### Additional (Confirmatory) Analyses 
  
Given that the group with a history of childhood abuse had significantly lower IQ than healthy controls, IQ was correlated with brain activation in the significant clusters and with the main performance measure of omission errors within each group. There were no significant correlations between IQ and brain activation or between IQ and omission errors ( ). Hence, higher brain activation or lesser omission error is not related to higher IQ and vice versa. Moreover, in order to further rule out the confounding effect of IQ on the findings, the analysis was repeated within a subgroup of IQ-matched sample (19 young people exposed to childhood abuse, 19 psychiatric controls and 18 healthy controls). All main findings remained significant in the IQ-matched subsample ( ). Hence, IQ differences were unlikely to explain the findings.

Axial slices are marked with the z coordinate as distance in millimetres from the anterior–posterior commissure. The right side of the image corresponds to the right side of the brain. 
  
Furthermore, given that many individuals in the group with a history of childhood abuse suffered from PTSD, which was matched in the psychiatric control group, we wanted to explore whether PTSD alone was associated with potential brain activation abnormalities. For this purpose, we compared the 25 PTSD patients with the 27 healthy controls and with the 42 participants without PTSD. There were no significant group differences suggesting that the functional abnormalities are related to the abuse experience rather than PTSD. 

Finally, we also controlled for variables such as gender, ethnicity and SES. The main findings remained significant when the extracted BOLD values of significant clusters were analyzed using repeated-measures ANCOVA in SPSS 18 covarying for these measures of gender, ethnicity and SES. Also, age did not correlate significantly with activation in the significant clusters or with omission errors within each group ( ). Thus, subtle and non-significant variations in these demographic factors were unlikely to have confounded the findings. 




## Discussion 
  
To our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study that examined the neurofunctional correlates of sustained attention in severe physical childhood abuse. We found that in a parametrically designed sustained attention task, medication-naïve and drug-free young people with a history of childhood physical abuse and concomitant neglect and emotion abuse relative to healthy controls exhibited increased omission errors, the main attention measure of the task, which furthermore was associated with a longer duration of abuse at a trend-level. At the neurofunctional level, only the group with a history of childhood abuse but not the psychiatric control group had reduced activation relative to healthy controls during the most challenging attention condition, the longest delay, in the ventral and dorsal frontal attention regions of left IFC, anterior insula and DLPFC as well as at a trend-level in middle and inferior temporal and fusiform areas. 

Young people with a history of childhood physical abuse most of who also had neglect and emotional abuse showed reduced activation relative to healthy controls during the most challenging attention condition in left hemispheric ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal regions that are known to be important for sustained attention such as IFC/anterior insula and DLPFC [ , , – ]. The anterior insula is implicated in high-level cognitive control and attention processes [ ] and together with IFC forms part of the ventral attention and salience network that facilitates the detection of important environmental stimuli, in this case the target stimuli [ , ]. The anterior insular/IFC network is thought to be involved in signaling the need for attentional effort to facilitate target detection, particularly under the more challenging condition of longer delays to prevent attentional drifts away from the task at hand [ , ]. The DLPFC plays a crucial role in top-down attention and is activated during visuospatial information processing and orienting of attention [ , ], including in this particular task version [ , , ]. Finally, the temporal and inferior occipito-temporal regions are known to be involved in bottom-up visuospatial attention processes [ , ]. The implication of these fronto-temporal regions in sustained attention is furthermore reinforced in this study as they were negatively correlated with omission errors in healthy controls, suggesting that the higher the activation the better the task performance. Our findings therefore suggest that young people with a history of childhood abuse have a deficit in top-down IFC/DLPFC attention control and at a trend-level in bottom-up visuospatial attention processing. 

The neurofunctional deficits during the longest delay may be abuse-related as they were not observed in the psychiatric control group, who did not differ from either the healthy control group or the group with a history of childhood abuse. This suggests that neurofunctional deficits in attention functions may be associated with abuse but also transfer to psychiatric complications. The findings of impairment in the most difficult condition only furthermore suggest that neurofunctional abnormalities during sustained attention in young people exposed to childhood abuse are intact in easier task conditions and manifest only during the most challenging condition. This is interesting in view of neurofunctional deficits in the same region of left DLPFC in this task in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ADHD [ , ] during all delay conditions. It suggests less pervasive neurofunctional attention deficits in childhood abuse relative to other childhood disorders of attention, as they only manifested during the most challenging attention condition and were not observed throughout all task conditions. 

The human brain is plastic and is continually modified by experience across development. Given that the IFC, DLPFC and temporal lobes are among the latest brain regions to develop structurally [ ] and functionally [ ], developing well into mid-adulthood, they may well be more susceptible to impairment following childhood adversity. In fact, our review [ ] and a recent meta-analysis of structural MRI studies [ ] in childhood abuse found grey matter abnormalities in the IFC, superior frontal and temporal regions. Furthermore, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies in childhood maltreatment also reported abnormalities in left hemispheric fronto-temporal white matter tracts, including the uncinate fasciculus [ ], arcuate fasciculus [ ] as well as the inferior [ ] and superior longitudinal fasciculus [ ]. Hence, functional abnormalities in these late-developing IFC/DLPFC and temporal regions during sustained attention may suggest an environmentally triggered disturbance in the normal development of these attention networks as a consequence of childhood abuse. 

At the performance level, the group with a history of childhood abuse made more omission errors than healthy controls, which was furthermore correlated with a longer duration of abuse. This is consistent with previous neuropsychological findings of more omission errors during sustained attention tasks in children with maltreatment-related PTSD [ ] and in children with longer institutional care [ ]. Furthermore, the frontal-temporal attention regions that were reduced in activation in the group with a history of childhood abuse during the longest delay condition were associated with less omission errors in healthy controls, suggesting that normally these regions are recruited for better performance while poor performance in the group with a history of childhood abuse may be due to poor recruitment of these regions. 

The strength of this study is that all participants were medication-naïve, drug-free and that the physical abuse experience was carefully assessed and corroborated by social service records. Also, we included a psychiatric control group to determine the specificity of abuse. The inclusion of a “pure” group with a history of childhood physical abuse without any psychiatric disorders would have been a stronger control group to determine abuse-specific deficits; however, they would not be representative of the general childhood abuse populations as severe abuse is typically associated with psychiatric comorbidities [ , – ]. Another limitation is that although the initial focus of the study was on childhood physical abuse, and sexual abuse was excluded as it has been shown to differ in many aspects [ ], including distinctive effects on the somatosensory cortex [ ], we cannot categorically state that the observed effects are a result of physical abuse exclusively as many participants also experienced neglect and emotional abuse. However, it is unrealistic to separate physical abuse from emotional abuse and neglect as the vast majority of maltreated children are subjected to more than one kind of abuse, with less than 5% of maltreatment occurring in isolation [ , ]. Moreover, using child protective services case records abstraction (physical, sexual, emotional abuse and neglect), latent class analysis revealed four distinctive profiles of childhood maltreatment experiences in which physical abuse was clustered with 1) neglect, 2) emotional abuse, 3) both neglect and emotional abuse and 4) neglect, emotional abuse and sexual abuse [ ]. Thus, there is a high degree of overlap among childhood physical abuse, emotional abuse and neglect but the abused victim may not necessary had experienced sexual abuse. Nonetheless, it is worth noting the limitation in generalizing the current findings to individuals with a history of childhood sexual abuse. 

The fact that IQ was not matched between the groups could be considered a limitation. However, since there was no significant correlation between IQ and brain activation in the two significant clusters and the findings remained in an additional confirmatory analysis on a subsample of IQ-matched participants, this suggests that IQ is unlikely to have confounded the findings. The lack of pubertal information is also a limitation given the significant development that occurs over this age range, particularly in the domain of executive functions. Also, it is unclear to what extent malnutrition, prenatal drug exposure and the presence of current life stressors may have influenced the findings. Finally, it is worth noting that comprehensive SES information has not been retrieved from parent/carer or social service report. 

### Conclusions 
  
In summary, we found that medication-naïve, drug-free young people with a history of childhood abuse, but not psychiatric controls, had functional activation deficits in typical sustained attention regions of IFC, DLPFC, insula and temporal areas compared to healthy controls during the longest and most challenging delay condition only. The findings represent a first step towards the delineation of abuse-related neurofunctional abnormalities in sustained attention, which may help in the development of effective treatments that target these regions.

# Title

Right Hemisphere Remapping of Naming Functions Depends on Lesion Size and Location in Poststroke Aphasia

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
The study of language network plasticity following left hemisphere stroke is foundational to the understanding of aphasia recovery and neural plasticity in general. Damage in different language nodes may influence whether local plasticity is possible and whether right hemisphere recruitment is beneficial. However, the relationships of both lesion size and location to patterns of remapping are poorly understood. In the context of a picture naming fMRI task, we tested whether lesion size and location relate to activity in surviving left hemisphere language nodes, as well as homotopic activity in the right hemisphere during covert name retrieval and overt name production. We found that lesion size was positively associated with greater right hemisphere activity during both phases of naming, a pattern that has frequently been suggested but has not previously been clearly demonstrated. During overt naming, lesions in the inferior frontal gyrus led to deactivation of contralateral frontal areas, while lesions in motor cortex led to increased right motor cortex activity. Furthermore, increased right motor activity related to better naming performance only when left motor cortex was lesioned, suggesting compensatory takeover of speech or language function by the homotopic node. These findings demonstrate that reorganization of language function, and the degree to which reorganization facilitates aphasia recovery, is dependent on the size and site of the lesion.

## 1. Introduction 
  
One-third of stroke survivors suffer from loss of language ability [ ,  ]. Recovery rates vary greatly, for reasons that are poorly understood [ ]. The relationships between lesion site, activity pattern changes, and recovered language functions remain unclear. 

### 1.1. Reorganization of Language Function after Stroke 
  
In neuroimaging studies, patterns of increased activation during language tasks in chronic aphasia have been broadly consistent across studies. In a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies, collapsing across a wide range of language tasks, we found that people with aphasia consistently overactivated perilesional regions in the left hemisphere, as well as right hemisphere regions that were homotopic to the left hemisphere language network [ ]. In particular, people with lesions in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were more likely to recruit right IFG than those without lesions in that area. However, the behavioral and biological drivers of these changes, as well as the degree to which they promote, inhibit, or are even relevant to recovery, remain open questions. 

The increased activation in the preserved left hemisphere in people with aphasia has generally been associated with overall better performance [ – ]. However, the relationship between lesion size, location, and ability to use these preserved regions has not been carefully examined. For example, particularly severe participants may have larger lesions or lesions in highly critical areas. If this is the case, then the relationship between left hemisphere activity and language performance may be indirect, in that both are actually dependent on the severity and size of the stroke itself, as well as the availability of left hemisphere tissue adjacent to the critical areas. 

Within the right hemisphere, the relationship between plasticity and language performance is even less clear. A number of lines of evidence suggest that engagement of the right hemisphere serves overall to support aphasia recovery (for review, see [ ]), suggesting a compensatory role for the right hemisphere homologues to language nodes. However, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies show that inhibiting the right IFG pars triangularis (PTr) improves fluency, naming, and other language measures in people with left hemisphere stroke [ – ]. This suggests that the right IFG, specifically right PTr, may be limiting recovery in people with left hemisphere lesions. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies show that early engagement of the right hemisphere during the acute phase promotes recovery but that disengagement of the right hemisphere in later stages is related to ongoing successful recovery [ – ]. Increased activation in the right hemisphere during the chronic stage of aphasia is associated with naming errors [ ] and overall worse performance, especially in picture-word naming and rhyme judgment [ ,  ]. 

Unfortunately, the same concerns arise when examining the function of the right hemisphere as were raised for the left, specifically, confounding with lesion size and location. The usefulness of a shift from right to left hemisphere activation during the chronic stages likely depends on the availability of remaining healthy left hemisphere tissue [ ]. Additionally, right hemisphere recruitment identified in neuroimaging studies may not be a consequence of plasticity at all. In neurologically healthy control subjects, right hemisphere activation has been shown to increase as a function of task difficulty [ ,  ]. Furthermore, right hemisphere activity appears to be greater in participants with larger overall left hemisphere lesions [ ], although this finding is only for some language tasks (picture naming, but not semantic judgment). Right hemisphere activity in people with aphasia, therefore, may actually be driven by the unique difficulty of the language tasks for people with aphasia. Right hemisphere activity may also reflect overactivation of any preserved tissue, of which there is less for people with large lesions, rather than actually remapping of function. However, the relationship between activity in the right hemisphere in people with aphasia, the rate of recovery, and actual plasticity remains unclear. 

Beyond the general anatomical patterns of reorganization and their association with good or bad outcomes, the mechanisms underlying reorganization remain unclear. Such mechanisms may include behaviorally driven reorganization, as in the plasticity induced by speech-language therapy [ ], or direct biological effects of the stroke itself. With regard to direct biological mechanisms underlying plasticity in language networks, relatively few specific hypotheses have been put forth. While some investigators, including ourselves, have previously described different patterns of reorganization (e.g., compensatory “takeover” by a new area), these descriptions do not generally hypothesize a specific biological basis for these changes. The great virtue of specific biological hypotheses is that they generate specific testable predictions, especially with regard to the timing of plasticity, the relationship of specific lesion features such as size and location to the pattern of reorganization, and the relationship of brain changes to behavioral outcomes. 

One such biological hypothesis which has gained a great deal of traction in recent years is the interhemispheric inhibition model, which is commonly invoked to explain recruitment of homotopic right hemisphere processors, negative relationships between right hemisphere activity and language performance, and the beneficial effects of right PTr inhibition [ ]. This hypothesis states that, in healthy people, there is transcallosal cross-hemispheric inhibition between language areas, similar to what has been demonstrated in motor areas [ ,  ]. A stroke in the left hemisphere theoretically disrupts the interhemispheric inhibitory balance, leading to overactivation of right hemispheric language areas homotopic to the lesion. In the context of the interhemispheric inhibition theory, the overactivated right hemisphere is thought to maladaptively inhibit perilesional left hemisphere areas, resulting in worse outcomes [ ]. 

In particular, the interhemispheric inhibition model makes at least three specific testable claims. First, larger lesions in the left hemisphere should be associated with more activity in the right hemisphere. Second, left hemisphere lesions should be associated with increased activity specifically in homotopic regions in the right hemisphere. Finally, increased right hemisphere activity in homotopic areas should be related to worse language abilities, even at the chronic stage. Some of the prior evidence regarding the latter two claims is outlined above. The predicted relationship between lesion size and right hemisphere recruitment is frequently mentioned in reviews on aphasia recovery either in the context of interhemispheric inhibition or based on the logical argument that if no left hemisphere tissue remains, the right hemisphere must be recruited for any recovery to occur [ ,  ,  ]. However, the empirical evidence supporting this relationship is lacking and based primarily on small case series using methods that do not control for the accuracy of task performance [ ]. 


### 1.2. Cognitive Models of Naming 
  
Lexical-retrieval processes involve accessing concept knowledge and mapping phonological representations, stored in long-term memory [ ] and these two stages are supported by distinct cortical regions. Phonological retrieval is ascribed to a ventral stream of processing, in which phonological representations in the posterior superior temporal lobe map onto semantic and conceptual information in the angular gyrus and anterior temporal lobes [ ]. 

Postlexical output is the production stage, in which phonological representations are mapped to motor representations and speech occurs. Some dual-stream models assign this stage to the dorsal stream, in that the phonological representations in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) are mapped to motor sequence representations in the temporoparietal junction and posterior inferior frontal lobes [ ]. 


### 1.3. Design of This Experiment 
  
We tested these three predictions of the interhemispheric inhibition model in a cross-sectional study of people with chronic aphasia following left hemisphere stroke. The experiment used an fMRI task to isolate covert (phonological retrieval) and overt (postlexical output) phases of picture naming; we first examined the general patterns of activity in our aphasia group compared to matched controls and the relationship between activity and overall lesion size. We then used the activity in the control group to define the normal brain network for naming in older people without language impairment or brain injury and tested how lesions at key nodes in this network affected activity throughout the rest of the brain, in particular within the remaining bilateral language sites. The goal of the study was to examine whether plastic changes in chronic aphasia would be related to the size and site of the lesion, with particular interest in right hemisphere plasticity occurring in regions that were homotopic to the left hemisphere lesions. We further tested whether any changes in activity associated with lesion site were related to naming performance, in order to assess whether these regions are successfully adapting to support language function or are inhibiting successful recovery. 



## 2. Materials and Methods 
  
### 2.1. Participants 
  
Forty-nine chronic left hemisphere stroke survivors with a history of aphasia were recruited. Ten participants were then excluded based on fMRI task performance (<10% accuracy) resulting in a final sample of 39 participants in the aphasia group. 

All participants in the aphasia group were native English speakers and testing occurred at least six months after their stroke (mean chronicity = 52.9 months). Participants were screened based on ability to follow testing instructions and had no history of other significant neurological illnesses. The distribution of lesions and individual demographic information for the aphasia group can be found in the Supplementary Material available online at  . 

Thirty-seven healthy control subjects, with no neurologic or psychiatric disorders, were also tested. Participants in the control group were matched to the aphasia group on age (  t  (67.5) = −0.42,   P   > 0.60), sex (  χ  (1) = 0.79,   P   > 0.30), education (  t  (73.0) = 0.85,   P   > 0.30), and handedness (  χ  (3) = 3.1,   P   > 0.30). Group means can be found in  . 

The study was approved by the Georgetown University Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants prior to enrollment in the study. 


### 2.2. Experimental Design 
  
Visual stimuli consisted of 54 line drawings, with 92–100% name agreement based on norming in an independent sample of 55 older controls, representing one-, two-, and three-syllable words. To reduce individual differences in in-scanner performance, participants were presented with one of two 32-item sets during scanning based on the severity of their deficits. Fourteen participants whose naming and repetition deficits were severe in pre-MRI testing were given 32 one- and two-syllable items, while all other participants, including controls, were given 32 two- and three-syllable items during scanning. The one-syllable words also had overall higher frequency than the three-syllable words. 

The fMRI task followed a slow jittered event related design. The trials were presented in a pseudo-randomized order. The task was a delayed naming task, which allows for the independent analysis of name retrieval and name production [ ]. First, a single line drawing appeared centered on the screen, surrounded by a red border. This image remained on the screen for 7500–9000 ms, during which time the participant named the object in the image silently (covert naming). Then, the border around the image changed from red to green and remained on screen for 5500 ms. During this time, the participant was asked to produce the name of the object aloud (overt naming). Finally, the line drawing and the surrounding box disappeared and the participant fixated on a crosshair for 14000 ms. A slow event related design was chosen to allow for wash out of the hemodynamic response, which may be slower in stroke survivors [ ]. Images were presented using E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburg, PA), and responses were recorded using a MRI safe microphone (Opto-acoustics, FOMRI-III). Before the scan, participants practiced the task on images not included in the fMRI task. If a participant produced the correct name at any point during the overt naming period, the item was counted as correct. Only trials in which the correct response was produced during the overt phase were included in the analysis. If a participant made an incorrect or no response during the overt naming phase of the trial, the entire trial (both covert and overt phases) was removed from further analysis. 

Naming ability was tested using a 60-item version of the Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT) [ ], made up of items independent of those used in the scanning task. Testing took place within one week of the MRI scan. We counted the total number of items on the PNT that were named correctly on the first attempt. 


### 2.3. Scanning Parameters and Preprocessing 
  
MRI data were collected on a 3.0 T Siemens Trio Scanner at the Georgetown University Medical Center. A high resolution T1-weighted MPRAGE was collected with the following parameters: repetition time = 1900 ms, echo time = 2.56 ms, flip angle = 9°, 160 contiguous 1 mm slices, field of view = 250 × 250 mm, matrix size = 246 × 256, and voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm. Functional T2 -weighted images were acquired using a gradient-echo echo-planar pulse sequence, with the following parameters: repetition time = 2000 ms, echo time = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, 38 contiguous 3.2 mm slices, field of view = 250 × 250 mm, and voxel size = 3.2 × 3.2 × 3.2 mm. The functional scan consisted of 32 trials, including an opening and closing screen, totaling approximately 15 minutes. 

Lesion masks were created by manually tracing stroke damage on the T1-weighted images, in native space, in MRIcron [ ], following a preestablished set of guidelines for determining lesion borders. Ventricular expansion was not included in the lesion. All lesion masks were checked by two board certified neurologists (Shihui Xing and Peter E. Turkeltaub) after the tracing and again after the lesion masks were warped to the template. 

fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using FSL 5.0.6 [ ]. Preprocessing included application of a high pass temporal filter, standard correction for head motion using MCFLIRT, interleaved slice timing correction, intensity normalization across volumes, and spatial smoothing to 5 mm FWHM. Registration and normalization were carried out to the MNI standardized brain provided by FSL. For each condition in each trial, a canonical double-gamma hemodynamic response function was constructed for the duration of the event. Motion parameters were then included as covariates in the model. 


### 2.4. fMRI Analysis 
  
First, we examined where participants in the aphasia group over- and underactivated relative to controls during covert and overt naming. In between-group contrasts, only areas that were significantly active (  z   > 2.3) in the aphasia group were included in the aphasia > control contrast, and vice versa. All whole-brain analyses were examined at cluster corrected   P   < 0.01, after a grey matter mask was applied. 

#### 2.4.1. Effects of Lesion Volume on Activity 
  
We tested whether right hemisphere activity in people with aphasia is driven by the extent of overall damage in the left hemisphere. To do this, we quantified the size of the lesion, warped to template, for each individual. Lesion size was measured in mm  after warping to a standardized template and then entered as a voxelwise continuous predictor variable in a group analysis. Clusters identified as significant in this analysis are areas where activation, for either covert or overt naming, differed as a function of lesion size. 


#### 2.4.2. Regions of Interest Used to Examine Remapping 
  
In order to examine how lesions within the normal language network affect naming ability, we identified regions of interest (ROIs) using the within-group contrasts from the control group. The peak voxel in each active cluster was identified, excluding primary visual cortex, for both the covert > fixation and overt > fixation contrasts. Then, 5 mm spheres were drawn around the peak voxel. 

For each of the left hemisphere ROIs, aphasia group participants were grouped based on lesion status at the ROI. As these were very small ROIs, not large clusters, the distributions of percent lesions in the ROIs were highly bimodal, so an all or nothing approach was used: If a participant had a lesion that overlapped with the ROI in even one voxel, the participant was counted in the “lesion” group for that ROI. Then we tested whether lesions at each left hemisphere site led to worse naming performance on the PNT. Whole-brain analyses were then carried out, contrasting activity in these two groups (lesion versus intact at ROI site) of people with aphasia, while controlling for overall lesion volume. 

Finally, we examined more closely the relationships between damage in sites normally active in controls and activity in the remaining nodes in the network. Regressions were carried out which tested whether lesion status in a left hemisphere ROI predicted activity levels in each of the other left and right hemisphere ROIs, controlling for lesion volume. ROIs in which activity was modulated by lesion status at another site were then further tested to see whether activity in that area related to naming ability. 




## 3. Results 
  
### 3.1. Whole-Brain Activity during Covert and Overt Naming 
  
In the covert > fixation contrast ( , Figures  - ), the aphasia group showed greater activity than the control group mostly in bilateral basal ganglia, bilateral cerebellum, but also the right ventral central sulcus and right IFG. The aphasia group underactivated the left frontal pole, cingulate cortex, and bilateral clusters in the superior frontal gyrus compared to controls. In within-group contrasts, both groups showed significant activation in the visual cortex. The control group showed bilateral activation in the inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), while the aphasia group only showed significant activation in the right IPS. Likewise, the control group showed activation in the bilateral insula and pars opercularis (POp), as well as left PTr, while the aphasia group only activated the right PTr. 

During overt naming ( , Figures  - ), the aphasia group overactivated dorsal regions bilaterally, in particular bilateral central sulcus, as well as right insula, right angular gyrus, and right Heschl's gyrus. The aphasia group underactivated, relative to controls, the left IFG, insula, superior temporal gyrus (STG), and cerebellum. In the within-group contrasts, both the aphasia group and control group activated the right superior temporal sulcus (STS), STG, temporal pole, and central sulcus. Only the control group activated these regions in the left hemisphere, while only the aphasia group showed activity in the right IFG. 


### 3.2. Effect of Lesion Size on Activity 
  
Next, we looked for regions, within the aphasia group, where activity during covert and overt naming was predicted by large lesions ( ,  ). During covert naming, larger lesion size predicted widespread right hemisphere activity, especially in the central sulcus, POp, and PTr, but also in bilateral visual cortex, cingulate, IPS, and basal ganglia. During overt naming, larger lesion size predicted activation in bilateral central sulcus, cingulate, and cerebellum, but activity was heavily right lateralized, especially in right PTr, posterior STS, and posterior STG. 

We also looked for regions where activity was greater in participants with smaller lesions. There were no areas where activity was significantly predicted by smaller lesions at our threshold. 


### 3.3. Lesions at ROIs and Behavior 
  
Regions of interest were drawn based on peaks from the control group maps ( ). For covert naming, ROIs included the left and right IPS, left and right insula, and a left dorsal POp peak. Another peak in the left cingulate met requirements for an ROI, but only one participant in the aphasia group had a lesion in this area, so it was removed from further analysis. For overt naming, ROIs were selected in both the left and right motor cortex and STS. 

We then tested whether lesion statuses in the left ROIs were related to naming performance in the scanner, using linear regression. Lesions in the left insula were related to worse naming,   t  (37) = −2.4,   P   < 0.05, but this effect did not hold when lesion size was introduced as a control variable,   P   > 0.30. Lesions in the left insula, dorsal POp, motor cortex, and STS had no relationship with naming performance in the scanner. 


### 3.4. Effect of Lesion Location on Remapping and Whole-Brain Analysis 
  
We then carried out whole-volume analysis using the aphasia group, testing whether lesion status at each left hemisphere ROI resulted in different patterns of activity in the rest of the brain, with lesion volume added as a nuisance variable. For covert naming, at a cluster corrected   P   < 0.01, there was no difference between people with left IPS lesions versus those without lesions at the IPS site. 

People with left insula lesions showed less activity in the right middle and inferior frontal gyri, with peaks in the right middle frontal gyrus and right dorsal PTr. Participants with left POp lesions also showed less activation in nearly overlapping regions, including right dorsal POp ( ,  ). The similarity of these results is likely due to the significant overlap between participants with left insula lesions and participants with left POp lesions. 

We then took the cortical peak in this right hemisphere cluster, located in dorsal PTr, and extracted the activation levels for covert naming relative to baseline. The activation level in each participant with aphasia was transformed into a   z  -score centered on the control group mean. We carried out two tests, to examine whether activity in this area was related to PNT score, in the group with left POp lesions (  N   = 16) and in the group with intact left POp (  N   = 23), again controlling lesion size. There was no significant relationship between activity in the right peak activation and naming in either group (both   P  's > 0.25). The same analyses were also done, dividing participants based on lesion status at left insula (intact   N   = 21, lesion   N   = 18), but again no relationship was found for either group (both   P  's > 0.80). 

No group differences in activity in the whole-volume analysis were identified based on lesion status at the two left hemisphere overt naming ROIs, left motor cortex and left STS, at this threshold. 


### 3.5. Effect of Lesion Status in One ROI on Activity in Other ROIs 
  
Finally, we tested whether lesion status in each left hemisphere ROI affected activity levels in all other, left and right hemisphere, ROIs derived from the healthy control sample, controlling for lesion size. 

For covert naming, only one relationship was marginally significant. Participants with left insula lesions had marginally greater activity in the left POp, but this effect was unreliable at   P   = 0.07. 

For overt naming, lesions in the left motor cortex were related to significantly greater activity in the right motor cortex,   t  (36) = 2.91,   P   < 0.01, while lesions in the left STS were associated with lower activity in right motor cortex,   t  (36) = −2.24,   P   < 0.05 ( ). 

We then tested whether right motor cortex over- or underactivation predicted naming performance in people with and without left motor lesions. As with the IFG analysis above, we calculated   z  -scores for activity in participants with aphasia, centered on the control group mean. For participants in the aphasia group with intact left motor cortex (  N   = 15), there was no relationship between right motor activity and naming,   t  (12) = −0.28,   P   = 0.75. However, for participants with left motor lesions (  N   = 24), right motor activity was positively associated with naming,   t  (21) = 3.67,   P   = 0.001. 



## 4. General Discussion 
  
This study addressed the relationship between stroke distribution and naming activity in chronic left hemisphere stroke survivors. Specifically, we examined whether overall size of the lesion, and damage of different nodes in the normal naming network, results in different patterns of brain activity. The analysis approach allowed us to test several current hypotheses regarding poststroke plasticity in language networks. Overall, the results support the prevalent notion that larger strokes result in greater usage of right hemisphere areas and further demonstrate that damage to different left hemisphere language nodes results in different patterns of activity in surviving nodes. The specific results, however, present challenges for the interhemispheric inhibition model and suggest that other mechanisms of behavioral and biological plasticity might better account for the data. 

### 4.1. Residual Left Hemisphere Language Activity and Perilesional Recruitment 
  
A striking finding from the overall group analysis was a failure of people with aphasia to activate normal left hemisphere brain areas associated with speech production, including the ventral sensorimotor cortex and the superior temporal cortex [ ], during overt naming. These areas were robustly activated by the control group but not the group with aphasia, a difference confirmed in the direct between-group comparison. This finding cannot be related to direct lesion damage to these areas, as lesioned voxels were excluded from the analysis on a person-by-person basis. Rather, this pattern suggests a failure to activate spared left hemisphere speech production areas due to lesions elsewhere in the network. This explanation was not clearly supported by the ROI analysis, however, in which lesions in left hemisphere overt naming nodes did not relate to decreased activity in other spared left hemisphere nodes. Of note, because the ROIs were based on peak locations of activity in the control group, they were all located in the grey matter. It is possible the decreased activity observed in normal left hemisphere speech areas was primarily driven by disconnection from other network nodes due to white matter damage, which was not examined here. Regardless, the failure to activate normal left hemisphere areas involved in naming begs the question of whether and where compensation might be occurring in spared brain areas. 

One prominent idea regarding poststroke language network plasticity proposes that left hemisphere perilesional areas surrounding the stroke that were previously involved in other functions are recruited into the language network to compensate for loss of language nodes [ ]. In our voxelwise analysis, we found only weak evidence for these effects, with small areas of increased activity relative to controls in left dorsal frontal cortex during overt naming. We note that the analysis may not have been sensitive to these effects due to variability in stroke distributions. In the more sensitive ROI analysis, we found that lesions in the left insula were associated with marginally higher covert naming activity levels in the left dorsal POp, but this effect was weak and difficult to interpret given how few of our participants had one of these nodes lesioned and the other intact. Overall, this study provides little evidence either for or against perilesional compensation. 


### 4.2. Lesion Size and Right Hemisphere Recruitment 
  
Another prominent mode of proposed reorganization after stroke is the recruitment of homotopic areas in the right hemisphere. It has frequently been suggested that overall lesion size in the left hemisphere may relate to right hemisphere recruitment [ ,  ,  ]. This proposed relationship is sometimes based on the interhemispheric inhibition model, even though a relationship between lesion size and contralesional recruitment is not supported by animal models, in which small sensorimotor lesions result in an increase in synaptogenesis and astrocytic volume contralateral to the stroke, while large lesions result in decreases in both of these measures, likely due to denervation-induced atrophy [ ]. Alternatively, the proposed relationship between lesion size and right hemisphere engagement is sometimes based on the logical argument that people with relatively small lesions have sufficient viable left hemisphere tissue to support language and may not require right hemisphere compensation, whereas people with large lesions have little viable left hemisphere tissue and must rely on the right hemisphere to a greater extent. Although a positive relationship between lesion size and right hemisphere recruitment is frequently discussed in the literature, there is surprisingly little direct empirical evidence of this relationship. One prior study examined the laterality indices of eight people with aphasia and found that large lesions were associated with greater right than left hemisphere activation during picture naming but not during a semantic decision task [ ]. Here, we present strong support for this effect in both covert and overt naming in a large sample. Participants with larger lesions showed greater activity in right hemisphere areas homotopic to the normal left hemisphere language network. Notably, for overt naming, the specific pattern of activity related to lesion size in the right hemisphere ( ) closely mirrored the pattern of decreased activity relative to controls in the left hemisphere ( ). 

The mechanisms underlying the increased activation of the right hemisphere in people with large lesions are unclear. This effect may not reflect plasticity at all but rather the increased effort required for language tasks by people with larger lesions. It is not unusual for more difficult tasks to elicit greater activity throughout the brain, including homotopic right hemisphere areas for language tasks [ ]. Participants with large lesions likely exert greater effort in retrieving and producing the names of items and thus show overactivation during the task. Notably, activity in the bilateral visual cortex was also related to lesion size during both covert and overt naming here, suggesting that greater activity in general may be related to greater effort and longer looking times. Like other recent studies, we restricted our analysis to correct trials only in part to minimize these effort effects. However, even when producing a correct naming response, it is likely the people with large lesions may expend more effort than those with small lesions. 

Similarly, it has recently been proposed that some right hemisphere overactivation observed in aphasia could be explained by recruitment of domain general attentional systems [ ,  ] rather than language system reorganization per se. As above, the right hemisphere activity may similarly relate to the overall greater difficulty of language tasks for people with aphasia, although, under this hypothesis, the right hemisphere activity does not contribute to computations specific to language at all. Although this may explain part of the effect, we think it is unlikely to explain all right hemisphere overactivation in aphasia, given evidence here and elsewhere that activation of some right hemisphere nodes relates to the location of damage in the left and that the tasks that activate specific right hemisphere nodes are the same as those that activate the homotopic left hemisphere nodes in healthy controls [ ]. 

Alternatively, explicit or implicit strategies used to compensate for deficits may result in recruitment of brain networks not used by healthy controls for language tasks, including the right hemisphere. As in the proposed overreliance on domain general systems, activity related to use of these strategies during scanning would not reflect any true plasticity in the language network. However, ultimately, reliance on domain general resources or alternate strategies in the long term could reinforce new neuronal connections and result in permanent neuroplastic changes in the network. In this case, differential activity could be observed even if the person does not actively use any alternate strategies during scanning. Melodic intonation therapy provides a clear example of an explicit compensatory strategy that can induce long lasting changes in network structure [ ]. However, compensatory strategies need not be directly related to specific therapeutic experiences. For instance, a person who fails to retrieve the phonology of a word may attempt to visualize its spelling without any therapeutic training to do so. Changes in brain organization related to these type of strategic shifts may or may not relate to lesion size and location. For example, compensatory strategies involving pragmatic aspects of language or alternate forms of communication might be most used by people with large lesions and severe aphasia, potentially resulting in a relationship between lesion size and remodeling in brain areas involved in these functions. In the example of melodic intonation therapy, people with large frontal lesions causing nonfluent aphasias are most likely to receive this type of treatment [ ], so this bias in exposure to intonation-based treatment could result in a relationship between left frontal strokes and right hemisphere changes that are behaviorally, rather than neurobiologically, driven. Spontaneous strategies such as mental visualization of word spellings could similarly relate to lesion location, assuming specific stroke distributions give rise to a pattern of deficits and preserved abilities that make these strategies advantageous. Importantly, however, reorganization related to strategic shifts should not necessarily occur in areas that are homotopic to the lesion. 


### 4.3. Remapping in Homotopic Nodes 
  
In contrast to the types of behaviorally driven plasticity described above, some neuroplasticity after stroke may occur as a direct biological result of the stroke itself. The interhemispheric inhibition model is the most prominent theory of biologically driven plasticity in the intact hemisphere after stroke. One prediction of this model is that remapping into the right hemisphere in aphasia should be homotopic to the lesion and not only driven by an overall lack of remaining left hemisphere tissue. A second predication is that as right hemisphere regions inhibit the remaining left hemisphere tissue, activity in the right should be associated with worse performance. 

Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that lesions in the left POp and insula led to robustly decreased covert naming activity in the right PTr and in the MFG just dorsal to the POp, even when controlling for lesion volume. Furthermore, activity in this right frontal region was not related to naming ability. This finding also stands in contrast to a recent meta-analysis showing, across many studies using various language tasks, people with left IFG lesions were more likely to activate the right IFG [ ]. There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the right hemisphere activity here is not perfectly homotopic with the lesioned nodes, although the difference in location, compared to the dorsal POp node, is very small. Second, we did not account for the proportion of the region affected by stroke. Greater right IFG activity might be more likely in people with a greater proportion of the left IFG damaged, while we treated all participants with lesions at the left insula (or POp) site as one group. However, a recent study using a semantic task found no relationship between proportion of intact left IFG and right IFG activity [ ], and as noted above, the animal literature shows that larger lesions can be associated with atrophy of contralateral cortex, rather than enhanced plasticity [ ], corresponding with our findings here. Second, our study controlled for total lesion volume, which is rarely done in fMRI studies of aphasia, particularly in case studies or case series with few participants. It is likely that increased right IFG activity in prior studies is related to large lesions that include the left IFG and not specifically to lesions in the left IFG themselves. In support of this explanation,   demonstrates that increased total lesion volume is associated with increased right IFG activity, among other areas. Finally, our study excluded participants with severe anomia, who could not correctly name at least 10% of the trials in the scanner. Other studies involving more severe patients, especially those that do not isolate activity related exclusively to correct trials, might reasonably produce a different result in the IFG. Therefore, questions for future study include whether homotopic remapping in the inferior frontal lobes is more likely in people with more severe aphasia and is related primarily to erroneous responses, as has previously been suggested in a small case series [ ]. 

We did find evidence for homotopic remapping in motor cortex, in that left motor cortex lesions led to significantly greater right motor cortex activation during overt naming, controlling for total lesion volume. However, in contrast to the predictions of the interhemispheric inhibition model, overactivation of right motor cortex was associated with better naming performance in people with left motor lesions. These results join a growing body of literature suggesting that the right hemisphere may play a largely compensatory role, even in chronic stages of aphasia. Evidence for this begins in neuropsychological case studies, which have identified people who had recovered at least partially from aphasia following left hemisphere stroke and then redeveloped aphasia after a later right hemisphere disruption, whether due to intracarotid amobarbital injection or a second stroke [ – ]. These studies suggest that the right hemisphere can, to some degree, take over the language functions that the left hemisphere can no longer perform. A recent structural study found that greater grey matter volume in the right temporoparietal cortex related to better language production outcomes in chronic aphasia [ ]. Other neuroimaging studies have shown positive relationships between right hemisphere activation and various language outcomes, supporting right hemisphere compensation [ – ]. Based on performance decrements after inhibitory TMS, other studies have also suggested that right hemisphere areas may be involved to some degree in phonology and naming in healthy people [ ,  ]. Damage to left hemisphere language nodes may thus result in increased reliance on these right hemisphere language processors [ ]. However, this explanation cannot account for the effects observed here, since the activity in right motor cortex related to naming performance only in people with left motor cortex lesions. This pattern strongly suggests a true compensatory relationship in which the right hemisphere node “takes over” for the corresponding lesioned left hemisphere area and demonstrates that specific biological mechanisms of plasticity beyond the interhemispheric inhibition model must be considered. 


### 4.4. Alternate Biological Mechanisms of Right Hemisphere Recruitment 
  
If not interhemispheric inhibition, what biological mechanism might explain recruitment of a homotopic node in the right hemisphere? The first possibility is that the interhemispheric inhibition hypothesis may be partially correct. It is possible that right hemisphere homotopic recruitment does result from transcallosal disinhibition but that this overactivation does not significantly suppress the surviving left hemisphere tissue. Behaviorally important right-to-left inhibition may simply never occur in language systems, may be restricted to particular areas such as the PTr, or may occur only in the case of relatively small lesions with some nearly homotopic left hemisphere tissue remaining to be inhibited [ ]. 

However, other biological mechanisms might better explain compensatory recruitment of homotopic areas in the spared hemisphere after stroke. It has previously been noted that right hemisphere activity is maximal several weeks after a stroke causing aphasia [ ]. If this activity resulted from direct disinhibition, the right hemisphere activity should occur immediately after the stroke. This kind of immediate right hemisphere recruitment has been observed after TMS-induced transient lesions [ ,  ], but not after stroke. The gradual development of right hemisphere activation after stroke instead suggests a slower process, possibly relying on structural plasticity rather than a direct electrophysiological effect. 

We suggest that axonal collateral sprouting from surviving neurons may provide an alternative neurobiological mechanism to explain both perilesional left hemisphere and homotopic right hemisphere recruitment in aphasia. This model is based on the principle that if two neurons send axons to the same target, they compete for synapses at the target. If one neuron dies, its axon degenerates and the surviving neuron's axon sprouts new collaterals near the target to take over empty synapses. Axonal collateral sprouting is observed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, for instance, in the development of ocular dominance columns and the delineation of motor units at the neuromuscular junction. It is known to play a role in reorganization after spinal cord injury [ ] and brain injury, including stroke [ ]. Competition has been shown to guide axonal sprouting in the sensory-motor spinal circuits in adult rats [ ], and unbalanced endogenous activity dramatically affects receptor targeting in tracts crossing the corpus callosum [ ]. Although not the only mechanism that can explain “take over” of prior functions by new brain areas, axonal collateral sprouting has previously been demonstrated to account for this phenomenon. For example, when dorsal route fibers to the hippocampus are destroyed in rats, ventral route fibers take over these connections over a period of months resulting in ultimate recovery of innervation patterns [ ]. Further, axonal collateral sprouting is altered by the experience of the organism [ ], providing a specific biological mechanism for function and neuroanatomic changes induced by speech-language therapy in people with aphasia. 

Under this hypothesis, spared brain regions that share axonal targets with the lesioned tissue are the most likely to be recruited after stroke. This suggests that areas engaged to compensate might be predictable based on coconnectivity patterns before the stroke. Neighboring neurons are likely to share axonal targets, thus providing a basis for perilesional recruitment in the case of relatively small lesions. In some cases, such as motor areas innervating proximal limb muscles and the tongue, the homotopic cortex in the intact hemisphere likely shares axonal projection targets with the lesioned neurons and can take over the lost synapses, resulting in functional recovery [ ,  ]. 

Our findings were near the mouth areas of motor cortex, and this mechanism might explain our findings of right hemisphere mouth-area motor recruitment during overt but not covert naming, corresponding with better naming performance specifically when the left hemisphere mouth area of motor cortex is lesioned. However, motor cortex has also been shown in other neuroimaging studies to play a role in covert naming and prearticulatory processes [ ]. Furthermore, Geranmayeh and colleagues have argued that, regardless of the role of motor cortex in healthy people, upregulation of the region in people with aphasia is a marker of increased demands on domain general systems such as cognitive control and attention [ ], and the relationship between activity and recovery is more related to those processes than anything language specific. It is possible that the diverse, nonspecific role of the motor cortex in speech production may also prime it to be uniquely plastic and available for taking over cognitive function through axonal sprouting, when the homotopic region is lesioned. 

Regardless of the specific role of each region, the broader pattern of right hemisphere recruitment may result from a cascading effect from one homotopic right hemisphere node taking over synapses from its left hemisphere counterpart at a shared axonal target. When this node takes over the function of the lesioned left hemisphere node, the entire right hemisphere network connected to this one node may become involved in compensation, at least to a degree, resulting in broad patterns of increased activity. Alternatively, homotopic areas of each hemisphere's association cortices may share common cortical and subcortical axonal projection targets, and synaptic competition may account directly for broad patterns of right hemisphere recruitment. Modern connectomics may help to test these ideas. If supported by additional data, this hypothesis may provide clear predictions regarding the availability and location of alternate processing nodes based on the specific anatomical structures damaged by an individual's stroke. 


### 4.5. Limitations and Future Directions 
  
One unexpected finding was that while both people with aphasia and controls showed widespread activity during both covert and overt naming, the differences between the two groups was more widespread during overt naming. Most strikingly, the temporal lobe, in particular the STS and STG, was not significantly active in either group during covert naming. The posterior STS and STG are involved in phonological processes, which can include phonological retrieval [ ], verbal working memory [ ], and a sensorimotor speech interface for speech productions [ ], so it was expected to be active during the covert naming phase of the experiment. In our experiment, however, no response was collected during the covert naming phase. If a trial was answered incorrectly during overt naming, both the covert and overt naming phases were removed from analysis. But, we do not have any measurable evidence of what was occurring for each participant during the covert naming phase. It is possible that some participants were less engaged in the task and only really attempted to name the object when cued to make an overt response and thus did not activate articulatory regions during the covert naming phase. In general, the use of a low-level control condition in the fMRI task allowed us to identify activity for word retrieval and production broadly but prohibited a detailed accounting of the precise nature of the processing in any given area of activity. 

In this study, we identified regions where plasticity was dependent on the site of the lesion in left frontal and motor tissue. However, it remains unclear whether these relationships are mediated by the degree to which critical areas for naming are damaged or preserved. The language network in the left hemisphere involves many regions which are critical for different aspects of language. The degree to which a critical area for naming is destroyed by the stroke may determine whether plasticity of naming function is even possible, regardless of the lesion status at other regions of interest such as motor or inferior frontal cortex. A goal of future research is to identify regions in which damage has a catastrophic effect on naming ability and then model how damage in these regions affects others in the system, both perilesional and homotopic. 



## 5. Conclusions 
  
In this study we tested three central hypotheses of the interhemispheric inhibition model. We found an overall greater rightward shift of activity dependent on lesion size. Taking this overall effect into account, specific patterns of right hemisphere plasticity depended on the specific location of the stroke. Furthermore, right motor activation was positively associated with naming ability but only in people with left motor lesions. This finding suggests that lesion site needs to be accounted for when considering both the cause of right hemisphere overactivation and the role of right hemisphere activity, in people with aphasia. It is unlikely that any single biological mechanism explains all aspects of poststroke reorganization, and as noted above, complex interactions between biology and the environment are expected. We suggest that future work on aphasia recovery should be guided by specific behavioral and biological hypotheses that lead to specific experimental predictions for brain imaging and stimulation studies. Interhemispheric inhibition is one such specific biological hypothesis, but it cannot account for the entire range of observed neuroplastic effects in aphasia. The field must begin to entertain equally specific alternate hypotheses, such as synaptic competition, in order to move forward.

# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
Several studies have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show that neural activity is associated with driving. fMRI studies have also elucidated the brain responses associated with driving while performing sub-tasks. It is important to note that these studies used computer mouses, trackballs, or joysticks to simulate driving and, thus, were not comparable to real driving situations. In order to overcome these limitations, we used a driving wheel and pedal equipped with an MR-compatible driving simulator (80 km/h). The subjects drove while performing sub-tasks, and we attempted to observe differences in neuronal activation. 


## Methods 
  
The experiments consisted of three blocks and each block consisted of both a control phase (1 min) and a driving phase (2 min). During the control phase, the drivers were instructed to look at the stop screen and to not perform driving tasks. During the driving phase, the drivers either drove (driving only condition) or drove while performing an additional sub-task (driving with sub-task condition) at 80 km/h. 


## Results 
  
Compared to when the drivers were focused only on driving, when the drivers drove while performing a sub-task, the number of activation voxels greatly decreased in the parietal area, which is responsible for spatial perception. Task-performing areas, such as the inferior frontal gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus, showed increased activation. Performing a sub-task simultaneously while driving had affected the driver’s driving. The cingulate gyrus and the sub-lobar region (lentiform nucleus, caudate, insula, and thalamus), which are responsible for error monitoring and control of unnecessary movements (e.g., wheel and pedal movements), showed increased activation during driving with sub-task condition compared to driving only condition. 


## Conclusions 
  
Unlike simple driving simulators (joysticks, computer mouses, or trackballs) used in previous research, the addition of a driving wheel and pedals (accelerator and brake) to the driving simulator used in this study closely represents real driving. Thus, the number of processed movements was increased, which led to an increased number of unnecessary movements that needed to be controlled. This in turn increased activation in the corresponding brain regions. 

 

# Body
 
## Background 
  
Driving is a complex multitasking activity that involves perception, attention, decision-making, sensory, motor, and higher-level cognitive components [ ,  ]. Recent studies on complex multitasking (driving)-related neural correlates have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study its neurophysiological aspects [ – ]. In previous studies, driving was simulated by using a joystick, computer mouse, or a trackball. They revealed the activation of the following regions: the parietal lobe and precuneus region (spatial perception), the precentral gyrus and frontal eye field regions (motor response, arm and eye movement) [ ,  ], the supplementary motor area (SMA) and cerebellum region (motor control and action planning) [ ,  ,  ,  – ], and the cingulate gyrus region (attention and error monitoring) [ ,  ,  ,  ]. 

Recently, the increase in electronic device use has resulted in the performance of frequent sub-tasks during driving. Sub-tasks can be defined as radio tuning, dialing a cell phone, eating, or carrying on a conversation. These sub-tasks are reported to decrease driving performance (brake response time, tracking performance, speed control, car following, and lane keeping) measured using physiological assessments [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Safe driving requires the ability to concentrate, to divide one’s attention between multiple sensory events across visual and auditory modalities, and to make fast cognitive decisions in a complex and rapidly changing environment. Neuroimaging studies of neurophysiological variables have also elucidated the neural substrates involved during driving while performing sub-tasks such as conversation, auditory language comprehension, and visual event detection [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. 

Several studies have been carried out to observe the changes in brain activation related to visual cognition [ – ], spatial attention or vigilance [ ,  ], and motor function [ ] while driving and performing sub-tasks simultaneously. It is reported that when performing driving and sub-tasks simultaneously, the activation of the parietal and occipital areas related to driving is reduced [ ,  ,  ,  ]. It is also reported that when performing driving and sub-tasks simultaneously, the activation of the precentral gyrus, the frontal and parietal lobes, and cingulate gyrus areas related to attention, stimulus processing, motor responses, and decision-making is increased [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. When performing driving and sub-tasks simultaneously, motor areas have decreased activation while the activation of areas related to sub-tasks, such as motor control and attention areas, is increased [ ,  ,  ,  ]. 

However, the above studies were not realistic because the subjects performed the driving task using a joystick, computer mouses, or trackball with one hand in the simulated driving conditions (e.g., video game and driving simulator). In fact, driving is performed using a wheel (handle) and pedals. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the regions of the brain that are activated during the various cognitive activities required in actual driving using the systems used in previous studies. For this reason, some previous studies have attempted to simulate driving in a real driving environment by using a wheel and pedals. When using a computer mouse or a trackball to simulate driving and the sub-tasks simultaneously, fine control is actually worse than when a wheel and pedal is used in actual driving. For example, one can more accurately maintain a lane when controlling a wheel with both hands than when using a computer mouse or a trackball. In addition, one can more accurately control speed using the brake and one can more accurately control acceleration using the right foot than when using a computer mouse and a trackball. We, therefore, performed simulated driving in our study using a wheel and pedals to more accurately simulate driving control and the brain activation patterns present in an actual driving environment. 

In order to overcome the limitations of previous studies, we used an MR-compatible driving simulator with a driving wheel and pedals in order to observe the effects of sub-tasks on driving. Our objective was to observe differences in activated brain regions using neurophysiological assessments during driving alone and when sub-tasks were performed during driving. Our working hypotheses were as follows. First, it is expected that the activation of the parietal area, which is the spatial perception-related area, will decrease and that the activation of areas related to sub-task performance will increase when performing driving and the sub-task simultaneously compared to driving only. Second, when performing driving and the sub-tasks simultaneously, the sub-tasks will affect driving. Therefore, the activation of areas related to behavior and motions used to control driving are expected to increase. Third, as previous studies simulated driving by using one hand (computer mouse, trackball, etc.), while this study used a wheel controlled with both hands and pedals controlled with the right foot, an additional area related to these actions is expected to be activated. 


## Methods 
  
Using the MR-compatible driving simulator for cases in which the driver only drives at 80 km/h (driving only), those in which the driver only performs the sub-task (task only), and those in which the driver performs the sub-task while driving at 80 km/h (driving with task), the research team designed a method to observe the brain using fMRI. In order to do this, we used subtraction and double subtraction methods. 

### Subjects 
  
Fifteen men with a driving experience of 2.5 ± 1.6 years and without any psychiatric illness or nerve/brain-related conditions were selected. Their average age was 26.0 ± 1.4 years. All subjects were right-handed as evaluated using the revised Edinburgh test [ ]. Any subjects who might have had claustrophobia, pacemakers, or metal embedded in their bodies, which would have affected MR imaging, were excluded from the selection process. Prior to the experiment, all participants were prohibited from smoking, drinking alcohol/coffee, or any external activity that could impair their driving. The experiment was then explained to them. The subjects were required to practice in the simulation environment with the simulator until they could drive normally without crashing. The protocol for the research project was approved by the Institutional Review Committee of Konkuk University, where the work was undertaken. Our research protocol also conforms to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki (KU-IRB-11-46-A-1). 


### MR-compatible driving simulator 
  
The research team developed an MR-compatible driving simulator with a driving wheel and pedals, as seen in Fig.  . The simple driving environment was produced using software provided by Lightrock Entertainment, and was made up of mostly straight roadways with very few elements that could distract the driver (Fig.  ). The subjects used both hands to operate the wheel and their right foot to control the accelerator and the brake. They drove at a constant 80 km/h without changing road lanes. Generally, in Korea, the speed limits on the roads are in accordance with Article 19 of “Road Traffic Act enforcement regulations” (speed of cars, etc.) and the highest speed limit on general roads with two or more one-way lanes (all roads other than highways and motorways) is less than 80 km/h. In consideration of safety and accessibility when preparing the test video, this study used general roads of two or more one-way lanes as the video, which was presented at a simulated speed of 80 km/h, which is the regulated speed limit on general roads. The visual information for driving was displayed on a visual system attached to the subjects’ head coil. Fig.   shows the preparation before the beginning of the experiment.

### Experimental design 
  
The experiment was performed using three conditions. Each condition consisted of three same blocks and every block has a control phase (1 min) and a condition phase (2 min). The first condition is when only driving is performed. In this condition, one block consists of a control phase (1 min) and a driving only condition (2 min) (Fig.  ). The second condition is when driving and a sub-task are performed simultaneously. In this condition, one block consists of a control phase (1 min) and a driving with sub-task condition (2 min) (Fig.  ). The third condition is when only a sub-task is performed. In this condition, one block consists of a control phase (1 min) and a sub-task only condition (2 min) (Fig.  ). Commonly, during the control phase, the drivers were instructed to simply look at the screen, which showed a parked, non-moving state. During the driving only condition, the subjects were asked to only drive at 80 km/h. During the driving with sub-task condition, the drivers were asked to drive at 80 km/h while performing a sub-task. Finally, all subjects were asked to only perform a sub-task under identical conditions during the sub-task only condition. Each subject participated in the above three conditions (driving only, driving with sub-task, and sub-task only conditions). Once the first experiment was concluded, the subjects were all provided with plenty of resting time (approximately 30 min) and were then sent to the next experiment. The condition order was counterbalanced across participants. The speed of the vehicle was displayed on the lower left-hand corner of each subject’s screen in order to help them maintain a speed of 80 km/h.   
The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experimental procedure 
  

The sub-task consisted of performing an addition. The addition task consisted of problems using double-digit numbers with sums of less than 100 and required carry-over calculations. Each block consisted of 10 problems. Thus, there were a total of 30 problems in the addition task. The experimenters used the audio system attached to the MR system to vocally present the task and the subjects confirmed the answers using their voices. The subjects were encouraged to concentrate on both driving and the addition tasks. 


### Image acquisition 
  
Images were scanned using a 3T MRI system (Magnetom TrioTim, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard 32-channel head coil. Single-shot echo planar fMRI scans were acquired in 29 continuous slices parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line. The parameters for fMRI were as follows: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 3000/30 ms, field of view (FOV) = 200 mm, flip angle = 90°, matrix = 128 × 128, slice thickness = 5 mm, and voxel size = 1.6 × 1.6 × 5.0 mm. Anatomical images were obtained using a T1-weighted three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence with TR/TE = 1900/2.48 ms, FOV = 200 mm, flip angle = 9°, matrix = 256 × 256, slice thickness = 1 mm, and voxel size = 0.8 × 0.8 × 1.0 mm. 


### Image analysis 
  
The fMRI data were analyzed using SPM 8 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). All functional images were aligned with the anatomic images of the study using affine transformation routines built into the SPM 8 program. The realigned scans were co-registered to the participant’s anatomic images obtained within each session. The anatomical images were then segmented into white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The mean echo planar image (EPI) of each subject was directly warped into the standard EPI template (Montreal Neurologic Institute) during a normalization step. The size of one divided voxel in normalizing process is 1.6 × 1.6 × 3 mm. The time-series data were motion-corrected by Sinc interpolation and filtered using a 240-s high-pass filter to remove artifacts because of cardiorespiratory and other cyclical influences. The functional images were then smoothed using a 8-mm full-width-half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel prior to statistical analyses. The statistical analysis was conducted using SPM 8 both individually (first level) and as a group (second level) using the general linear model and the theory of Gaussian random fields. Statistical parametric maps were computed using   t  -statistics. Individual subjects were analyzed at a significance threshold of   p   < 0.05, which was corrected using the topological peak-false discovery rate (FDR). 

The active regions of the brain during driving only condition and driving with sub-task condition were extracted and compared to those of the control phase using the subtraction method ([driving only or driving with sub-task condition]—control). The double subtraction method was used to observe any regions exhibiting special activity during either driving condition (driving only—driving with sub-task and driving with sub-task—driving only conditions). 

We also extracted the numbers of activation area voxels during driving only condition and driving with sub-task condition using the subtraction method for each subject. We then performed a paired   t  -test (PASW Statistics 18) to compare the numbers of activation area voxels by condition. 



## Results 
  
### Accuracy rate 
  
When only the addition task was performed (sub-task only condition), the accuracy rate of the subjects was 84.8 ± 10.9%. The accuracy rate was 78.5 ± 11.7% when the addition task was combined with driving (driving with sub-task condition) (Table  ). No differences of note were observed using a paired   t  -test (PASW Statistics 18) (  p   = 0.196).

### Brain activation regions determined using the subtraction method 
  
During driving only condition, the frontal region (inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and precentral gyrus), parietal region (superior parietal lobe (SPL), inferior parietal lobe (IPL), postcentral gyrus, and precuneus), temporal region (superior temporal gyrus (STG) and middle temporal gyrus (MTG)), occipital region (inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), superior occipital gyrus (SOG), middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and lingual gyrus), limbic region (cingulate gyrus), sub-lobar region (insula and lentiform nucleus), and the cerebellum (uvular, declive, and cerebellar tonsil) all exhibit activation (Table   and Fig.  ).

During driving with sub-task condition, the frontal region (IFG, MFG, SFG, precentral gyrus, and sub-gyral), parietal region (postcentral gyrus), temporal region (STG and fusiform gyrus), occipital region (IOG and lingual gyrus), limbic region (cingulate gyrus), sub-lobar region (lentiform nucleus, insula, claustrum, thalamus, cuneus, and caudate), and the cerebellum (cerebellar tonsil and inferior semi-lunar lobule) were shown to have activation (Table   and Fig.  ).

In order to compare the numbers of activation area voxels for each condition calculated using the above subtraction method, we performed a paired   t  -test by extracting the areas activated in common. 

The number of activation voxels was significantly reduced in areas such as the MFG (  p   = 0.046) and the precentral gyrus (  p   = 0.033) during driving with sub-task condition when compared to the driving only condition. On the other hand, when driving and performing the sub-tasks simultaneously, the number of activation voxels was significantly increased in the postcentral gyrus (  p   = 0.031) and the insula (  p   = 0.011) when compared to driving only condition. Other commonly activated areas were IFG, SFG, STG, IOG, cingulate gyrus, lentiform nucleus, and the cerebellar tonsil. There were no significant differences between the two conditions in these areas. 

During sub-task only condition, the frontal region (IFG, MFG, SFG, and precentral gyrus), parietal region (IPL), temporal region (inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), MTG, STG, and caudate), limbic region (cingulate gyrus), sub-lobar region (lentiform nucleus and insula), and the cerebellum (uvula, culmen, and declive) showed signs of activation (Table   and Fig.  ).

### Brain activation regions determined using the double subtraction method 
  
The double subtraction method was used to observe the regions of the brain that exhibited special activation when the subject was only driving (driving only condition) or driving while performing a sub-task (driving with sub-task condition). 

The brain regions activated during driving only condition were subtracted from the regions that were activated during driving with sub-task condition. These results are presented in Table   and Fig.  . The results show that brain activation is increased in the frontal region (MFG, medial frontal gyrus (MeFG), and precentral gyrus), parietal region (SPL, IPL, postcentral gyrus, and precuneus), temporal region (MTG and STG), occipital region (IOG, SOG, MOG, lingual gyrus, and cuneus), limbic region (cingulate gyrus), and the cerebellum (uvula, declive, inferior semi-lunar lobule, and cerebellar tonsil). In particular, we observed a large increase in the superior parietal lobule. Large increases were also seen in the middle frontal gyrus, the middle occipital gyrus, and the uvula of the cerebellum. These regions correspond to those that have reduced or no activation when driving is performed along with secondary activities.

To determine the activated brain regions during driving with sub-task condition, the regional activation during driving with sub-task condition is subtracted from the activation during driving only condition. These results are summarized in Table   and Fig.  . The results indicate an increased activation in the frontal region (IFG, SFG, and precentral gyrus), temporal region (STG), limbic region (cingulate gyrus), sub-lobar region (lentiform nucleus, caudate, insula, and thalamus), and the cerebellum (culmen and declive). In particular, there are large activation increases in the superior temporal gyrus, the cingulate gyrus, the sub-lobar area, which includes the lentiform nucleus, caudate, insula, and thalamus.

## Discussion 
  
Here we analyzed the effects of conducting a sub-task (addition task) during driving on brain activation using fMRI. 

Notable differences were not observed in the accuracy rates sub-task only condition vs. driving with sub-task condition. It was expected that all of the experiment participants would show a higher task performance ability in the sub-task only condition rather than the driving with sub-task condition. Of the total of 15 participants, however, three showed opposite results. Before the experiment, all of the participants were requested to concentrate on the experiment (driving, task performance, etc.). But the three participants are deemed to have low concentration during their task performance in the sub-task only condition to show such a low accuracy. Additional study will be necessary in this regard. 

Brain activation during driving situations has consistently been the subject of ongoing research [ – ]. Just et al. [ ] used a computer mouse and trackball to simulate driving and reported that the parietal cortex, occipital cortex, motor cortex, and the cerebellum exhibit activation during this task. Uchiyama et al. [ ] used a joystick to control the vehicles and observed the IFG, MFG, SFG, IPL, SPL, MTG, basal ganglia, primary sensorimotor cortex (S1), and SMA. Hsieh et al. [ ] noted that while a driving scene is simply being observed, the MFG, IFG, STG, orbitofrontal cortex, occipital lobe, fusiform gyrus, cingulate gyrus, SMA, and the basal ganglia show activation. The results that we obtained during driving only condition show similar areas of activation (motor cortex, IPL, SPL, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellum; Table  ) to those observed in previous research. Previous studies [ ,  ,  ] simulated driving using a computer mouse or trackballs. In these studies, one hand was used in the simulator environment. However, in this study, the subjects controlled a driving wheel using both hands in a real driving environment and controlled pedals using the ankle of the right lower limb. Because of the movement of both the hands and the right foot, the left precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex, M1) appeared to have the voxels with the highest activation. We also observed activation of the motor control-related right premotor cortex, which is used in adjusting precise movements [ ,  ]. Since tactile sensory feedback is also generated through the wheel and the pedals, the right postcentral gyrus (S1) was activated [ ,  ]. The activation of the somatosensory association cortex in the left IPL (BA 40) at the supramarginal gyrus [ ] was especially great. In addition, we observed activations of the right precuneus area, which is related to visuomotor coordination [ ,  ], and the right fusiform gyrus (BA 37), which is related to high-level visual cognition [ ]. We also observed a larger number of activation voxels in the uvula of cerebellum, which is an area related to motor control and action planning [ ,  ,  ]. 

When driving and a secondary task (auditory language comprehension task) were performed simultaneously, similar areas (motor cortex and the parietal and occipital lobes) were activated. This is similar to what is observed when only driving is performed. However, the numbers of activation voxels and activity intensity was decreased in these areas while the temporal and inferior frontal regions related to the sub-task had increases in activation [ ]. Uchiyama et al. [ ] observed the activation of similar areas (motor cortex and parietal and occipital lobes) when driving was performed along with an auditory task. However, they also reported activation of the STG and the primary auditory cortex. We observed that similar regions (motor cortex, SPG, IPG, and MOG) were activated to those activated when the subjects only drove (Table  ). However, the numbers of activation voxels of these regions were decreased and the IFG and STG, which are related to the addition task showed activation. The IFG was noted as an area significantly associated with the performance of additional tasks in previous research [ ,  ]. Here, the same areas were activated during driving with sub-task condition and sub-task only condition (Tables   and  ). The additional activation of the STG is thought to occur because the experiment used in the study required the subjects to listen to and then respond to the additional task (Tables   and  ). Unlike in previous studies [ ,  ], we observed that the number of activation voxels in the postcentral gyrus (S1) and the insular cortex appeared high in driving with sub-task condition. Unlike previous studies, where a joystick, computer mouse, or trackball was used with one hand, our study required the subjects to adjust a driving wheel with both hands and pedals with the right foot. The grip force of both hands required to hold the driving wheel to concentrate (lane keeping) on driving increased when driving with sub-task condition compared to driving only condition. In addition, the right foot touched the pedal more frequently to keep the speed at 80 km/h. Thus, the left postcentral gyrus area, which is the somatosensory area [ ,  ], is expected to be activated significantly. In addition, when driving is performed simultaneously with a sub-task, hand movements were used to finely control the wheel in order to maintain the lane. These movements and those of the right ankle use for controlling the pedal to keep the speed at 80 km/h were more frequent. Thus, activation of the insula, which is related to perception, motor control, self-awareness, and cognitive function [ ], was shown to be significantly increased in both hemispheres. 

Just et al. [ ] used the double subtraction method to analyze differences in brain activation while driving and driving while performing a secondary task (an auditory language comprehension task). When drivers were focused only on driving, compared to when they drove while performing an auditory distraction task of language comprehension, the supramarginal gyrus, SPL, IPL, and SOG showed increased activation. In particular, activation voxels of the SPL had the largest increase. Based on our results, when drivers were focused only on driving compared to when they drove while performing a task, the SPL and IPL areas, which are related to spatial perception [ ], showed increased activation, similar to observations in previous studies. The visuomotor coordination-related left SPL [ ,  ] showed the largest increase. 

When drivers were focused only on driving compared to when they drove while performing a task, activation is thought to have increased in the above areas because the subjects were focused only on driving while controlling the wheel with both hands and controlling the pedals with their right foot. The parietal area is in charge of not only spatial processing but also visual spatial attention [ ]. Thus, it has been determined that secondary activities negatively affect functions related to driving. Unlike previous studies [ ], our study indicates that when drivers are focused driving only condition compared to driving with sub-task condition, the right MFG, which is the premotor cortex area related to spatial attention, movement planning, and execution [ ,  ], the visual-related right and left MOG [ ], and the action planning and motor control-related uvula of the cerebellum [ ,  ,  ] show remarkably increased activation (Table  ). The negative effects on these areas are thought to occur because performing sub-tasks interferes with information processing during driving. 

Compared to cases where only driving was performed, driving while performing additional tasks was shown to decrease brain activation in some regions, whereas other regions related to activity completion were additionally activated [ ,  ,  ]. We observed that driving with sub-task condition was performed compared to driving only condition, the SPL, MFG, MOG, and cerebellar regions related to driving had less activation (Table  ). In contrast, there was increased activation in the IFG and the STG, which affect secondary task completion (Tables  ,  , and  ). The cingulate gyrus region and the sub-lobar region (lentiform nucleus, caudate, insula, and thalamus) in particular showed evidence of increased activation (Table  ). These results can be attributed to the fact that when driving is paired with a secondary task, driving performance is affected. Moreover, the increase in desire to control increases the activation of the cingulate gyrus and sub-lobar regions, as they control error monitoring and unnecessary movement control, respectively [ ,  ,  ,  ]. In addition, during driving with sub-task condition, we observed activation of the right temporal gyrus (BA 38) region, which is related to highly processed perceptual inputs to visceral responses, for complex cognitive processing [ ,  ]. 

### Limitation 
  
Although not performed in this study, it is necessary to analyze the relationship between actual driving performance and brain activity by additionally extracting the activation patterns for a variety of driving performance conditions (maintaining driving speed, responding to uncertainties during driving, lane keeping, etc.) when driving and the sub-task are performed simultaneously. We would then carry out a study on how the sub-task affects actual driving performance. 



## Conclusions 
  
In conclusion, when driving and a sub-task were performed together (driving with sub-task condition—driving only condition), the regions associated with driving show less activation, as observed in previous studies. In particular, the spatial perception regions have the largest decreases among all the regions assessed. Unlike in previous research [ ,  ,  ], our double subtraction results (driving with sub-task condition—driving only condition) indicate a clear increase in activation in the cingulate gyrus and the sub-lobar region. Unlike the simple driving simulators used in previous research, which used joysticks, computer mouses, or trackballs for simulation, the addition of a driving wheel and pedals (accelerator and brake) to the driving simulator used in this study closely represents real driving. Thus, the number of processed movements increases, leading to an increased number of unnecessary movements that need to be controlled. This in turn increases the activation of the corresponding brain regions. 

There are numerous research studies investigating brain activation changes using simple driving simulators equipped with joysticks, computer mouses, or trackballs. However, research studies similar to ours, which employs a simulator that closely reflects reality, have been sparse in comparison. Further research on the effects of sub-tasks on brain activation of drivers of varied driving skills is required. This paper is expected to contribute basic data toward studying the effects of sub-tasks during driving.

# Abstract
 
Iron deficiency continues to be the most prevalent micronutrient deficit worldwide. Since iron is involved in several processes including myelination, dopamine neurotransmission and neuronal metabolism, the presence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in infancy relates to long-lasting neurofunctional effects. There is scarce data regarding whether these effects would extend to former iron deficient anemic human adults. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a novel technique to explore patterns of functional connectivity. Default Mode Network (DMN), one of the resting state networks, is deeply involved in memory, social cognition and self-referential processes. The four core regions consistently identified in the DMN are the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex and left and right inferior parietal cortex. Therefore to investigate the DMN in former iron deficient anemic adults is a particularly useful approach to elucidate de long term effects on functional brain. We conducted this research to explore the connection between IDA in infancy and altered patterns of resting state brain functional networks in young adults. Resting-state fMRI studies were performed to 31 participants that belong to a follow-up study since infancy. Of them, 14 participants were former iron deficient anemic in infancy and 17 were controls, with mean age of 21.5 years (±1.5) and 54.8% were males. Resting-state fMRI protocol was used and the data was analyzed using the seed based connectivity statistical analysis to assess the DMN. We found that compared to controls, former iron deficient anemic subjects showed posterior DMN decreased connectivity to the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), whereas they exhibited increased anterior DMN connectivity to the right PCC. Differences between groups were also apparent in the left medial frontal gyrus, with former iron deficient anemic participants having increased connectivity with areas included in DMN and dorsal attention networks. These preliminary results suggest different patterns of functional connectivity between former iron deficient anemic and control young adults. Indeed, IDA in infancy, a common nutritional problem among human infants, may turn out to be important for understanding the mechanisms of cognitive alterations, common in adulthood.

## Introduction 
  
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) continues to be the world most prevalent micronutrient deficit. Its frequency is greater in children and pregnant women and can affect up to 70% of population in many countries, particularly economically developing countries (Swaminathan et al.,  ). Even in developed countries, the prevalence of IDA in children can be as high as 4% (Jáuregui-Lobera,  ). In Chile, until as late as 1999, about 30% of the children under 2 years of age presented with IDA, often as a result of poor maternal health condition or poor dietary intake. Public health policies of “  fortification”   such as availability of formula milk at government health centers, caused prevalence of IDA in infants under 18 months of age to drop to 10% in a period of 10 years (Brito et al.,  ). Although the decreasing incidence is promising, it should be emphasized that iron is an important nutrient for brain development, and the impact of IDA in infancy development, even after iron therapy is of clinical relevance. Therefore, understanding the neural mechanisms through which the developing brain is coping with a nutrient deficiency may help improve therapeutic strategies aimed at optimizing brain functional integrity. 

Studies using rodent models indicate that early IDA modifies myelin protein profile, specifically the proteolipid protein and MBP 21 (myelin basic protein), both of them required for myelin compaction (Ortiz et al.,  ). Further, alteration in genes regulating dendritic morphology appears to alter experience-depending brain synaptic plasticity, derailing thus memory, learning and other developmental milestones (Georgieff,  ). 

In line with these results, there is mounting evidence that IDA in human infants is associated with long-lasting negative outcomes on several neurofunctional and cognitive domains, extending into adolescence (Algarín et al.,  ). We have shown that children who were properly treated for IDA during infancy, had delayed latencies in auditory and visual evoked potentials at preschool age. This slower neuronal transmission in both sensory systems is consistent with an impaired myelination process (Algarín et al.,  ). 

Animal models have shown that early iron deficiency modifies the dopaminergic neurotransmission system, altering the functioning of the hippocampus and frontal cortex, among other brain regions (Beard and Connor,  ). Moreover in rats, dopamine synaptic connections develop quickly during the first 15 days of post-natal life; iron deficiency throughout this period would likely influence these synaptic connections (Ward et al.,  ). Dopaminergic neurotransmission system is critically involved in executive functions which encompass a heterogeneous repertoire of abilities related to monitoring and controlling thought and action, including self-regulation, inhibitory motor, cognitive control, planning future actions, attentional flexibility and error detection and correction capacity, among others (Prencipe et al.,  ; Lantrip et al.,  ). These higher cognitive functions have been well studied in humans using both event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 

Using ERPs, measure brain electrical activity when a subject performs a task, we found that at 10 years of age, former IDA (FIDA) children exhibited longer reaction time and lower P300 amplitude in the Go/No-Go task, which evaluates inhibitory motor control (Algarín et al.,  ). These results are consistent with subsequent research using a recognition memory paradigm (also at 10 years of age) that found slower reaction time and smaller ERP response to new/old tasks with an almost equal level of performance accuracy, suggesting that the effects of IDA in infancy persisted into late childhood despite apparently normal behavior (Congdon et al.,  ). 

Neurophysiological and imaging assessments are complementary methods for the study of brain functions. There has been much progress regarding typical and atypical human brain activities at the group level using fMRI and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI; Dosenbach et al.,  ). Resting state networks (RSN) are defined by a set of functionally interacting spatially distant regions at rest (Biswal,  ). The networks are known to be organized in different functional systems that correlate to behavioral performance, allowing for further understanding of the significance of functional connectivity. Several studies on the developing brain show that the extent of brain regions exhibiting resting state functional connectivity increases from 2 weeks of age up to 2 years old (Lin et al.,  ). Fair et al. ( ) showed that functional connectivity between ventro-medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) differs among children, adolescents and young adults, whereas, regions involved with motor and conflict monitoring differs little throughout these periods. These results indicate that the motor system and goal directed behavior develop earlier than other cognitive systems. A recent report from Marek et al. ( ) showed that network connectivity decreases in early adolescence (13–15 years) and then increases from late adolescence to adulthood, with the exception of the link between two of the most recognized networks, the Default Mode Network (DMN) and fronto-parietal network. 

An important characteristic regarding the RSN, is the strength of the correlation between functional and structural connectivity. From rodent model, the results of the study conducted by Hübner et al. ( ) inducing brain demyelination, showed that functional connectivity was also altered, and the areas most affected were the posterior centers of DMN. In humans, myelination and functional connectivity develop parallel from birth until late adolescence (Stevens et al.,  ). Greicius et al. ( ) showed that there was not functional connectivity between hemispheres in absence of corpus callosum, reinforcing the concept that structural neural connections are required for functional connectivity. This hypothesis is further supported by studies showing that the strength of functional and structural connectivity is correlated in both healthy and patients with cognitive dysfunction (Hagmann et al.,  ). As an example, clinical evidence of the interaction between myelin disorder and functional connectivity alteration has been reported in patients with Multiple Sclerosis; subjects with an active lesion have increased functional connectivity that might be secondary to a compensatory mechanism for limiting and repairing the injury (Droby et al.,  ). 

Although there is some data regarding long-lasting cognitive effects in FIDA human adults (Lukowski et al.,  ), to our knowledge, there are no studies using rs-fMRI studies. Given that the DMN is a core brain network, the assessment of DMN in FIDA adults is particularly imperative in order to understand the long-lasting effects of IDA in infancy on neural functioning in adulthood. To achieve this, we used resting state fMRI to compare baseline whole-brain connectivity in both groups. We hypothesized that FIDA participants will present altered brain networks connectivity relative to control participants. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
Participants were part of a longitudinal cohort study, which began recruitment in 1990 in order to conduct research on the behavioral, neuro-functional development and sleep-wake patterns effects of IDA in infancy. Six cognitive follow-ups were conducted at 12 and 18 months, 3, 5, 10 and 16 years old. The follow-ups included, among other measurements, cognitive assessment, academic achievements, socioeconomical and nutritional status. In brief, inclusion criteria were healthy full-term infants with birth weights ≥3.0 kg, no perinatal complications, and no acute or chronic illnesses. Infants were assessed for IDA at 6, 12 and 18 months. Anemia was defined as venous hemoglobin ≤100 g/L at 6 months and <110 g/L at 12 and 18 months. Iron deficiency was defined as at least two out of three iron measures in the iron-deficient range (mean cell volume <70 fl, erythrocyte protoporphyrin >100 μg/dL red blood cells [1.77 μmol/L], serum ferritin <12 μg/L). For each IDA infant, a non-anemic (venous hemoglobin ≥115 g/L) infant of the same age was randomly selected, constituting the “control group”. After initial testing, all infants were given supplemental iron for 6–12 months (Lozoff et al.,  ). No participant presented IDA thereafter. 

In year 2014, all the cohort members who participated in the previous follow-ups and were approximately 22 years old were invited to perform a brain magnetic resonance. The present study involved 31 healthy young adult participants (17 controls and 14 FIDA) with a mean age of 21.5 years (±1.5 years), and 55% were male. 

For current and background characteristics of the subjects we compared the Graffar scale (socio-ecomomical status; Richaud et al.,  ), performed the Spanish version of Manual for the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI “Self-Evaluation Questionnaire”; Guillén-Riquelme and Buela-Casal,  ), and established current occupation (employee, studying or unemployed). 

The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology (INTA), University of Chile, Santiago, and the Office of Protection from Research Risks, NIH. Participants signed an informed consent. 

### Imaging Parameters 
  
fMRI was performed using Siemens Magnetom Skyra 3T scanner with parameters at TR = 2000 ms, TE = 35 ms with 16, 7.040-mm slices, 1-mm slice gap, and an in-plane resolution of 2.553 × 2.553 mm . Total of 200 time points were collected for every subject. For the anatomical T1 scan, imaging was performed on the same scanner with TR = 20 ms, TE = 4.92 ms with 303 slices and field of view (FOV) of 192 × 499 mm . 


### Preprocessing 
  
For all participants functional and anatomical image preprocessing was performed using statistical parametric mapping software (SPM 8 implemented using Matlab R2012b). After manually performing anterior commissure alignment for each participant, a realignment step was accomplished to correct for head motion. During this step, all scans of the participant were realigned to their first scan of the first session. The details of the transformation in six directions (  x  ,   y  ,   z  , roll, pitch and yaw) were stored as translation and rotation parameters. All participants were within the acceptable head motion range (less than 2 mm). After realignment, functional images were co-registered to the anatomical image (T1-weighted image) of that participant. Following successful co-registration of anatomical and functional images, segmentation was performed with SPM8 toolbox, and a probability map of gray matter, white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained. Simultaneously, a field vector storing information on the transformation from native subject space to standard template (Montreal Neurologic Institute, MNI template) was calculated. For each participant, the functional image was transformed to MNI space based on the deformation field and re-sampled to 3 mm isotropic voxel size. A binary mask of WM and CSF was created when a threshold for the WM/CSF maps obtained from segmentation step at   p   > 0.98 was applied (Biswal et al.,  ). In order to remove the confounding effects of WM, CSF and head motion, they were included as nuisance variables in linear regression model. The nuisance variable for linear regression included five principal components of WM and CSF obtained from WM and CSF masks. The regression input also included six time series describing head motion in six directions, six time series describing head motion in previous time points and 12 time series describing quadratics of motion. The residual of linear regression was temporally bandpass filtered at 0.01–0.1 Hz and spatially smoothened using a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half maximum. This filtered and smoothened data was used for further analysis. Acquisition, processing and analysis were performed to whole brain. 


### Seed Based Connectivity 
  
To analyze the intrinsic functional connectivity of PCC with the whole brain, two spheres of 5 mm radius was generated and used as a seed for left and right PCC seeds using MNI coordinates. RSN were obtained from coherent fluctuations of 0.01–0.1 Hz frequency occurring at spatially distinct regions through underlying monosynaptic or polysynaptic anatomical connections. Therefore, such RSN can be derived using any seed within a network. Seeds of 5 mm radius were also generated for left and right medial frontal gyrus (MFG), another major component of DMN. For all four seeds, the average blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series was calculated for each seed region and a whole brain voxel wise Pearson’s r correlation was performed for each subject. Subject level correlation maps were later converted to z-maps using r-z Fisher transformation. 


### Regions of Interest (ROI)-Based Connectivity 
  
In addition to seed based correlation of the PCC and MFG, a total of 160 regions of interests (ROIs) were created based on the list defined by Dosenbach et al. ( ). All ROIs were sorted based on RSN’s: 1. Cerebellar, 2. Cingulo-Opercular, 3. Default mode, 4. Fronto-Parietal, 5. Occipital, and 6. Sensoriomotor networks. Using the predefined MNI coordinates, a 5 mm radius sphere was created surrounding the peak voxel sampled at the same voxel dimensions of participants BOLD fMRI image. Nine ROIs were discarded as they were not within the brain mask of at least one subject. Using the remaining 151 ROI as mask, an average BOLD signal for each ROI was calculated for all participants. Pearson’s r correlations were calculated between the BOLD signals of each ROI with remaining ROI. Hence a 151*151 correlation matrix was generated for each participant. Each 151*151 correlation matrix was transformed into Z-matrices using Fisher’s r-z transformation. 


### Statistical Analysis 
  
#### Seed Based analysis 
  
The z-maps were concatenated to create two 4D functional z-maps, one for each group. An unpaired two-sample two tailed   t  -test was performed on the 4D inputs with gender as covariate using Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library randomized implementation. All statistical comparisons were performed only for voxels that were present across all subjects. Further, Monte-Carlo simulation was implemented to perform cluster based thresholding on the uncorrected voxel-wise p-maps to correct for multiple comparison problem. 


#### ROI Based Connectivity 
  
An independent sample   t  -test was performed on the ROI pairs to compare the connectivity between FIDA and control groups at   p   < 0.001. Due to the small sample size, the statistical threshold was set to lenient with no additional correction for multiple comparison problems. 




## Results 
  
Control and FIDA groups were similar in current characteristics, including socioeconomic status, emotion scales and gender (Table  ).

### Seed Based Connectivity Analysis 
  
#### Posterior Cingulate Cortex 
  
Seed based analysis of left and right PCC resulted in a connectivity map involving core anatomical regions of DMN, including bilateral ventral medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, lateral temporal cortex, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal formation. Randomization method performed on both left and right PCC z-maps resulted in voxel-based p-maps for contrast 1) Control > FIDA and 2) FIDA > Control. P-maps of right PCC thresholded at   p   < 0.02 with Monte Carlo cluster size = 38.9 voxels resulted in two clusters greater in Control (Figure   and Table  ) and one cluster greater in FIDA (Figure   and Table  ) participants. Similarly, randomization results of left PCC threshold at   p   < 0.02 with Monte Carlo cluster size = 40.3 voxels resulted in five clusters greater in Controls and no clusters greater in FIDA (Figure   and Table  ). Regions showing decreased connectivity to left and right PCC in FIDA group included regions of posterior DMN such as cuneus, PCC, parahippocampal gyrus, medial temporal gyrus and lingual gyrus. In contrast, regions presenting increased connectivity to right PCC in FIDA group included regions of anterior DMN and anterior cingulate cortex.

#### Medial Frontal Gyrus (MFG) 
  
Seed based analysis of left and right MFG resulted in a connectivity map involving core anatomical regions of DMN. Randomization method performed on both left and right MFG z-maps resulted in voxel-based p-maps for contrasts 1) Control > FIDA and 2) FIDA> Control. P-maps of both left and right MFG in the contrast Control > FIDA were not statistically significant after Monte Carlo cluster thresholding at   p   < 0.02. However, the FIDA > Control contrast condition of left MFG threshold at   p   < 0.02 with Monte Carlo cluster size = 38.3 voxels resulted in nine clusters greater in FIDA. The regions exhibiting increased connectivity to left MFG in FIDA group included DMN and dorsal attention networks. The list of regions and their coordinates mainly includes the intraparietal lobule and precuneus (Table   and Figure  ).

### ROI Based Connectivity Analysis 
  
Control and FIDA groups showed greater connectivity within Cerebellum, DMN and Occipital networks as compared to between network connectivity. Based on the connectivity matrix, FIDA participants presented a scattered decrease in negative connectivity between Cingulo-opercular, Fronto-parietal and Sensory motor networks with DMN, and decrease in positive connectivity within DMN network. Otherwise, they exhibited a sparse increase in positive connectivity within Cingulo-opercular and Fronto-parietal networks (Figure  ).

## Discussion 
  
These preliminary findings based on specific rs-fMRI assessments suggest different patterns of functional connectivity between FIDA and control young adults. 

Seed based connectivity results show that FIDA participants have decreased connectivity of the left PCC with posterior DMN regions, relative to control participants. The PCC is a highly connected and metabolically active brain region and a component of several RSN. The link between PCC and DMN is of particular importance due to the possibility of the PCC’s role as a “hub” interacting with multiple brain networks to allocate cognitive resources to different tasks (Leech and Sharp,  ). 

Our findings are reminiscent of DMN patterns observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, as Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, multiple sclerosis, autism and Parkinson disease (Sandrone and Catani,  ). In fact, DMN regions showing decreased connectivity to left and right PCC in FIDA group included regions of posterior DMN such as cuneus, PCC, and parahippocampal gyrus, is also found in a majority of patients with Alzheimer disease and other types of dementia (Chhatwal et al.,  ). 

Furthermore, several studies of subjects at high risk for these disorders, including healthy relatives of patients with late onset of Alzheimer disease, have demonstrated that DMN patterns, particularly PCC and medial temporal cortex changes, are present before the disorder’s onset and could even early marker of the disease (Wang et al.,  ). For instance, a study in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease showed alterations in DMN connectivity in both symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic mutations, with a higher connectivity decrease in symptomatic carriers. Of note, subtle decreases in DMN connectivity were observable before symptom onset (Chhatwal et al.,  ). 

Otherwise from the field of cognitive development, individuals with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder—a condition related to impairment of dopamine neurotransmission system—are characterized by a decreased connectivity between precuneus and other DMN components (Somandepalli et al.,  ), and a negative relationship between the activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and DMN (Castellanos et al.,  ). Correspondingly, studies in patients with schizophrenia, another illness associated with an alteration in the dopamine system, show decreased strength in DMN nodes connectivity, suggesting that these patterns could underlie symptoms such as impaired self-awareness (Dodell-Feder et al.,  ). A recent study in healthy subjects compared the neurological soft signs (NSS) score and the grade of connectivity among cortical and subcortical areas related to motor function. The results showed a negative correlation between NSS score (lower score means better performance) and resting state-activity of right posterior cingulate. NSS have been found in psychiatric disorders of neurodevelopmental origin such as schizophrenia, autism and borderline personality, among others conditions that involve dopamine and myelin alterations (Thomann et al.,  ). 

Throughout brain development network properties increase integration and decrease segregation, thus WM maturation might play an important role in circuit formation or changes in their strengths (Hagmann et al.,  ). There are several studies showing a close relationship and a highly complex interaction between structural connectivity (myelin tracts) and functional connectivity (Greicius et al.,  ). Based on these results we speculate that a derailment in myelination process may reshape the connectivity map and explain in part, our finding of a connectivity absence in the posterior region of DMN in FIDA participants. 

The effects of IDA in infancy on dopamine neurotransmission system could be explore assessing the executive functions, i.e., inhibitory control, set-shifting and planning, high cognitive abilities that relies on the integrity of frontostriatal circuits, in which the dopaminergic system plays a key role. At 10 years old, FIDA participants from our longitudinal study, showed a mild impairment performing an inhibitory motor task (Algarín et al.,  ). A follow-up study performed in Costa Rica indicated that FIDA at 19 years presented greater difficulty performing executive functions test (Lukowski et al.,  ). In the present study at 22 years old, a decreased DMN connectivity characterized FIDA subjects. Therefore, it is reasonable to argue that different DMN patterns in FIDA young adults might also refer to a dopaminergic dysregulation. 

The MFG—another key node of DMN (Passow et al.,  )—is involved in decision making and reasoning processes (Talati and Hirsch,  ). In the present study the FIDA group demonstrated increased connectivity to the left MFG including DMN and dorsal attention networks, primarily included intraparietal lobule and precuneus. Sang et al. ( ) reported greater nodal centrality in MFG and parietal lobule regions in patients with Parkinson disease and proposed that these areas are highly connected to compensate for deficits caused by the disease. 

Given that we did not perform a task based fMRI, it is not possible to determine whether the increased connectivity between brain circuits at rest relates to a decreased activation or suppression of DMN during tasks requiring higher cognitive resources. However, we could suggest that differences in intrinsic functional organization in the resting state, may contribute to change the interactions among specific brain regions while performing a task. 

Finally, a recent study in preschool age children showed that early life stressful events are associated with greater activity of rs-fMRI in left middle frontal gyrus, independent of other variables as poverty, violence exposure and exposure to a traumatic event (Demir-Lira et al.,  ). These results provide further support for the hypothesis that environment factors like micronutrient deficits (IDA), could generate persistent effects on neurofunctional domains, including resting state connectivity, more than 20 years after the nutritional insult (Lozoff et al.,  ). 

An important limitation for the interpretation of the results is the lower spatial resolution of axial slicing of rs-fMRI and the small sample size. Notwithstanding, differences in brain connectivity between groups in specific regions were significant. The correlation analysis among connectivity results and behavioral tasks are not presented in this manuscript. Given the small sample size, one of our goals is to increase the number of participants to correlate rs-fMRI findings with behavioral results in future studies. 

In conclusion, the results of the rs-fMRI study show altered brain connectivity patterns in otherwise healthy FIDA young adults. Based on the hypothesis of long-lasting effects of IDA in infancy on myelination and dopaminergic system functioning, it should be possible to design studies with specific fMRI imaging measures known to depend on these systems and processes. Whether altered brain connectivity in FIDA participants influences the progression of specific cognitive functions and neurodegenerative diseases with advancing age is part of our ongoing research challenges.

# Abstract
 
We present here the first neuroimaging data for perception of Cued Speech (CS) by deaf adults who are native users of CS. CS is a visual mode of communicating a spoken language through a set of manual cues which accompany lipreading and disambiguate it. With CS, sublexical units of the oral language are conveyed clearly and completely through the visual modality without requiring hearing. The comparison of neural processing of CS in deaf individuals with processing of audiovisual (AV) speech in normally hearing individuals represents a unique opportunity to explore the similarities and differences in neural processing of an oral language delivered in a visuo-manual vs. an AV modality. The study included deaf adult participants who were early CS users and native hearing users of French who process speech audiovisually. Words were presented in an event-related fMRI design. Three conditions were presented to each group of participants. The deaf participants saw CS words (manual + lipread), words presented as manual cues alone, and words presented to be lipread without manual cues. The hearing group saw AV spoken words, audio-alone and lipread-alone. Three findings are highlighted. First, the middle and superior temporal gyrus (excluding Heschl’s gyrus) and left inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis constituted a common, amodal neural basis for AV and CS perception. Second, integration was inferred in posterior parts of superior temporal sulcus for audio and lipread information in AV speech, but in the occipito-temporal junction, including MT/V5, for the manual cues and lipreading in CS. Third, the perception of manual cues showed a much greater overlap with the regions activated by CS (manual + lipreading) than lipreading alone did. This supports the notion that manual cues play a larger role than lipreading for CS processing. The present study contributes to a better understanding of the role of manual cues as support of visual speech perception in the framework of the multimodal nature of human communication.

## Introduction 
  
There is increasing evidence that sensory-deprived individuals make adjustments to their sensory loss in order to interact effectively within their environment. These adaptations are linked to changes occurring at multiple regions of the brain ( ). For people who are deaf from birth or lost their audition early in life, neural plasticity of the regions classically associated with auditory and speech sound processing is related not only to lack of auditory experience but also to the timing and nature of language experience ( ). Among the children born deaf, the majority is born to hearing parents, and only 5% have deaf parents. The modality in which language is conveyed can be very different from one deaf child to another: from auditory-oral (listening, talking, and lipreading and facial expressions, known as speechreading), to visual communication strategies like Cued Speech (CS, supporting perception of spoken language with hand shapes that disambiguate lipreading, see below), and/or Sign Language (SL, sign for each language concept, with a grammar of its own). Recently,   suggested that the nature of language experience (signed vs. oral) has an impact on the development of gray matter volume in the cerebral regions processing language measured in deaf adults, but this point remains to be confirmed. 

The timing of language experience can also vary among deaf children. Some of them have daily access to a fully perceivable linguistic input through SL or CS during the first year(s) of life when cerebral plasticity is as its greatest ( ) while others only have partial access to auditory input (via the cochlear implant) and/or a late access (after the age of 4 years) to visual languages like SL and CS. For instance, deaf children who use SL from early in infancy outperform deaf children who are late learners in tests of SL proficiency and even in tests of English proficiency ( ,  ). Those children who are exposed to SL only at a later age show long-term language deficits ( ;  ). Delayed acquisition of SL as a first language is related to structural changes in the visual cortex (less gray-matter concentration in V1/V2 and V3a/V7 in late signers), and this effect is independent of auditory deprivation ( ). 

Here we tested, for the first time to our knowledge, the language neural processing of congenitally deaf adults who were exposed from early years to spoken language fully perceivable through the visual modality. Since spoken language has evolved to be primarily heard, not seen, critical features like voicing or nasality cannot be perceived by eye only. Among systems dedicated to make spoken language entirely visible to deaf persons, CS is the most widespread one. 

Cued Speech ( ) is a visual communication system used with and among deaf and hard-of-hearing persons. It is a system which delivers consonant-vowel (CV) dyads in the spoken language using a small number of handshapes and locations as a supplement to lipreading (see   Figure    for the English and French versions of CS). Handshapes and the location in space where the hand is placed combined with the mouth movements of speech make all the syllables and phonemes of spoken language appear distinct from each other. Consonants that have similar mouth movements (like /p/, /b/ and /m/) are coded with different handshapes (1, 4, and 5, respectively). Consonants that are coded by the same handshape (like /p/, /d/ and /Ʒ/) are easily distinguished by lipreading. Vowels indistinguishable on the lips (for instance French /y/ and /u/) are coded at different hand locations, and the same location is used to code vowels different on the lips. 
  
 The French and English Cued Speech codes.   Complete diagram of hand shapes and hand positions of French and English CS. In CS, the speaker holds one hand near the mouth while speaking to complement lipreading with a manual cue. A cue in CS is made of two parameters: hand shape   (left)   and hand position of execution around the mouth   (right)  . For example, syllables as /pa/, /ba/ or /ma/ cannot be distinguished using lipreading because they provide similar visual information. In CS, the syllables /pa/, /ba/ or /ma/ can be easily distinguished by simply using three different hand shapes. 
  
Each time a speaker pronounces a CV syllable, he/she adds manually information about the word’s phonological structure that is not entirely visible on the lips, by producing a handshape at a particular location in relation to the head and upper body (see   Figure   ). Take the example of a speaker producing the syllable /pa/. From the lips, the receiver perceives /pa/, /ba/, or /ma/. When the manual cue is added (i.e., handshape n° 1 representing /p, d, j/, produced at the side of the face representing /a, oe, o/ vowels), the uncertainty is reduced, and the syllable /pa/ remains the only possibility. Indeed, /ba/ and /ma/ are eliminated on the basis of the information read from the handshape, and /da/ and /ja/ are incompatible with the information read on the lips. From this example, it clearly appears that CS handshapes and hand locations are not themselves interpretable as syllables or phonemes. The integration of manual and labial information is mandatory to perceive an unambiguous syllable. Deaf users of CS are thus afforded access to the words in a spoken language in which sublexical features are entirely specified solely by visible articulatory gestures, i.e., manual cues and mouth movements. 

Cued Speech was created in the 1960s with the aim of allowing deaf children to accurately perceive spoken language and improving their literacy skills ( ;  ). However, the overall effect of CS on early spoken language development extends beyond this ( ,  ,  ). The empirical evidence collected in English, French, Spanish, Farsi and even Amharic (national language of Ethiopia) shows that congenitally deaf children who were exposed to CS from their earliest months by their parents and other caregivers can reach levels of mastery of spoken (phonology, lexical, morpho-syntactic) language and written language (word reading, reading comprehension, spelling) within range of age-matched hearing peers when tested at school age. Children with late and less intensive exposure (i.e., at the age of 5–6 years, and at school only) do not demonstrate the outstanding phonological and reading abilities of the early CS-users, confirming the existence of a sensitive period for language acquisition via the visual modality ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). 

It is this evidence for comparable language abilities reached by congenitally deaf individuals who are early CS-users and NH individuals which raise our interest concerning how the human brain processes linguistic information when conveyed by handshapes and speech-based mouth actions, compared to when conveyed by AV speech. To put this research into perspective, we summarize below critical points about auditory speech processing stream and the way in which lipread signals are integrated with the auditory speech stream. Next the neural basis of visual language perception (SL and speechreading) in deaf participants is discussed. We address the commonalities and differences between SL and CS. Finally, the knowledge about time course of manual and mouth movements articulation in CS is summarized, introducing our three research hypotheses concerning the comparison of neural activation of CS and AV speech. 

### Neural Basis of Audiovisual Speech Processing 
  
For hearing people, speech perception is a multimodal phenomenon. It is known since long that vision is of great help for hearing in noise and adverse conditions ( ;  ). The neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of audiovisual (AV) interactions in the human cortex have been abundantly explored in the last 15 years (see   for a review;  ,  ;  ). The acoustic speech signal projects posteriorly from Heschl’s convolutions within lateral temporal cortex to further superior temporal regions (secondary auditory cortex). The mid-posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) appears to be a prominent site for AV speech integration ( ;  ;  ;  ), with yet more posterior regions around the temporo-parietal sulcus being implicated specifically in lip movement perception (see  ). 

Neuroanatomical studies displayed three types of AV interactions. First, there are direct connections between sensory cortices ( ). Second, associative areas and particularly the pSTS play a crucial role in AV speech perception (e.g.,  ,  ). Third, parieto-frontal areas related to speech production are involved through the dorsal route (see  ;  ,  ;  ). Electrophysiological studies revealed that the influence of visual speech in cortical auditory processing can occur within 100 ms of signal onset, suggesting that lipreading exerts an early effect on auditory signal resolution ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). 


### Neural Activity Related to Lipreading 
  
Since two decades now, the cortical substrates for lipreading in hearing and deaf participants have been widely investigated with neuroimaging techniques. In hearing people, silent lipreading engages activation of pSTS and middle temporal gyrus, and inferior frontal regions ( ,  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ). These regions are similar to those engaged when speech is heard. Activation of left pSTS is correlated with hearing participant’s lipreading skills ( ). 

Some deaf individuals become better lipreaders than normally hearing individuals, i.e., deaf individuals may be better than hearing persons to extract information about spoken language structure from visible lip movements, jaws, and face ( ;  ;  ). The variability among deaf individuals is partly explained by their practice and knowledge of oral language. Indeed, those deaf individuals exposed daily to CS from their early years become very proficient lipreaders ( ), likely because precise lipreading is a mandatory component in CS perception. 

Variability among deaf lipreaders also appears in neuroanatomical studies.   asked deaf and hearing participants to silently lipread numbers (from 1 to 9) in a scanner. They found that temporal activation was more dispersed on different sites and less intense in the group of deaf participants. They suggested that coherent exposition to AV speech may play an important role for the structuration of temporal cortex for visual speech. In a second study,   found that the cingular cortex is a structure more activated during lipreading in deaf people than in hearing ones. A conjunction analysis of the data of these two studies revealed posterior activation of cingular cortex (BA23/30, related to visuo-spatial functions) in the deaf adults, and a bilateral activation of superior temporal areas (BA22/42) in the hearing adults. The deaf group showed activation of superior temporal gyrus (BA22) on the right side, extending into the tip of Heschl’s gyrus (BA42, part of the secondary auditory cortex), suggesting a predominantly right lateralized network in deaf people. 

 realized a further study in which congenitally deaf adults who were native signers and proficient speechreaders and hearing non-signing controls searched for a lipread target (the word “yes”) embedded in lists of silently spoken unrelated words from an open list. Participants pushed a button only when they identified the target word. The control condition was a speaker at rest. The results showed a strong activation of temporal superior gyrus, and in regions located in the Heschl’s gyrus, especially on the left side, in deaf as well as in hearing participants. Inferior frontal gyrus was also activated in both groups, which may reflect the involvement of mirror neurons in lipreading ( ;  ;  ). Lipreading ability was assessed outside the scanner, with the Test of Adult Speechreading (TAS,  ). In deaf participants, the neural activations during lipreading were positively correlated with the TAS score. Deaf participants showed greater activation than hearing participants in the left temporal cortex, including the planum temporale and Heschl’s gyrus. Compared to the two previous studies, the   one differed on a number of variables (nature of the baseline task, task requirement, stimulus type, and size of the group of deaf participants). These variables can possibly explain the differences in the results obtained (see  , p. 1239). The conclusion is particularly relevant to our study: the authors assumed that if the superior temporal cortex is not used to process auditory speech, it may be recruited to process visual speech, to a larger extent than in hearing participants in whom AV speech perception is dominant (see also  ;   for related data). 

Part of the activation induced by lipreading must be related to visual movement detection and to the perception of biological movement, especially in the inferior and posterior regions of the temporal cortex ( ). But most of the activation in superior temporal regions is related to lipreading itself. Therefore, the observation of more activation related to lipreading in deaf individuals than in hearing people in the pSTS suggests the following interpretation. The pSTS is an AV integration site in hearing people, but cannot play this role in deaf individuals. The activation of pSTS could be sensitive to the dominant language modality. This multimodal region could have developed sensitivity to visual speech for deaf individuals, and to auditory speech, and secondary to visual speech for hearing ones. Given that our early CS-users participants did not hear during their early years, and have been intensively exposed to lipreading + manual cues in daily communication, one may expect to observe a strong activation of pSTS during CS perception. 


### Neural Activity Related to Sign Language 
  
Sign language is the preferred means of communication for most of deaf persons. Deaf persons use visible actions from the hands, the head and the trunk to communicate meanings using phonological, lexical and morpho-grammatical rules. The articulators are visible gestures, and language perception is in the visuo-spatial modality. SLs are adapted to the human’s processing abilities in the visual modality, as are spoken languages in the auditory modality ( ). For instance, signs take longer to be articulated, but the mean duration of utterances is similar in SL and in English for ASL-English bilinguals ( ). 

Similarities between sign and spoken language processing have been abundantly demonstrated. Lesion-based, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological studies have provided strong evidence for the importance of left perisylvian regions during production and perception-comprehension of signed as well as spoken languages ( ;  ;  ;  ). The left inferior frontal gyrus is involved in both sign and speech production while the left superior temporal gyrus and sulcus, in addition to the left inferior frontal gyrus, are involved in sign and spoken language perception-comprehension. 

Differences related to the visual signal delivered by the articulatory gestures have been revealed between AV seen speech (lipreading) and SL perception ( ;  ;  ;  ). The kinematic characteristics of SL and AV speech are very different. There is more movement in the moving image of sign than speech. Different parts of the visual recognition system are sensitive to movements of particular body-parts (mouth specific vs. hand specific regions in inferior temporal cortex, see  ). The articulators in AV speech and SL thus have different timing, dynamic, and visibility, and their perception elicit different brain activity. SL perception induces greater activation than AV speech in movement processing regions of the posterior temporal gyri, bilaterally, while AV speech perception generates greater activation than SL in auditory processing regions in superior temporal cortices, including the planum temporale ( ;  ). 

Of particular relevance for the present study is the fact that some signs require mouth movements in addition to manual movements. Some of these mouth movements allow distinguishing minimal pairs of signs in SL ( ;  ). Activations corresponding to mouth movements, distinct from those related to hand movements have been found during SL perception ( ). Compared to manual only signs, signs including mouth movement elicit more activation in middle and posterior portions of the superior and middle temporal gyri, and in the inferior and middle frontal gyri, bilaterally. The manual only signs elicited activation in the right occipito-temporal cortex, and the fusiform gyrus. As the moving hand adopting several distinct configurations around the face is a important articulator in CS (see   Figure   ), one may expect to find more activation in the temporal posterior regions, and perhaps in the temporo-occipital posterior inferior regions in CS than in AV speech. 


### Similarities and Differences between CS and SL 
  
Cued Speech, such as cued American English, has similarities and differences with SL. Like SL, CS is conveyed in the visual modality and can be used for social communication, as evidenced by interactions within the family unit, and among “cuers” in social events. Similarly to SL, the use of voice is not needed in order to communicate in CS: “cuers” can achieve 100% speech perception when manual cues and mouth movements are presented, without sound ( ). Finally, for SL as for CS, presentation of a single phonological parameter of the lexeme cannot, on its own, generate a lexical item (similar handshapes and hand locations occur with multiple lexemes in CS, as similar handshapes do in SL). Even more relevant to the present study is the fact that some signs requiring mouth actions in SL cannot be interpreted unambiguously at the lexical level when presented in isolation (see  ). This is also the case in CS where the manual cues cannot, on their own, generate access to a lexical item. Accurate perception of CS thus necessarily involves the integration of manual and labial information in order to achieve a specific lexical representation. That is, for CS as well as for SL, individual sublexical features of articulation must be integrated to allow access to a specific lexical representation. 

There are also differences between CS and SL. First, CS is not a language, but rather a visual mode of communication of spoken language. CS is isomorphic to speech: it is a visual representation of the syllables and phonemes of spoken language while SLs have their own phonology based on manual articulatory parameters of hand location, handshapes, movement, and palm orientation ( ). Second, CS handshapes are produced at a much more rapid rate than SL. The production of handshapes at different locations around the face follows the rate of spoken speech, meaning that the CS receiver must decode a rapid succession of changing handshapes and hand placements, in a space located from the speaker’s eyes to the throat ( ,  ). In order to formulate more precise predictions about activations related to CS perception, it may be useful to know what has been revealed so far about the time course of mouth and hand movements in CS. This is the topic of the next section. 


### What Do We Know about Perception and Production of CS? 
  
 were the first to examine the precise temporal organization of CS production of syllables, words and sentences. Natural production of CS is characterized by a temporal anticipation of manual gesture over mouth opening: the hand movement begins up to 240 ms before the acoustic onset of a CV syllable, and the target position corresponding to the vowel is reached during the mouth production of the consonant, well before the vowel lip target. At the receptive level, deaf CS-users anticipate the linguistic target on the basis of “reading” the manual gesture: perception of the hand gives the first input for the selection of the possible phonemes pronounced, and the lips follow with the solution. Deaf people seem to extract first phonological information when a manual cue is produced, reducing the potential number of words compatible with the lipread signal.   data suggest that manual cues, as opposed to lipread information, can be the primary source of phonological information for deaf early CS users. Lipread information would then disambiguate the information provided by the manual cues ( ,  ;  ;  ). 


### Predictions Concerning the Neural Activation for AV Speech versus CS Perception? 
  
In this study, we compare the neural activations created by processing of spoken language produced and perceived through two different modalities: AV and CS. We control for language experience by testing only native users: NH participants with the AV material, and congenitally deaf participants with the CS material. We address three research questions. First, what are the similarities and differences between the processing of CS by early CS-users and the processing of AV speech by NH participants? This comparison is designed to explore common regions of activation for spoken language, independent of modality. Our second research question concerns the neural basis for integration of manual cues and lipread information. In CS, integration is mandatory and concerns two types of dynamic visible information, i.e., the movements of labial and manual articulators. In AV speech, integration concerns two modalities that are congruent in terms of their articulatory origins: the heard and seen results of movements of the oral articulators. We expected to find the pSTS as site of integration for AV speech, and we wanted to document brain regions critical for CS integration. Our third research question concerned the relative activation created by manual cues only and lipreading cues only compared to the activation created by the combined movements of lips and hands in CS. Some authors have suggested that the manual component of CS delivers more useful information than the lipread component to get access to the lexicon ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ). We hypothesize that the cortical activations may reveal greater activation for unisensory manual than labial movements, but also indicate specific locus/loci for integration of manual and labial information, different from those reported for AV integration. 



## Materials and Methods 
  
### Ethics Statement 
  
All participants gave written informed consent to participate in this study, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the ULB Erasme Hospital, and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (BMJ 1991; 302: 1194). 


### Participants 
  
Two groups of participants were recruited. The   CS group   consisted of 14 participants (3 males, 11 females), with a mean age of 25.0 years (age range = 18–33 years). All participants but one were congenitally profoundly deaf, with a binaural hearing loss > 90 dB (computed on 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) in their better ear. The remaining participant had a severe hearing loss (i.e., between 71 and 90 dB at the better ear). All deaf participants were equipped with hearing aids since they were between 6 months and 2 years of age, and none had a cochlear implant. 

The   NH group   consisted of 15 normally hearing French-speaking participants (six males, nine females), with no knowledge of CS. Their mean age was 25 years 2 months (age range = 20–37 years). 

Since native language involves a different brain network than second languages learned later in life ( ), only participants who were native French speakers were selected. A participant was considered a native language user if he/she had received consistent, age-appropriate speech stimulation from fluent users of French before the age of 3 years ( ). Currently, this criterion for native CS user can only be fulfilled within the deaf community, since nearly all NH people with an experience in French CS learned it later in their life. Consequently, only neural activity from deaf CS participants who were exposed at an   early (i.e., prelingual) age   is an appropriate comparison for the patterns of neural activity observed in native French speaking hearing participants. 

The deaf participants of the CS group in our study self-reported French as their native language in a questionnaire completed prior to enrolling in the study. They had been exposed to French CS, at home from their parents before the age of 3 years, and at school via teachers and or via transliterators from spoken French to French CS. Participants also reported that French CS was the language most commonly used during their childhood/adolescence, although most of them also learned SL informally during this period in contacts with deaf peers. The CS users reported that they still use CS often today, in daily communication with their family or other deaf persons. They also used oral French to communicate with NH individuals. The NH transliterator gave qualitative feedback about deaf participants’ CS comprehension: all of them could easily understand normal cued French conversation and were good at lipreading. All CS participants had finished secondary school (high school), and 50% (  n   = 7) had either completed a post-graduate program or were in one at the time of the testing. 

All deaf and hearing participants were right handed, with no known neurological or behavioral disorder. 


### Experimental fMRI Design (Procedure) 
  
In an event-related paradigm, a baseline condition and three experimental conditions were presented randomly intermixed to each group of participants. For deaf participants, the experimental conditions consisted of stimuli presented in CS (lipreading + manual cues), in lipreading alone, or in handshapes alone. For NH participants, the experimental conditions consisted of stimuli presented in AV, in auditory speech alone, or in lipreading alone. For both groups, the baseline condition consisted of a motionless face. 

#### Experimental Task and Conditions 
  
In the experimental conditions, all participants watched videos of a hearing female French speaker (who was a professional CS transliterator) saying a randomized list of 45 bisyllabic frequent words ( ) (see Annex for the full list of words used in this experiment) under six conditions (three for the NH group and three for the CS group; see below). All videos were recorded indoor (in a room). The female speaker was so positioned that her back was in contact with a white wall. She looked straight to the camera. Her full face and torso were shown in all videos in order to present a naturalistic display of CS. 

In the   NH group  , participants performed the detection task under three different experimental conditions: (1) the speech AV condition, in which the speaker pronounced the word while the same word was presented orally through MR-compatible earphones, (2) the auditory alone (A) condition, in which the word was presented aurally but the speaker’s face remained motionless, and (3) the lipreading alone (L) condition, in which the speaker pronounced the word but no auditory information was provided. In the   CS group  , participants performed also the detection task under three different experimental conditions: (1) the Cued Speech labial + manual (CSLM) condition, in which both lip movements and manual cues were visible, (2) the CS manual (CSM) condition, in which only hand movements were provided, but the speaker’s face remained still (no lips movements), and (3) the CS labial (CSL) condition, equivalent to lipreading, in which the speaker pronounced the word, but no manual movements were provided. 

For each condition, one video corresponded to one word. Altogether, there were 270 videos (i.e., 45 for each condition). Importantly, there was no manipulation of videos from one condition to another. For example, for the CSM condition, we did not create CS manual videos removing the lips information from the CS labial + manual videos. Instead, we recorded 45 videos in which the speaker had to produce the 45 words using only hand movements. Seemingly, in the CSL condition (lipreading condition), we recorded 45 videos in which the speaker pronounced the word without hand movements. The dynamic of both, hand movements produced in CSM videos and lip movements produced in CSL videos, have a great likeness when compared to the CSLM condition. 

The same words were used in all conditions but in different orders between conditions. In each of the three conditions, the target word “papa” (i.e., daddy) was included in the list of stimuli. In order to ensure focused attention to the stimuli, participants were asked to press a button when they detected “papa” (i.e., daddy). 


#### Control Task – Baseline Condition 
  
In order to control for attention, motor response parameters, and perception of a face and a body, a second task was designed. In this control task, all participants saw a still picture of the speaker’s full face and torso on screen, as in the experimental task (45 trials). They had to press a button when a small red circle was superimposed on the speaker’s chin. The group conditions are summarized in   Table   . 
  
Contrasts of the experimental conditions and the control condition. 
  

#### Procedure 
  
Before the presentation of each video, a white cross was displayed in the middle of the screen, indicating that the stimulus material (i.e., the video) would appear randomly within 1900–2800 ms. Then, the video containing the stimuli was displayed. The length of each video was also randomly assigned within 1900 and 2800 ms but, for all six conditions, they had the same mean of 2370 ms and the same standard deviation of 220 ms. In order to do this, we recorded each video with a length of 3 s, but leaving always a silent space at the end of at least 1200 ms in which the speaker’s face and torso remained present but still. This allowed us to adjust the required length for each video (by cutting the necessary time needed for each video). After the presentation of each video stimulus, a question mark appeared on the screen for 2000 ms, reminding the participant to press a button on the MR-compatible keypad (fORP; Current Designs) only if the participant had perceived the target word (i.e., “papa”), in one of the experimental conditions, or the target circle in the still control task. The target word or red circle appeared eight times within each condition. 

Presentation of the stimuli was randomized across the three experimental and the control conditions. Presentation of the stimuli and recording of the participant’s responses were realized using Cogent Graphics (running on Matlab  6.1) developed by John Romaya at the LON at the Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience. All participants practiced the tasks outside of the scanner beforehand to minimize task-learning effects. fMRI data acquisition had an approximate duration of 30 min. 



### fMRI Data Acquisition 
  
Data were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3-T (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) scanner using a T2  sensitive gradient echo (EPI) sequence (TR = 2130 ms, TE = , 40 ms, FA 90°, SENSE acceleration factor 2.5, matrix size 64 × 64 × 32; voxel size: 3.06 mm × 3.06 mm × 3 mm). Thirty-two contiguous 3-mm thick transverse slices were acquired, covering the whole brain. An approximate number of 840 EPI volumes per participant was acquired across the four conditions. Additionally, an anatomical image was obtained using a T1-weigthed sagittal 3D MP-RAGE sequence (TR 1960 ms, TE 4.60 ms, TI 1040 ms, flip angle 8°, FOV 250 mm × 250 mm, matrix size 320 × 320 × 160, interpolated voxel size: 0.78 × 0.78 × 1.0 mm). The MR scanner was equipped with the Quasar imaging gradients and an eight channel SENSE head coil. 


### fMRI Data Analysis 
  
Functional MRI data were pre-processed and analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) implemented in MATLAB 7.8 (Mathworks Inc., Sherbom, MA, USA). The first five functional EPI volumes were discarded to avoid magnetic saturation effects. The remaining EPI images were realigned ( ), spatially normalized into standard stereotactic MNI space ( ), and smoothed spatially at 8 mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) ( ). 

Data were analyzed using a mixed-random effects (RFX) model aimed at showing a stereotypical effect in the population from which the subjects were drawn ( ). For each subject, a first-level, intra-individual analysis aimed at modeling data to partition observed neurophysiological responses into components of interest, confounds, and errors, using a general linear model ( ). The regressors of interest were built using stick functions corresponding to the four conditions (45 stimuli each). These regressors were secondarily convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Movement parameters derived from realignment of the functional volumes (translations in x, y, and z directions and rotations around x, y, and z axes) were included as covariates of no interest in the design matrix. High-pass filtering was implemented in the matrix design using a cut-off period of 128 s to remove low drift frequencies from the time series. Serial correlations were estimated with a restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) algorithm using an intrinsic autoregressive model during parameter estimation. Effects of interests were then tested by linear contrasts (e.g., CSLM – still, Speech AV – still, CSLM vs. Speech AV, etc.), generating statistical parametric maps [SPM(T)]. 

Individual summary statistic images were further spatially smoothed (6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel) and entered in a second-level analysis in which participants were treated as a RFX. At this second level, one-sample   t  -tests were used to assess the contrasts between two conditions in the CS and NH groups separately. Two-sample   t  -tests were used for a direct comparison of the same contrasts between CS and NH participants. Additionally, conjunction null analyses ( ;  ) were used to identify the brain areas commonly activated between conditions or between CS and NH groups in contrasts of interest. This method tests whether individual effects are jointly significant, under the null hypothesis that all-but-one of the effects are significant, hence an “AND” over several individual hypotheses. ReML estimates of variance components were used to allow possible departure from the sphericity assumptions in RFX conjunction analyses ( ). 

In order to explore the role of MT/V5 region to the experimental conditions (see below, p 21), psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses ( ;  ) were computed to test the hypothesis that experimental conditions modulate functional connectivity between neural activity in left or right MT/V5 areas and other brain regions involved in CS and AV processing. First, the time course of activity within MT/V5 area was extracted separately at left and right MT/V5 coordinates for each individual. To do so, the CSLM (respectively speech AV) vs. still contrast effect (corresponding to the summary statistic images entered in the RFX analysis) was computed at the individual level, and the local maximum of activation determined in a volume within the probabilistic map of MT/V5, as identified in a previous cytoarchitectonic analysis ( ). This peak value was selected, unless it was identified outside of the brain structure of interest upon visual inspection of the individual normalized anatomical T1 image and verification of localization in SPM toolbox Anatomy atlas ( ), in which case the maximum value that fitted the anatomical location was selected. Second, a new linear model was generated for each individual level, using three regressors. One regressor represented the task condition (CSLM [respectively speech AV] vs. still). The second regressor was the average activity in a sphere (radius 4 mm) centered on the coordinate of the participant-specific peak value. The third regressor represented the interaction of interest between the first (psychological) and the second (physiological) regressor. To build this regressor, the underlying neuronal activity was first estimated by a parametric empirical Bayes formulation, combined with the psychological factor (i.e., task condition) and subsequently convolved with the hemodynamic response function ( ). The design matrix also included the movement parameters caused by subject movements. A significant PPI indicated a change in the regression coefficients between any reported brain area and the reference region related to the task condition. Individual summary statistic images obtained at the first level (fixed effects) analysis were then spatially smoothed (6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel) and entered into a second-level (RFXs) analysis using one sample   t  -tests to test for condition-specific effects within CS or NH group separately. 

Additionally, we performed an integration analysis, in which we searched for brain areas more strongly activated in a bi-articulatory condition (e.g., CSLM) than in the mono-articulatory conditions (e.g., CSM and CSL), during which only one of the two components was manipulated. This criterion of super-additivity ( ) was implemented as a t-contrast between the bi-articulatory condition and the sum of the two mono-articulatory conditions [e.g., CSLM > (CSM + CSL)]. For the CS group, the null hypothesis was thus a weighted contrast [2 -1 -1] such as [2 (mean activity during CSLM)] vs. [mean activity during CSM + mean activity during CSL]. For the NH group, the null hypothesis was [2 (mean activity during speech AV)] vs. [mean activity during speech auditory + mean activity during speech visual]. This comparison was masked inclusively by contrasts computed in the mono-articulatory conditions (e.g., CSM > still and CSL > still). This procedure indicated regions mainly devoted to integration while controlling for movement-related activity from manual cues and lipreading. This latter aspect is important since lip movements may have influenced activation results in simple subtraction analyses (e.g., CSLM-still). 

In all of the analyses presented above, the resulting set of voxel values for each contrast constituted a map of the t-statistic [SPM(T)], at   p   < 0.001 threshold (uncorrected for multiple comparisons). Statistical inferences were then obtained after corrections at the voxel level using Gaussian random field theory ( ),   p  < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons in the whole brain volume, unless otherwise specified. 

Anatomical localization of local maxima and clusters was assessed with reference to the MNI space, using standard anatomical atlases ( ). MT/V5 is a functional area that was located using a probabilistic map in the Anatomy SPM Toolbox ( ;  ). 



## Results 
  
### Behavioral Data 
  
The target detection of the word “papa” was accurate in both groups for all experimental conditions. In the CS group the mean performance was 100%, 99.1% (  SD   = 3.34) and 96.4% (  SD   = 5.8) in the CSLM, CSM and CSL conditions respectively. In the NH group, the mean performance was 100%, 95% (  SD   = 11.3) and 91% (  SD   = 19.5) in the speech AV, speech auditory and speech visual conditions respectively. The mean performance for the detection of the small circle in the control still task was 91% (  SD   = 12.9) in the CS group and 95% (  SD   = 11.7) in the NH group. The mean global performance was 98.5% in the deaf-CS group and 95.3% in the NH group. There was no significant difference between groups (  t   = 1.07; n.s.). 


### fMRI Data 
  
#### Brain Activation during CS Processing: CSLM-Still (Deaf) 
  
In CS participants, CSLM perception elicited higher blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses than the control (still) condition bilaterally in the occipito-temporal junction including the MT/V5 area, and in the middle and superior temporal lobe with a more extended activation in the left than in the right hemisphere. The activation in the superior temporal lobe did not include the primary auditory cortex (Heschl’s gyrus). Other areas activated within this contrast (CSLM-still) were the left inferior parietal lobe, the premotor area, and the inferior frontal gyrus,   pars triangularis   (BA 45). 


#### Brain Activation during Speech AV Processing: Speech AV-Still (Hearing) 
  
In NH participants, speech AV perception elicited greater BOLD responses than the control condition in bilateral superior and middle temporal gyri, including primary auditory cortex (Heschl’s gyrus), as well as in bilateral inferior parietal lobe and left inferior frontal gyrus,   pars triangularis   (  Figure    and   Table   ).

#### Overlapping Brain Activations: A Conjunction Analysis of CSLM and Speech AV Processing 
  
A conjunction analysis revealed a common activation pattern for AV speech (NH group) and CSLM (CS group) bilaterally in the middle and superior temporal gyrus (excluding Heschl’s gyrus) and in the left inferior frontal gyrus   pars triangularis   (  Figure    and   Table   ), indicating that, as in speech AV perception, CSLM perception is associated with neural activation in the secondary auditory cortices despite a complete absence of auditory input.

#### Differences in Brain Activation between CSLM and Speech AV Word Processing: A Two Sample   t  -test Analysis 
  
In comparing the speech AV and CSLM networks, we found greater BOLD responses in the CSLM (CS group) than in the speech AV (NH group) condition bilaterally in the occipito-temporal junction (MT/V5) and neighboring structures, with a greater extension in volume in the left hemisphere. Greater activations for speech AV than CSLM was found in the right middle temporal gyrus and the left superior temporal gyrus including Heschl’s gyrus (  Figure    and   Table   ). 


#### Is MT/V5 Involved in Speech Processing? Psychophysiological Interaction Analysis (PPI) in MT/V5 for CSLM and Speech AV Word Processing 
  
The results shown above indicate that besides large commonalities, the neural basis of speech perception in CSLM in CS participants is shifted toward posterior regions of the brain as compared to speech AV in NH participants, with activation peaks in the occipito-temporal junction and MT/V5. Admittedly, activation in MT/V5 is associated with visual motion processing ( ;  ;  ), which was present in the CSLM but not in the control still condition. To test further whether activation in MT/V5 was associated specifically with processing of CSLM, a PPI analysis was performed with MT/V5 (left and right) as source area and CSLM vs. still condition as modulatory parameters. Results revealed increased connectivity during CSLM perception as compared to the still condition between the   left MT/V5   and temporal lobes in both hemispheres, as well as with the posterior inferior temporal and fusiform gyrus bilaterally (  Figure    and   Table   ).

Psychophysiological Interactions from left and right MT/V5 in NH and CS groups, related to   Figure   . 
    
Increased connectivity between left MT/V5 and temporal regions typically activated for speech processing suggests that left MT/V5 interacts with regions playing a role during CSLM perception.   Right MT/V5   was associated more strongly with CSLM in more posterior brain regions, including the middle occipital and fusiform gyri bilaterally, the left MT/V5 and superior parietal lobe, the right inferior occipital and posterior middle temporal gyri, and the right inferior parietal lobe. 

Similar PPI analyses conducted in the NH group revealed a higher connectivity during speech AV than still condition between the left MT/V5 and a small left middle temporal region (  Figure    and   Table   ). 


#### Where Does Integration of Manual Cues and Lipreading in CSLM Take Place? Super-Additivity Analysis of Speech AV and CSLM Word Processing 
  
We performed analyses to identify the brain regions responding more strongly to bi-articulation (CSLM in the CS group; speech AV in the NH group) than to the sum of the mono-articulation stimulus presentation (e.g., CSM and CSL separately). The integration analysis in the NH group [speech AV – (speech auditory + speech visual)] revealed greater activity in the bilateral posterior superior and middle temporal gyri (  Figure    and   Table   ). This result is in agreement with findings from previous studies of spoken language that have shown that integration between lipreading and auditory speech takes place in the pSTS ( ;  ;  , but see  ). It is hypothesized that the particular sensitivity of this area for multimodal speech integration arises from a correlation between the dynamic aspects of   seen   lipreading and   heard   auditory speech ( ).

In the CS group, the integration analysis [i.e., CSLM ≥ (CSM + CSL)] revealed a supplementary activation in the left occipito-temporal junction only, around the MT/V5 area (  Figure    and   Table   ). This is the same location as the activation peak in the CSLM ≥ still condition (see   Figure    and   Table   ). This finding further suggests that the left occipito-temporal junction, including MT/V5, supports the integration of lipread and manual speech features, above a mere visual processing of motion input.

#### Importance of Labial and Manual Information? Comparison of Two Conjunction Analyses Within CS: CSM – CSLM and CSL – CSLM 
  
Finally, we wondered whether one source of information is more important in CSLM perception for deaf CS users, as for AV speech in hearing people. Indeed, the primary processing of information in speech AV decoding comes from the auditory source, whereas the contribution of visual speech to the final percept directly depends on the ambiguity of the auditory information ( ). In CSLM production, it has been demonstrated that the manual cues movement anticipates the lip movements, and that this anticipation is used by the CS-perceivers to reduce the uncertainty about the phonemes pronounced ( ,  ;  ). This suggests the possibility that manual cues are dominant in CSLM processing, while lipreading would have a (secondary) role associated to the disambiguation of the percept. 

A conjunction analysis between CSLM and the CSM conditions was performed and revealed widely overlapping neural activity, especially in the bilateral occipito-temporal junction, the left superior and middle temporal and inferior parietal lobes (  Figure    and   Table   ).

The number of overlapping voxels in this conjunction represented 94% of the voxels activated in the CSLM network. Conversely, the conjunction analysis between CSLM and CSL conditions revealed a low overlap with only 25% of the CSLM network activated (mostly in the left middle temporal gyrus). Although this observation of higher overlap with the CSLM network was made at the descriptive level only, these conclusions are reinforced by subtraction analyses that failed to reveal significant differences between CSLM and CSM conditions, whereas extended, higher activation in the CSLM than in the CSL condition was found in the bilateral occipito-temporal junction. The great overlapping activity of CSLM and CSM might be linked to the common kinematic signature created by the movements in hands. However, our results may also suggest that the processing of manual cues might play a primary (dominant) role in CSLM decoding, while lipreading may play a second role. This makes CSLM even more akin to speech AV processing : similar analyses computed in the NH group revealed a high similarity between processing of speech AV and speech auditory conditions (68% overlap), but not between speech AV and lipreading (10% overlap), and subtractions showed larger differences between speech AV and lipreading conditions (  Figure    and   Table   ).

## Discussion 
  
The current study compared the fMRI activations of CS processing by deaf participants with that of speech AV processing by hearing participants, with identical spoken words, presented either in CS (i.e., lipreading and manual cues) for deaf CS participants (CS group) or audio-visually for normally hearing participants (NH group). Both groups of participants had French as their native language. Our study is the first neuroimaging investigation of deaf people who had full sensory access to the phonemic and syllabic content of spoken speech, through the visual modality. 

Our first research question concerned the similarities and differences between the processing of CSLM by early CS-users and the processing of speech AV speech by hearing participants. Our results show that the perception of oral language delivered through CSLM activates secondary auditory cortices in the MTG and STG together with IPL. This activation represents most of the overlapping activation regions found during CSLM and AV speech processing (see   Figure    and   Table   ). In AV speech processing, MTG and STG are parts of a structure in the auditory ventral stream ( ) that serves as an interface between sound based representations of speech ( ), visual speech (see   for a review) and widely distributed conceptual representations ( ). However, in CSLM, activity in MTG and STG cannot be linked to any kind of acoustic processing. Since earlier studies showed a very accurate CS perception and comprehension in deaf early CS users ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), activation of the secondary auditory cortex might be linked to an interface between phonetic visual speech codes conveyed by lip movements/manual cues and conceptual representations. 

Differences in brain activation between CSLM and AV speech showed that the neural basis of speech perception in CSLM is shifted toward posterior regions of the brain (parieto-occipital regions) as compared to AV. Some studies have reported more posterior language processing in less experienced language users, deaf ( ) and not deaf ( ;  ). However, our CS participants were exposed to visual representation of spoken language as their native language. Our deaf participants had all a good level of comprehension of CS (see participants). This suggests that activations presented here are not the consequence of poor language processing. 

Interestingly, the common component of the speech AV and CSLM brain networks is located in the posterior portion of the STG. In contrast, the anterior part of STG (including the auditory primary cortex) is   only   activated in AV speech processing (see   Figure    and   Table   ). We surmise here a functional subdivision of the superior temporal lobe for speech processing, with the anterior part supporting speech processing based on sounds (i.e., phonetic codes), and the posterior portion involved in speech processing integrating information provided by different modalities (visual, auditory, and even somatosensory). Indeed, previous studies have shown that the multisensory posterior STG can be involved either in acoustic-phonetic processing ( ), in phonological mediation for lipreading ( ) or in simultaneous auditory-tactile stimulation ( ). Moreover, activation of STG also appeared during SL processing in deaf people suggesting that neural activity in posterior STG is linked to linguistic processing beyond auditory representation ( ;  ;  ). The present findings also indicate that the multisensory posterior STG could be activated by the processing of language cues   within a single modality   (here: visual), at least when these visual cues provide meaning for the individual as it was the case with the words presented in this experiment. Given previous findings showing that the posterior STG is activated when participants observe symbolic gestures ( ), our data support the hypothesis that this region responds to meaningful manual-lipread stimuli in deaf CS-users as well as vocal-auditory stimuli in hearing AV participants. Our results thus provide converging evidence with these previous neuroimaging studies, but also add the new information about involvement of posterior STG in the processing of CSLM. Finally, there is a greater activation of occipital gyrus in CSLM compared to AV. This might reflect the greater kinematic information supplied by the hands and lip movement in CS. 

It should be noted that activation in posterior STG during CSLM processing could also be explained by the fact that our CS participants were all deaf. These two interpretations are not easy to disentangle.   showed that cortical plasticity resulting from deafness depends on language experience for auditory and visual areas. If normally hearing participants who are CS-users (parents, teachers, educators of deaf CS-users) also showed activation of posterior STS, the hypothesis that multi-signal integration inside the visual modality occurs in this region of the brain would be reinforced. 

Our second research question concerned the neural basis of integration of manual cues and lipread information. In CSLM, the integration is mandatory and concerns two types of dynamic information in the visual modality (i.e., visible movement of the labial and manual articulators). In contrast, in AV speech, integration concerns information in two different modalities: auditory and visual. Our integration analysis suggests that left MT/V5 plays a role in the integration of lipread and manual CS information. Note that this region has been already linked to speech processing ( ;  ) and to processing of visual movements in SL ( ). In addition, it has been shown that use of a visuospatial language like SL impacts the recruitment of the MT/V5 during motion visual processing. Deaf and hearing signers show a greater activation of the left MT/V5 than the right, while hearing non-signers show the opposite pattern ( ;  ), indicating that lateralization of MT/V5 is sensitive to language experience. Given that speech input in CS is primarily perceived through visual occipital networks, one may surmise that integration in the MT/V5 area is an early step in CSLM processing. This conception seems logical considering that manual cues and lips cues need to be processed before unambiguous decoding of speech ( ). Importantly, our integration analysis, unlike the other analyses (e.g., subtractions) conducted in this study, controls for perception of movements related to CS production, since the comparison is made between CSLM and the sum of manual cues and lipreading. However, we cannot firmly conclude that integration occurring in MT/V5 is   linguistic   because some (or even all) of this integration might be non-linguistic, or even attentional ( ). To support the hypothesis of a linguistic integration in MT/V5, future studies should compare these activation patterns with those coming from a control group that does not use or understand CS, presented with the same set of stimuli. In relation to the role of MT/V5 during CSLM perception, our PPI analyses yielded increased connectivity between left MT/V5 and speech processing regions located in the left temporal lobe. This suggests a cooperative activity between these areas in the treatment of CS components. 

In addition, PPI analysis showed a functional inter-hemispheric differentiation in CS users: left MT/V5 interacts with left temporal lobes linked to speech processing whereas right MT/V5 interacts mostly with occipital areas, including left MT/V5, linked to visual perception and motion processing. 

Our third research question concerned the relative activation created by CSM and by CSL compared to the activation created by CSLM. If the manual cues play a leading role in the processing of CSLM, one could expect a greater overlap between the activation created by the CSM and CS conditions, compared to a lower overlap between the activation created by CSL and CSLM. The conjunction analyses between CSLM and CSM conditions, on the one hand, and CSLM and CSL conditions on the other hand may be associated to a dominant role for the manual cues. Indeed, the almost complete overlap between CSLM and CSM networks is compatible with the view that the manual cues first provide phonological information, and lipreading intervenes subsequently in order to further disambiguate the linguistic message. This conclusion is in good agreement with three types of behavioral data. First, temporal analyses of CS production have shown that manual cues are produced temporally in advance to the lips ( ,  ;  ). Second, when lipreading and manual cues are incongruent (e.g., pronouncing with the lips the phoneme /v/ with handshape 1 coding /d/, /p/ /j/ phonemes), most of the answers from the perceiver are related to the manual cues and not to lipreading, especially when the participant is an early CS user ( ;  ,  ). Third, deaf people who are early CS-users often succeed in daily natural communication with other CS users by producing manual cues alone, without lipreading. In this case, the full meaning of the message would be completed by the context ( ). While the set of manual cues was initially originally created with the aim of disambiguating lipreading ( ), the present data support the hypothesis that   it is lipreading which disambiguates manual cues  , thus presenting a   topsy-turvy   vision of CS ( ). One possible reason for this phenomenon is that in speech processing the perceiver takes a “preference” for decoding from those elements that are perceptually most distinguishable (i.e., the manual cues in CS for deaf participants or audio in AV for hearing participants). In case of deaf CS perceivers, it must also kept in mind that manual CS cues are executed and visually available to the perceiver a very short time before lip movements ( ). At this step one could not also exclude that prior hand cues may reduce ambiguity before mouth shapes processing. 

Interestingly, manual cues were associated with increased activity in left superior and middle temporal gyrus (  Figure    and   Table   ), a brain zone typically activated during the processing of natural languages like spoken languages and signed languages. However, manual cues are completely artificial gestures, not resulting from any evolutionary process. This suggests that invented manual gestures that convey linguistic information may become processed in the same areas as other articulatory gestures previously integrated in the human language through the natural evolutionary process of communication. 

These findings should be investigated in further studies to better understand the degree of dependency of language processing on speech features. For example, in order to better determine the brain areas subtending speech processing, one could conduct a similar study of speech perception, which would use a control condition containing pseudospeech movements through manual cues and lips, instead of a still control condition. The pseudospeech would be phonologically plausible but meaningless. This condition would enable us to dissociate brain areas linked to phonological processing from those linked to lexical processing in visual CS. Another interesting study would be to investigate the neural correlates of incongruent lip and manual cue movements (for example, a mouthed syllable /va/ accompanied by handshape 1 [/p, d, j/]), i.e., a McGurk-like effect experiment ( ;  ,  ). In CS, this would increase our understanding of the integration of visual speech features in deaf participants. Finally, we are interested in examining how manual cues are integrated with AV speech in deaf people fitted with a cochlear implant ( ,  ). As mentioned, the articulatory movement of the hand precedes the mouth opening and the emission of sound and may therefore predict aspects of the lipread and the auditory signals, especially when the AV signal is ambiguous (e.g., visual /k/). The amount and nature of visual information extracted from the hand may initiate the speech-processing system, in which an abstract representation is activated through visual inputs, up to the point of explicitly registering auditory input. If this speculation appears to be correct, it means that processing of CS gestures could help deaf children fitted with a cochlear implant to discriminate, identify or interpret the new arriving sounds. Integration across modalities would allow the STG to help individuals with cochlear implants in discrimination, identification or interpreting the ambiguous auditory cues delivered by the cochlear implant. 

At a more general level, our data about the neural processing of CS increase our general knowledge on how do deaf native users of CS process visual speech information. Compared to normally hearing individuals, deaf native users of spoken language have fewer areas of anatomical differences than do deaf native users of ASL ( ). The neural processes involved in CS and in AV speech seem, to a certain extent, also similar. 


## Conclusion 
  
In this article, we report results from the first neuroimaging study of CS processing, a mode of communication in which the syllables and phonemes of a spoken language are conveyed solely through the visual modality in the absence of either speech or hearing. First, we found that activation patterns in the secondary auditory cortex (i.e., temporal lobes) in visual CS perception and speech AV perception confirm the existence of a common language brain system for spoken languages, regardless of the sensory input modality. Second, our PPI and integration analyses suggest that MT/V5, a region classically associated with visual motion processing, exerts an active influence on the integration of hands and mouth. However, based on our analysis, we cannot conclude that this integration is merely linguistic. Finally, findings from our study suggest that the manual cues may dominate in the speech perception of skilled CS.

# Title

Strategic Motives Drive Proposers to Offer Fairly in Ultimatum Games: An fMRI Study

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
The hypothesis of strategic motives postulates that offering fairly in the Ultimatum Game (UG) is to avoid rejection and receive money. In this fMRI study, we used a modified UG to elucidate how proposers reached decisions of offering fairly and to what extent they considered offering selfishly with different stakes. We had proposers choose between a fair and a selfish offer with different degrees of selfishness and stake sizes. Proposers were less likely and spent more time choosing the fair offer over a slightly-selfish offer than a very selfish offer independent of stakes. Such choices evoked greater activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortices that typically involve in allocation of cognitive control for cost/benefit decision making. Choosing a fair offer in higher stakes evoked greater activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACCg) and the areas that previously have been implicated in reward and theory of mind. Furthermore, choosing a slightly selfish offer over a fair offer evoked greater activation in the anterior cingulate sulcus, ACCg, ventral tegmental area (or substantia nigra) and anterior insular cortex signalling the higher gain and implying higher rejection risk. In conclusion, our findings favoured the hypothesis that proposers offer fairly based on the strategic motives.

## Introduction 
  
Consider a bargaining environment in which there is a proposer, a recipient and a certain amount of money (i.e. stakes) to be divided between two players. The proposer proposes how to share the sum and the recipient can either accept or reject the proposal. If the recipient accepts the proposal, the money is divided as proposed, whereas both players receive nothing in the case of rejection. This game is known as the ultimatum game (UG) . Although simple, it is important because it has many real-world analogies (such as wage bargaining between a union and the CEO) and helps crystallize more complex bargaining situations. 

According to the standard economic theory of self-interest, the recipient accepts any offer greater than zero, and the proposer offers the lowest amount possible . However, experimental studies have provided robust evidence that recipients and proposers take actions that are inconsistent with the theoretical prediction. The majority of proposers share equally and offer approximately 40% of the stakes on average, whereas recipients routinely reject offers ≤20% of the stakes . Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain why proposers distribute money in a relatively fair manner . 

The first hypothesis suggests that proposers care about the welfare of others and behave generously out of altruistic motives . Previous studies examined this hypothesis by comparing the proposing behaviours between the UG and the dictator game (DG) , in which the recipient can merely accept the proposal . This hypothesis predicts that proposers would also offer fairly in the DG. However, proposers were found to offer less in the DG (i.e. approximately 23% of the stakes) than that in the UG. 

Only two recent studies have examined the neural correlates of the proposing behaviours between the UG and the DG using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) . Neither study used the original UG task, in which proposers can freely indicate their offer. Instead, they asked participants to choose one preferred offer among several (i.e. 6:6, 7:5, 8:4, 9:3, 10:2 or 11:1 in splitting 12 cents; see ref.  ) or to choose between a fair offer and a selfish offer with different degrees of selfishness (i.e. ¥5: ¥5 vs. ¥7: ¥3 or ¥8: ¥2; see ref.  ). Weiland   et al  .  reported that fair offers in the UG induce greater activation in the striatum than that of the DG, which is involved in reward expectancy and magnitude, suggesting that UG proposers are mainly driven by egotistic motives that emphasize reward. Zheng and Zhu  reported that the same contrast induces greater activation in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left cingulate gyrus. These two areas have been found to engage in making inferences about other people’s mental state and emotional experiences, respectively , suggesting that fair UG offers may be the results of inferring the recipient’s responses. 

Strategic motives are the second main hypothesis, postulating that a fair offer is made to avoid the possibility of rejection and receive a monetary reward . This hypothesis has been used to explain why raising stakes has no marked effect on the proposing behaviour . That is, offering fairly, regardless of the stakes, is the safest solution in which the possibility of rejection is almost zero and proposers will be guaranteed half the stakes. In cases where proposers were explicitly informed that recipients would receive any offer greater than zero, they offered much less (i.e. 25% of the stakes) and even less when the stakes were raised . In other words, proposers made an offer mainly driven after deliberating on the recipient’s answer. 

One important limitation in most previous studies was that only the final proposed offer was observed: participants were asked to divide the money by freely indicating their proposal (e.g. refs  ,  ,  ) or choosing one preferred offer among several offers with different share sizes, such as offering 20%, 30% or 50% of the stakes to the recipient (e.g. refs  ,  ,  ). However, how proposers reached the final decision of ‘offering fairly’ and to what extent they considered a selfish offer remains poorly understood. To tackle this issue, we followed Zheng and Zhu  by using a modified UG in which proposers had to make a binary choice between a fair offer and a selfish offer. Specifically, we manipulated the share size of the selfish offer systematically to be 10%, 20%, 30% or 40% of the stakes rather than either 20% or 30% of the stakes as tested by Zheng and Zhu . This manipulation gave us the opportunity to approximate the threshold of a selfish offer that proposers might have considered even though they ended up making a fair offer. We also manipulated stake size to investigate whether raising the stake size would have no marked effect in our modified UG as reported for the classical UG (e.g. ref.  ). Importantly, we conducted the experiment using fMRI and measured the time that proposers needed to make a choice. Therefore, we were able to examine the UG proposing behaviour at various levels, including the decisions (fair/selfish offers), reaction times and neural correlates. 

If the proposers were driven primarily by strategic motives in our modified UG, as suggested in the literature (e.g. refs  ,  ,  ), their proposed offer would be altered by the paired selfish offer given the corresponding possibility of rejection and the potential monetary reward. A very selfish offer had a higher possibility of rejection than a fair offer; therefore, proposers might anticipate rejection when choosing between a fair and a very selfish offer and be inclined to choose the fair offer without much hesitation. In contrast, a slightly selfish offer is more amicable and acceptable to recipients than a very selfish offer, even though it also favours the proposers. Therefore, proposers might consider choosing the slightly selfish offer because it is more lucrative than a fair offer but somehow acceptable. Specifically, we expected that proposers would hesitate more and, thus, take longer making a decision when they had to choose between a fair offer and a slightly selfish offer than if they had to choose between a fair offer and a very selfish offer. In the neural level, we expected that proposers would show greater activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which has been reported to be involved in social decision making . Specifically, we expected that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortices (dACC; Brodmann areas [BA] 24 and 32) would be more activated as it has been found to play a central role in decisions about the allocation of cognitive control based on a cost/benefit analysis (review see ref.  ). 

We expected to observe greater activation additionally in the mesolimbic region (i.e. ventral tegmental area [VTA] in the midbrain, ventral striatum [vST] and their reciprocally connected frontal cortex) signalling the greater monetary reward when proposers chose the slightly selfish offer over the fair offer . Such risk-taking behaviour might be reflected from greater activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of the vST , the insular cortex  and the orbitofrontal cortex  as reported in economic decision-making studies. 

It has been suggested that proposers are more risk averse and more sensitive to the risk of rejection when stakes are higher due to the greater potential monetary gains and losses . Thus, we expected that proposers would take longer to consider the recipient’s answer even though they eventually chose the fair offer in a higher stakes situation. Particularly, we expected to observe greater activation in mesolimbic region signalling with greater potential monetary gains and losses and in regions that previously have been implicated in risk-averse attitudes, such as the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex . We expected that the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACCg) would also activate more as it has been found to associate with the value of rewards for others . Moreover, it would be of great interest to examine whether proposers are more likely to spend a shorter amount of time choosing the fair offer over a more selfish offer, particularly when the stakes are higher. 

In fact, the UG proposing behaviour has been rarely studied compared to the responding behaviour. It has been commonly assumed that rejection of selfish offers by recipients reflects negative emotional arousal mediated by the anterior insular cortex (AIC) and ACC . Thus, the findings of the current study will be a great contribution to the existing literature and could help elucidate the neural correlates of the proposing behaviour as revealed by previous behavioural research (e.g. refs  – ).

### Overall choices with different share and stake sizes: estimated proportion of fair offers 
  
The estimated logistic model showed a significant main effect of share size,   χ   (3, 42) = 53.522,   p   < 0.001. Participants were significantly more likely to choose fair offers when the other choice was more selfish (estimated proportion of 0.59 ± 0.049, 0.79 ± 0.037, 0.90 ± 0.024 and 0.92 ± 0.019 when the other choice offered 40%, 30%, 20% and 10% of the stakes, respectively). Post-hoc analyses indicated that all pairs of comparisons were significant (odds ratios were 0.106 and 0.280 for the comparisons between 40% and 10% and between 30% and 10%, respectively), except when the other choice offered 20% vs. 10% of the stakes (odds ratio = 0.753). The main effect of stake size,   χ   (1, 42) = 0.302,   p   = 0.583 (odds ratio = 0.718), and the interaction,   χ   (3, 42) = 2.430,   p   = 0.488, were not significant (see Fig.  ).

### Choice of a fair offer over a selfish offer with different share and stake sizes 
  
#### Behavioural results: response time (RT) of choices for a fair offer over a selfish offer with different share and stake sizes 
  
Similarly, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) detected a significant main effect of share size,   F   (1.742, 64.458) = 11.600,   p   < 0.001,   η   = 0.239. Proposers decreased the RT of choosing a fair offer when the other choice was more selfish (mean times, 1.591 ± 0.065, 1.458 ± 0.059, 1.399 ± 0.051 and 1.371 ± 0.047 s when the other choice offered 40%, 30%, 20% and 10% of the stakes, respectively). Post-hoc analyses indicated that all compared pairs were significant, except when the other choice offered 20% vs. 10% of the stakes and when the other choice offered 40% vs. 30% of the stakes. The main effect of stake size was also significant,   F   (1, 37) = 7.923,   p   < 0.01,   η   = 0.176. Proposers took longer for higher stakes, with mean values of 1.395 ± 0.056 and 1.479 ± 0.054 s for low and high stake sizes, respectively. No significant interaction was found,   F   (1.893, 70.057) = 0.885,   p   = 0.412,   η   = 0.023 (see Fig.  ). A trend analysis showed that the relationship between RT and share size of the selfish offer could be modelled by a linear trend,   F   (1, 37) = 16.378,   p   < 0.001,   η   = 0.307.

#### Imaging results 
  
First, choice of a fair offer over a slightly selfish offer induced greater activation in the medial frontal gyrus, including the bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA) and the dACC than choices of a fair offer over a very selfish offer (Table   and Fig.  ). The reverse contrast did not reveal any significant activation clusters. Second, choosing a fair offer with higher stakes induced greater activation in distributed regions that were more associated with two circuits, such as the mesolimbic system, including the VTA (or the substantia nigra [SN]) in the midbrain and the left pallidum in the vST and the theory of mind (ToM) , including the mPFC, bilateral precuneus and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ). In particular, the activated cluster in the mPFC was mostly in the ACCg. Additional clusters were also observed in bilateral occipital lobes and the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG)/precentral gyrus (Table   and Fig.  ). The reverse contrast and the interaction effects did not reveal any significant activation clusters.

### Choosing between a fair and a slightly selfish offer with different stake sizes 
  
#### Behavioural results 
  
Proportion of fair offers with different stake sizes: Proposers showed similar rates when choosing a fair offer with low and high stake sizes,   t   = −0.174,   p   = 0.863,   r   = 0.03, with mean rates of 60% and 62% for low and high stake sizes, respectively. 

RT of choices for a fair and a slightly selfish offer with different stake sizes: ANOVA detected no significant main effect of choice,   F   (1, 27) = 1.749,   p   = 0.197,   η   = 0.061, or stake size,   F   (1, 27) = 0.328,   p   = 0.572,   η   = 0.012, and no significant interaction,   F   (1, 27) = 1.530,   p   = 0.227,   η   = 0.054, with mean values of 1.592 ± 0.079, 1.654 ± 0.072, 1.704 ± 0.077 and 1.678 ± 0.094 s for choosing a fair offer with low stakes, a fair offer with high stakes, a slightly selfish offer with low stakes and a slightly selfish offer with high stakes, respectively. 


#### Imaging results 
  
As shown in Table   and Fig.  , choosing a slightly selfish offer induced greater activation in the mPFC than choosing a fair offer (mainly in the ACCg and partially in the anterior cingulate sulcus [ACCs]), and regions associated within the mesolimbic system, including the VTA (or the SN) in the midbrain and caudate and pallidum and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in the vST. The bilateral AIC and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), including the inferior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus also displayed greater activation. The other contrasts and the interaction effects did not reveal significant activation clusters.

## Discussion 
  
Proposers typically make a fair offer in the original UG , and our proposers also showed extremely high rates of choosing the fair offer when the other choice was very selfish in our modified UG. In contrast, when the choice was only slightly selfish, suggesting comparatively lower rejection risk than a very selfish offer, and the higher expected monetary reward than a fair offer, but somehow acceptable, the proposers showed much lower rates of choosing the fair offer. This result was consistent with previous findings . Moreover, our systematic manipulation of the share size of the paired selfish offer allowed us to investigate the rate of choosing a fair offer as share size of the paired selfish offer changes. We found that proposers increased their rates of choosing a fair offer as share size of the paired selfish offer decreased and, more importantly, they showed similar rates when the share sizes were 20% and 10%. Thus, a selfish offer, such as 20%, could be a threshold at which proposers no longer consider the offer, which corresponded perfectly with the threshold that recipients typically reject in the classical UG (e.g. ref.  ). This result suggests that proposers in our modified UG were putting themselves in the shoes of the recipient, and the format of our modified UG retained the essence of the original UG. 

Furthermore, the finding that proposers increased RT when choosing a fair offer as a function of share size of the paired selfish offer was new. Moreover, they spent similar time choosing a fair offer when the selfish offer was 40% vs. 30% and 20% vs. 10%. This result further provides justification for the way that we merged the imaging data of 40% and 30% as ‘slightly selfish offers’ and 20% and 10% as ‘very selfish offers’. When choosing between the fair and slightly selfish offers than a very selfish offer, proposers’ dACC was more activated. The dACC has been shown to relate to the allocation of cognitive control in making decisions considering the potential gains and losses . Moreover, it has been found to frequently engage in pre-response conflict and decision uncertainty that signals a reduced possibility of obtaining an anticipated reward . Furthermore, it has also been shown to signal a foregone reward for self . We also found greater activation in the rostral cingulate zone (BA 32), which has been shown to have direct and indirect projections and functional connectivity to the SMA and activate more when choosing between competing options in consideration of an anticipated reward associated with each of the options . Similarly, we found greater activation in the SMA, which has been reported to engage in motor control during goal-based action selection processes (i.e. choosing between a fair offer and a selfish offer) . 

An important contribution of this study was that we examined the behavioural and neural responses when proposers made a slightly selfish offer over a fair offer (as in the second subset of data analyses), which has never been reported in the literature. Proposers did not have different decision times when choosing between a fair and a slightly selfish offer or between splitting high and low stakes. The latter result was particularly interesting because proposers took longer for higher stakes when they chose a fair offer (as shown in our first subset of data analyses). The stake effect diminished when proposers chose the slightly selfish offer, suggesting that proposers may have used different considerations when making fair and selfish offers. However, the different sample sizes and data inclusion between the two subsets of data analyses could also make this difference. 

Choosing a slightly selfish offer induced greater activation in the mPFC than choosing a fair offer (mostly in the ACCg and partly in the ACCs), implying a greater consideration of the rewards for one self and the other (recipient) (e.g. refs  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Regions within the mesolimbic system (including the VTA or the SN in the midbrain and the left pallidum in the vST) were also more activated, possibly signalling the potential higher value when choosing the selfish offer (e.g. ref.  ). 

Moreover, greater activation was also found in the bilateral AIC. It has been suggested that AIC functions should be inferred with co-activated regions because the AIC is associated with a broad range of functions linked to emotions and homeostatic regulation . The co-activated regions involved in the reward circuit imply representation of reward anticipation by the AIC . Moreover, co-activated regions, such as NAcc in the vST, imply that the activation in the AIC might be related to the representation of risk level for a slightly selfish offer because it was more likely to be rejected than a fair offer . Alternatively, greater activation in the AIC might also associate with negative emotion expression or regulation due to the consideration of choosing a slightly selfish offer over a fair offer. Such an interpretation addresses processing of negative emotion as reported by Sanfey   et al  .  that UG recipients display greater activation in their bilateral AIC for an unfair offer than a fair offer, as a symbol of negative emotion, such as disgust at a disrespectfully selfish offer. Last, the higher activation in the VLPFC might be related to cognitive control and response inhibition because choosing a slightly selfish offer was more rewarding but also riskier than choosing a fair offer . It would be interesting for future studies to use the AIC as a region of interest to investigate the psychological processing of proposers and recipients to better understand their different concerns, such as self-interest and fairness. 

In this study we also examined the effect of stake size, and not surprisingly, we replicated previous findings that stake size did not significantly alter the proposed offer (e.g. ref.  ). Moreover, we provided new evidence that proposers took longer to choose the fair offer when the stakes were higher. It is also possible that proposers took longer when the stakes were higher because higher stakes involve more math skills (e.g. to calculate the percentage of the selfish offer to total stakes). However, after cancelling out the effect of RT in our imaging data with the parametric modulation analysis, proposers still showed greater activation in the brain regions that have been previously shown to associate with reward and ToM . Notably, higher stakes also elicited greater activation in the ACCg, which has been reported to signal rewards delivering to others . Taken together, these imaging results might imply that proposers deliberated over the recipients’ answers to a greater extent when stakes were higher due to the higher potential gains and losses. One limitation of the current study was that stake size may not have been high enough to make a difference on choices. Future studies should test proposing behaviour changes when stake size is extremely high. 

It is worthwhile to compare our results with previous meta-analyses findings of responding behaviour during the UG . Previous studies reported that recipients showed greater activation in the bilateral mid-anterior insula, bilateral anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), left anterior SMA and right cerebellum when facing an unfair compared to a fair offer. They also indicated that recipients had greater activities in the SMA, aMCC, right MFG and bilateral lentiform nucleus when rejecting an unfair offer rather than when they accepted an offer. Activation in the mPFC/ACC while proposing a fair offer and rejecting an unfair offer is in line with the view that this region reflects rewards of decisions during social interactions . 

The present study complemented the current literature as there are only two fMRI studies that investigated UG proposing behaviours to any extent . Weiland   et al  .  attempted to investigate UG proposing behaviour but were constrained by the very unbalanced number of choices between fair and selfish offers. The division of fair and selfish offers could also be debated because the offer of 7:5 was considered the fair offer when contrasting fair offers (i.e. offers of 6:6 and 7:5) vs. selfish offers (i.e. offers of 8:4, 9:3, 10:2 and 11:1). Moreover, their UG data were obtained from only 14 participants. Therefore, their results should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, Zheng and Zhu  did not compare fair and selfish offers. 

In conclusion, in our modified UG, proposers were less likely and spent more time choosing the fair offer over a slightly-selfish offer than a very selfish offer independent of stakes, possibly because a slightly selfish offer was more lucrative than a fair offer but somehow acceptable to the recipient. Such choices induced greater activation in the dACC that typically engage in allocation of cognitive control for cost/benefit decision making. Furthermore, choosing a fair offer in higher stakes evoked greater activation in the ACCg that signal the rewards for the other person and the areas that previously have been implicated in reward and ToM. These results might imply that in higher stakes participants deliberated on recipients’ answers due to higher potential gains and losses. Last, choosing a slightly selfish offer over a fair offer evoked greater activation in the ACCs, ACCg, VTA (or SN), and AIC, tracking rewards for oneself and the other person as well as signalling a higher value and a greater rejection risk In sum, we have provided a comprehensive picture of UG proposing behaviour from various aspects. Our behavioural and imaging findings favoured the hypothesis of strategic motives for fair UG offers, which assumes that a fair offer is made to avoid rejection and receive reward. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Forty-five participants (27 females and 18 males; mean age = 24.49 ± 2.70 years) were recruited. All participants were healthy, right-handed (assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory; Oldfield 1971, see ref.  ) and without any neurological or psychiatric disorders or contraindications to MRI. They were matched with another 45 participants who acted as recipients to accept or reject their proposals. Prior to the experiment, all participants gave written informed consent to the study. All methods were performed in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the institutional review board on Humanities & Social Science Research/IRB-HS at Academia Sinica. 


### Task, Stimuli and Procedure 
  
We explained our modified UG task to the participants before testing, and the participants completed eight practice trials. We informed the participants that another participant would be selected randomly to play the role of recipient and respond to their offers (160 trials in total) in the UG in the other study. Participants did not meet the recipients and did not know who they would be matched with. 

We told participants that two trials would be selected randomly out of all testing trials and that they would receive money based on the matched recipients’ answers to their proposed offer. The average amount of money that they received from the two selected trials was NT$901 ± NT$452 (range, NT$0 – NT$1740; exchange rate between NT$ and US$ was approximately 33:1). This amount of money was approximately eight times the minimum wage per hour in Taiwan. Because most of the participants were college students, we assumed that such an amount could be an incentive for them to get as much money as possible. Moreover, they received NT$500 as a participation fee. 

Participants were presented with a fixation cross for 2 or 4 s during each trial, and then a stake with two pairs of choices of a fair offer and a selfish offer. Participants had to choose one pair of choices by pressing the button with their left or right thumb in 4 s; otherwise the trial would be skipped. No feedback was given, so we could observe participants’ original proposing behaviour without being influenced by the immediate answer of the recipient. The jittered inter-trial interval (ITI) was 2, 4, 6, or 8 s (Fig.  ). The high stakes ranged from NT$1640 to NT$2360 with an average of NT$2000 and a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.098. The low stake ranged from NT$164 to NT$236 with an average of NT$200 and the same CV value. The fixed CV of the two stake sizes ensured that the differences among the four levels of the share size were consistent for the two stake sizes. The fair offer was offering 50% of the stake to the recipient, and the selfish offer was offering 40%, 30%, 20% or 10% of the stake. The position (left vs. right) of the fair vs. selfish offer choices was randomised, and the position (left vs. right) of the money assigned to the two players in the offer choice was counterbalanced among participants. Each experimental condition (2 stake sizes × 4 share sizes) was tested in 20 repetitions, yielding a total of 160 trials divided into four runs. Participants also received a 6 min anatomical scan. The entire experiment took approximately 1 hr. The experimental program was written using MATLAB2008 (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) with Psychotoolbox 2.5.4. The choices, RTs, and brain images were recorded.   
Timeline of an exemplar trial. In each trial, participants had to choose between a fair offer and a very selfish offer (i.e., offering 10% of the stake to the recipient) in a low stake. 
  


### Data Acquisition 
  
MRI images were collected using a 32-channel head coil in a 3T scanner (Skyra, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). A T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo planar imaging sequence was used for fMRI scanning, with 3 mm slice thickness, 256 × 256 mm  field of view, 90° flip angle, 34 slices, 2000 ms repetition time (TR), and 30 ms echo time (TE). The anatomical, T1-weighted high-resolution image (1 × 1 × 1 mm ) was acquired using a standard MPRAGE sequence, with a 7° flip angle, 2,530 ms TR, 3.3 ms TE and 1,100 ms inversion time (TI). 


### Data Analysis 
  
Among the 45 participants, two (participants 18 and 34) were excluded from the data analysis because they fell asleep in the MRI scanner during the experiment. For imaging analysis, only participants without excessive head movement (i.e. overall motion <3 mm across the runs and <2 mm of motion between adjacent functional volumes) were included. 


### Overall choices and RTs with different share and stake sizes 
  
Forty-three participants (25 females and 18 males; mean age = 23.67 ± 3.00 years) were included in this behavioural data analysis. 

We analysed the UG binary choices using repeated-measures logistic regression implemented with the generalized estimating equations method. We modelled the within-subject effects of share size, stake size and their interaction for the fair offers. We also analysed RTs using repeated-measures ANOVA with share size and stake size as within-subject factors (see Supplementary Information for the RT results). IBM SPSS 20.0 was used for the statistical analysis (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) with the α value set at 0.05. In situations in which sphericity was violated, we employed the Greenhouse-Geisser correction. Bonferroni’s correction was used for post-hoc multiple comparisons. All behavioural data were analysed with the same criteria. 

Crucially, as found robustly in the classical UG that the majority of proposers offered fairly (e.g., ref.  ), we examined the choices of a fair offer over a selfish offer with different share sizes and different stake sizes to understand the proposing behaviour in our modified UG in the first subset of data analyses. In addition to the behaviour of offering fairly, we were also interested in the behaviour of offering selfishly. Consistent with the literature , the possibility of making a very selfish offer was very low and that made for very few corresponding images and unreliable imaging results (see Supplementary Information Table   for details). Therefore, we selected only the cases in which proposers had to choose between a fair offer and a slightly selfish offer (i.e. offering 40% or 30% of the stake) in different stake sizes for a second subset of data analyses.

Of the 43 participants, five (participants 24, 43, 45, 49 and 59) were not included because they did not have data for certain conditions, resulting in 38 participants included in the RT analysis of fair offers. 

We compared the RTs of choosing a fair offer over a selfish offer with four different share sizes and two stakes in a two-way (4 share sizes × 2 stake sizes) repeated-measures ANOVA with share size and stake size as within-subject factors. Furthermore, we tested the trend model that best explained the RTs for choosing a fair offer contingent on share size of the paired selfish offer using polynomial contrasts. 

Five participants (participants 38, 39, 55, 57 and 60) were excluded from the imaging analyses, given extensive head motion, and another six participants (participants 24, 43, 45, 46, 49 and 59) were excluded because they did not have sufficient trials per condition (n < 5) to gain adequate statistical power (see Supplementary Information Table   for details). Consequently, 32 participants (19 females and 13 males; mean age = 23.97 ± 3.12 years) were included. The 32 participants showed the same tendency in their behavioural data (both the proportion and RT of fair offers) as the 43 participants. 

Imaging analysis was performed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) software package. The functional images of each participant were corrected for slice timing and head motion and then co-registered to the participant’s segmented grey matter image. Next, the images were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space and spatially smoothed by convolution using an 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. For simplicity and to ensure sufficient statistical power for the imaging analysis, we merged the options that offered 40% and 30% of the stake as ‘slightly selfish offers’, and options that offered 20% and 10% of the stake as ‘very selfish offers’. Consequently, we obtained up to nine different response conditions from the participant’s choice (a fair or a selfish offer) in the four experimental conditions (2 merged share sizes × 2 stake sizes) plus one error response condition in which participants did not make a choice within 4 s. We modelled the data on each participant with up to nine regressors using the general linear model as the first-level analysis. Next, we specified the onset and duration (0 s) of each response trial and entered the corresponding RT as the parametric modulator with first-order modulation to avoid RT variability correlated with the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal . The six parameters of the realignment were also included in the model as regressors of no interest. The parameter estimates for choosing a fair offer by each participant were fed into a two-way (2 merged share sizes × 2 stake sizes) flexible factorial design with merged share size and stake size as within-subject factors using a random-effects analysis for the second level. The t-contrasts of interest were the differences in merged share sizes and stake sizes and the interaction effects. The threshold of the statistical maps was at a voxel-wise intensity of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected) with a false discovery rate correction at the cluster level using the whole brain as the volume of interest. The resulting regions of activation were characterized in terms of their peak voxels in the MNI coordinate space. 


### Choosing between a fair and a slightly selfish offer with different stake sizes 
  
Of the 43 participants, nine (participants 17, 23, 25, 27, 35, 38, 39, 55 and 60) always chose fair offers and six participants (participants 20, 28, 29, 45, 49 and 59) did not have data under certain conditions (see Supplementary Information Table   for details). Therefore, 28 participants (18 females and 10 males; mean age = 23.79 ± 3.10 years) were included in this behavioural analysis. 

The rates of choosing a fair offer in the different stake sizes were compared using a paired   t  -test. The RT between choices of a fair and a slightly selfish offer in different stake sizes was compared using a two-way (2 choices × 2 stake sizes) repeated-measures ANOVA with choice and stake size as within-subject factors. 

Of the 28 participants, one (participant 57) had extensive head motion and eight (participants 24, 30, 31, 33, 40, 43, 46 and 56) did not have sufficient images per condition (n < 5) (see Supplementary Information Table   for details). In the end, 19 participants (12 females and 7 males; mean age = 24.84 ± 3.22 years) were included in the imaging analysis. The 19 participants showed a similar pattern in their behaviours as the 28 participants included in the behavioural analysis. 

The parametric estimates for each participant (i.e. choices of a fair offer and a slightly selfish offer in low and high stakes) obtained in the first-level analysis were entered into a two-way (2 choices × 2 stake sizes) flexible factorial design with choice and stake size as within-subject factors in a random-effects group-level analysis for the imaging analysis. The t-contrasts of interest were the differences in choices and stake sizes and the interaction effects. The significance levels for behavioural and imaging analyses were identical to those in the first subset of data analyses.

# Abstract
 
In this study, we used resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to explore altered putamen functional connectivity (FC) in Parkinson's disease patients with anxiety disorder. We divided 65 Parkinson's disease patients into anxiety (PD-A;   n  =18) and non-anxiety (PD-NA;   n  =45) groups based on a Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale cutoff score of 12. The PD-A patients exhibited altered putamen FC with cortical and subcortical regions. The PD-A patients showed enhanced putamen FC with the caudatum, which correlated with increased emotional processing during anxiety. Decreased putamen FC with the orbitofrontal gyrus and cerebellum also correlated with increased anxiety in Parkinson's disease. Our findings demonstrate that anxiety disorder in Parkinson's disease is associated with abnormal putamen FC networks, especially with caudatum, orbitofrontal gyrus and cerebellum.

## INTRODUCTION 
  
Anxiety syndrome is more prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (6%-55%) [ ] than in the general population and non-PD patients [ ,  ]. Furthermore, anxiety in PD is associated with increased motor symptoms and negatively impacts quality of life [ ]. Anxiety is clinically under-diagnosed in PD patients and is neglected while researching PD pathology. 

In recent years, neuroimaging technology has been widely used to investigate functional and structural alterations of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD brains [ ,  ]. Positron emission computed tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used to image individual brain regions while investigating anxiety disorders in PD [ ]. Most PET/SPECT reports show correlation between putamen and severity of anxiety [ – ]. However, the association between anxiety in PD and alterations in putamen FCfunctional connectivity (FC) with other brain regions is unknown. 

Resting state-functional MRI (rs-fMRI) measures the resting blood oxygen level-dependent signal to determine spontaneous brain activity between functionally linked brain regions at the level of neural networks. FC indicates inter-regional temporal patterns of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal [ ]. Recently, rs-fMRI has been extensively used to explore neurological and psychiatric diseases [ ,  ], including various motor [ ]and non-motor symptoms [ – ] in PD. 

The aim of this study was to use rs-fMRI to analyze differences in the putamen FC patterns among 3 study subject groups:, namely, PD patients with anxiety (PD-A), PD patients without anxiety (PD-NA) and healthy controls. 


## MATERIALS AND METHODS 
  
### Study subjects 
  
Sixty-five right-handed PD patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic of our hospital and diagnosed with idiopathic PD according to the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria [ ]. The following patients were excluded from the study: (1) patients with corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, vascular parkinsonism, and other forms of parkinsonism; (2) patients with contraindications to MRI such as claustrophobia, metallic implants or devices in the body; (3) patients with severe cognitive decline indicated by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score < 24; (4) patients with clinically prominent depressive symptoms (17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, HAMD score > 14) for controlling possible hybrid factors. None of the patients took anti-psychotic drugs. MRI scans and clinical examinations were performed at least 12 h after withdrawal from medications to mitigate the pharmacological effects on neural activity. Meanwhile, 24 healthy controls without psychological and neurological disturbances or neuroimaging abnormalities were recruited for this study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the ethics committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. 


### Clinical assessment of study subjects 
  
PD patients were classified into PD-A (  n   = 18) and PD-NA (  n   = 45) groups based on the cut off score of 12 on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) score [ – ]. The HAMA scale is a fourteen-item scale (total scores ranging 0-56) that measures both psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms [ ], which is useful in evaluating anxiety severity in clinical practice and research [ ]. Anxiety disorders of PD patients were assessed by a trained movement disorder specialist (Kezhong Zhang), sensitized to psychiatric disorders in PD. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) and Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) staging scales were used to assess PD motor severity and disease stage, respectively. Total levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD), LEDD of levodopa preparations and LEDD of dopamine receptor agonists of each PD patient were calculated as previously described [ ]. Disease duration of PD patients and education levels of all subjects were recorded. Cognitive function, executive function and symptoms of depression were also quantified separately by MMSE, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and HAMD. 


### Rs-fMRI methodology 
  
MRI scanning were performed with a 3.0 T Siemens MAGNETOM Verio whole-body MRI system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany) equipped with eight-channel, phase-array head coils. Tight foam padding was used to minimize head movement and ear-plugs were used to reduce noise. Subjects were instructed to remain motionless, close their eyes, remain awake, and not to think about anything in particular. T1-weighted 3D high resolution anatomical images were acquired using the following volumetric 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence: repetition time (TR) = 1900 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.95 ms, flip angle (FA) = 9°, slice thickness = 1 mm, slices = 160, field of view (FOV) = 230 × 230 mm , matrix size = 256 × 256 and voxel size = 1 × 1× 1 mm . Resting-state functional images were collected using the following echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 21 ms, FA = 90°, FOV = 256 × 256 mm , in-plane matrix = 64 × 64, slices = 35, slice thickness = 3 mm, no slice gap, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm , total 4 volumes = 240. 


### Rs-fMRI data analysis 
  
The rs-fMRI data was analyzed by the data processing assistant for resting-state fMRI (DPARSF,  ) [ ] with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8,  ). The analysis included 1) removal of the first 10 time points; 2) slice timing correction; 3) head motion correction   via   six-parameter rigid body spatial transformation during data acquisition; 4) nonlinear registration of the high-resolution T1 structural images to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template and segmenting them into white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid using the DARTEL (diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra) algorithm [ ] followed by further structural analyses of the resulting segments; 5) nuisance signal removal (white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, global signal, 6-head motion parameters as covariates)   via   multiple regression; 6) spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute template; 7) resampling images into a spatial resolution of 3×3×3 mm ; 8) spatial smoothening with a Gaussian kernel (full width at half-maximum = 4×4×4 mm ); 9) temporal bandpass filtering (0.01 < f < 0.08 Hz) and linear detrended removal. We excluded subjects from further analysis if the translation or rotation of head movement was > 2 mm or 2° in any direction. Additionally, the mean head translation, mean head rotation, and frame-wise displacement were calculated [ ]. There were no differences in head motion parameters among the three groups (  p   > 0.05). 


### Functional connectivity analysis 
  
The left and right putamen were defined as two regions of interest (ROI) based on the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) template by selecting specific areas to study anxiety-dependent resting-state functional networks in PD patients. A voxel-wise FC analysis was performed by computing the temporal correlation between the mean time series of each ROI and the time series of each voxel within the brain. Pearson's correlation coefficient maps were created for each individual subject and were converted to a z-value using Fisher's z transformation. 

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to identify brain areas with differences between the three study subject groups with age, gender, education, HAMD scores and gray matter volume as covariates (voxel-level   p   < 0.05; cluster size > 113 voxels; corrected   p   < 0.01 as determined by AlphaSim correction). These areas were then extracted as a mask. Then, two-sample post hoc t tests were performed within this mask, with age, gender, education, HAMD scores and gray matter volume as covariates, to detect differences between study subject groups (voxel-level   p   < 0.05; cluster size of the left putamen > 13 voxels; cluster size of the right putamen > 16 voxels; corrected   p   < 0.01 as determined by AlphaSim correction). Additionally, for each ROI, the clusters that showed differences in FC between PD-A and PD-NA groups were extracted separately. Then the average FC value of each cluster was calculated to estimate the correlation of anxiety severity. The Pearson correlation between mean FC values and HAMA scores was calculated by IBM SPSS statistics v20.0.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and the significance was set at   p   < 0.01 (two-tailed;  ). 


### Statistical analysis 
  
The clinical data was analyzed with the IBM SPSS statistics v20.0.0 software and expressed as mean ± s.d. The continuous and categorical variables were analyzed by either one-way analysis of variance test, chi-square test, independent-sample   t  -test or nonparametric tests.   p   < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 



## RESULTS 
  
### Demographic and clinical characteristics 
  
The demographic and clinical characteristics of PD-A, PD-NA and healthy control subjects are summarized in Table  . The three subject groups showed differences in age, gender, HAMD scores, but education levels were similar. The PD-A and PD-NA subjects had similar disease duration, H&Y staging, total LEDD, LEDD of levodopa preparations and LEDD of dopamine receptor agonists and UPDRSIII scores (  p   > 0.01). The MMSE and FAB scores for PD-A and PD-NA subjects was also similar. As expected, the HAMA scores were different between the three groups (  p   < 0.01).

### Functional connectivity data 
  
There were differences in the left putamen FC with right orbitofrontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right postcentral cortex and left anterior cingulate among all three study groups, namely, PD-A, PD-NA and healthy controls. Similarly, all three study groups showed differences in right putamen FC with the left orbitofrontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, bilateral paracentral lobule, right precuneus, left temporal pole, left middle occipital gyrus, right cerebellum, right insula, bilateral middle cingulate gyrus and left caudatum. 

Next, two-sample post hoc   t  -tests were performed to detect pair-wise differences in FC of the putamen regions among the PD-A, PD-NA and healthy control groups. The PD-A group showed following differences with PD-NA group: (1) reduced left putamen FC with right orbitofrontal gyrus; (2) reduced right putamen FC with left orbitofrontal gyrus, right cerebellum and right precuneus; (3) increased right putamen FC with right insula, left temporal pole, left middle occipital gyrus, left caudatum and right middle cingulate gyrus (Table   and Figure  ).

The PD-NA subjects showed the following differences with the healthy control subjects: (1) decreased left putamen FC with left anterior cingulated gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus and right postcentral cortex; (2) increased left putamen FC with right orbitofrontal gyrus; (3) reduced right putamen FC with right cerebellum, left middle frontal gyrus and left middle cingulated gyrus; and (4) increased right putamen FC with left orbitofrontal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus and right paracentral lobule (Table   and Figure  ).

## DISCUSSION 
  
In the present study, we compared the FC alterations in the putamen region of the brain in Parkinson's patients with anxiety disorder to Parkinson's patients without anxiety and healthy controls. Rs-fMRI analysis revealed significant alterations in FC in the PD-A patients compared to the PD-NA and HC groups. The PD-A patients showed decreased left putamen FC with right orbitofrontal gyrus and right putamen FC with left orbitofrontal gyrus, right cerebellum and right precuneus. On the other hand, there was increased right putamen FC with right insula, left temporal pole, left middle occipital gyrus, left caudatum and right middle cingulate gyrus compared to PD patients without anxiety. This suggested abnormal putamen FC in the cortical and subcortical regions in PD-A patients. 

The HAMA scores showed positive correlation between right putamen FC and left caudatum, but negative correlation for left putamen FC with right orbitofrontal gyrus and right putamen FC with left orbitofrontal gyrus and right cerebellum. These results demonstrate that anxiety in PD patients correlates with the aberrant putamen FC in them, especially with the caudatum, orbitofrontal gyrus and cerebellum. 

Neuroimaging studies with  I-FP-CIT SPECT, SPECT with TRODAT-1 or PET have explored anxiety severity in PD patients by assessing dopamine transporter (DAT) availability or density [ – ,  ,  ]. Most studies observed an inverse correlation between DAT availability in the putamen with the severity of anxiety in PD [ ,  ,  ]. However, Ceravolo   et al  . showed that increased striatal DAT density was associated with mild anxiety symptoms in PD patients [ ]. The PD rat model depleted of striatal dopamine showed increased anxiety [ ,  ], which improved upon L-DOPA treatment [ ,  ]. Furthermore, social anxiety disorder, which is common in PD patients was associated with dopaminergic-mediated striatal circuits [ ] and sustained suppression of DA receptor activity [ ]. These findings suggest a relationship between anxiety and dopaminergic dysfunction in PD patients. Therefore, we focused on interactions of the bilateral putamen with other brain areas in the present study. 

Our results show increased putamen FC with caudate in PD-A relative to PD-NA patients. Although striatal dysfunction is typically related to motor impairment in PD [ ], it is implicated in emotional processing [ ], thereby suggesting a common pathophysiological mechanism. Neuroimaging by [ F] fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) showed that anxiety symptoms in PD were inversely associated with DAT availability in the caudatum or decreased caudate metabolism [ ]. Therefore, enhanced putamen FC and caudatum suggested emotional processing during anxiety in PD patients. 

We also observed reduced bilateral putamen FC with orbitofrontal gyrus in PD-A compared to PD-NA patients. Previous studies in non-PD patients demonstrated that orbitofrontal gyrus as the site for emotion processing. Milad   et al.   showed the role of medial orbitofrontal gyrus in conditioned fear response based on various animal studies and human neuroimaging analysis [ ]. Patients with agoraphobia, which is a panic disorder showed decreased gray matter volume in their left medial orbitofrontal gyrus compared to healthy controls [ ]. Moreover, patients with impaired orbitofrontal gyrus showed mental disturbances such as impulsive, socially inappropriate behavior and emotional changes compared to control subjects [ ]. This suggested the role of impaired orbitofrontal gyrus in anxiety disorders. Additionally, a T1-weighted MRI study in patients with early PD showed that focal orbitofrontal gyrus atrophy led to anxiety disorder [ ]. Topographically, orbitofrontal gyrus projects into regions of the striatum [ ] and the frontostriatal pathway has been implicated in anxiety [ ]. Based on these considerations, attenuated connections between orbitofrontal gyrus and putamen suggest abnormal frontostriatal pathway, which contributes to anxiety disorder in PD. 

There was also reduced FC between cerebellum and putamen in PD-A relative to PD-NA subjects, thereby negatively correlating with anxiety severity. Clinical, experimental and neuroimaging studies indicate that the cerebellum is involved in neural processes beyond the motor domain [ ,  ]. For example, electrical stimulation of the human cerebellum produces anxiety and fear [ ]. The synaptic connections between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells of cerebellum are involved in the learned fear and their long-term potentiation contributes to fear memory [ ]. In functional brain imaging studies with PET, increased blood flow was observed in the left cerebellar hemisphere during fear conditioning [ ]. Therefore, both human and animal studies have shown that cerebellum contributes to fear-associated learning. Recently, a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on functional topography in the human cerebellum showed involvement of the cerebellar posterior lobe in cognitive/emotional function [ ]. This is in agreement with our findings of decreased cerebellum FC, especially in the posterior lobe. Consequently, decreased communication between cerebellum and putamen plays a role in anxiety disorders observed in PD patients. 

This study has several limitations. Firstly, our sample size was relatively small and therefore may not have detected exact neural substrates of PD-related anxiety disorder. Secondly, anxiety and depression overlap in PD patients with similar symptoms and pathophysiology [ ,  ]. Hence, patients with clinically distinct depressive symptoms were excluded from our study. However, HAMD scores still showed significant differences between study subject groups and therefore, FC was analyzed. Besides, age and gender were significantly different among groups. Many studies have shown correlation between PD-related anxiety disorder with age and gender [ ,  ]. Therefore, these were analyzed as covariates. Finally, although the present study defined important regions of interest that are responsible for anxiety in PD, it did not represent complete FC analysis. Therefore, further comprehensive studies are needed to identify other anxiety related networks that were not analyzed by our study. 

In conclusion, our study showed that anxiety in PD was associated with altered FC network between putamen and other regions of the brain, especially caudatum, orbitofrontal gyrus and cerebellum.

# Title

Functional resonance magnetic imaging (fMRI) in adolescents with idiopathic musculoskeletal pain: a paradigm of experimental pain

# Keywords

Musculoskeletal pain
Magnetic resonance imaging
Pain
Functional neuroimaging
Adolescents
Juvenile fibromyalgia


# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
Studies on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that adults with musculoskeletal pain syndromes tolerate smaller amount of pressure (pain) as well as differences in brain activation patterns in areas related to pain.The objective of this study was to evaluate, through fMRI, the brain activation in adolescents with idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (IMP) while performing an experimental paradigm of pain. 


## Methods 
  
The study included 10 consecutive adolescents with idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (average age 16.3±1.0) and 10 healthy adolescents age-matched. fMRI exams were performed in a 3 T scanner (Magnetom Trio, Siemens) using an event-related design paradigm. Pressure stimuli were performed in the nondominant hand thumb, divided into two stages, fixed pain and variable pain. 

The two local Research Ethics Committees (Ethics Committee from Universidade Federal de São Paulo- Brazil, process number 0688/11, on July 1st, 2011 and Ethics Committee from Hospital Israelita Albert Einsten – Brazil, process number 1673, on October 19th, 2011) approved the study. 


## Results 
  
The idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (IMP) group showed a reduced threshold for pain (3.7 kg/cm  versus 4.45 kg/cm ,   p   = 0.005). Control group presented increased bain activation when compared to IMP group in the following areas: thalamus (  p   = 0.00001), precentral gyrus (  p   = 0.0004) and middle frontal gyrus (  p   = 0.03). In intragroup analysis, IMP group showed greater brain activation during the unpredictable stimuli of the variable pain stage, especially in the lingual gyrus (  p   = 0.0001), frontal lobe (  p   = 0.0001), temporal gyrus (  p   = 0.0001) and precentral gyrus (  p   = 0.03), when compared to predictable stimulus of fixed pain. The same intragroup analysis with the control group showed greater activation during the unpredictable stimuli in regions of the precentral gyrus (  p   = 0.0001), subcallosal area (  p   = 0.0001), right and left occipital fusiform gyrus (  p   = 0.0001; (  p   = 0.0007), middle gyrus (  p   = 0.01) and precuneus   p   = (0.02). 


## Conclusion 
  
Adolescents with idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (IMP) tend to request higher brain function in cognitive-emotional areas when interpreting unpredictable sensory-perceptual situations. Therefore, it is assumed that this difference in pain processing in adolescents with IMP make the subjective experience of pain something more intense and unpleasant.

## Background 
  
According to criterias established by Malleson in 1992 [ ], Idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (IMP) is defined by the occurrence of intermittent and generalized musculoskeletal pain in three or more spots for at least 3 months, excluding other diseases, for example rheumatic, neoplastic and infectious diseases, which may justify the pain complaint [ ]. It affects around 12% to 35% of children and adolescents in school age [ – ]. Common in girls, the symptoms usually starts around 12–13 years and has its incidence peak at around 14 years [ ,  ], with significant impact and damage in social, school and family of patients [ ,  ,  ]. It is known that constitutional and environmental factors play an important role in triggering the IMP. There are a few hypotheses about the intrinsic factors related to IMP, which includes aspects of nociception and factors related to the pain threshold, in this case a differentiation in the the pain-related activation areas in the brain [ – ]. 

Since 1968, the basic understanding about pain comes from the theory proposed by Melzack and Casey [ ], where the pain processing occurs through sensory and emotional components processed in parallel by different brain structures. Therefore, sensory-discriminative aspects, such as type, location and intensity, are processed by areas such as lateral thalamus, somatosensory cortex 1 and 2 (S1 and S2) and posterior parietal cortex, while affective-motivational aspects are processed by areas such as thalamus lateral, prefrontal cortex and limbic system [ – ]. After some additional studies, cingulate became part of this network [ ]. 

In an attempt to expand the research about the brain mechanisms of pain processing in recent years, studies have been conducted with the aid of refined neuroimaging techniques and paradigms of experimental pain in patients with musculoskeletal pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia and complex regional pain [ ,  ,  – ]. These studies, performed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), demonstrated that adult patients with fibromyalgia (FM), a subclassification of IMP syndromes, tolerate a smaller amount of pressure (pain) and showed differences in brain activation patterns in cortical and subcortical areas related to pain, especially in the cortex of the cingulate, insula, S1 and S2, as well as brain volume changes, when compared to healthy controls, i.e. without complaints of chronic pain [ ,  ,  ]. Studies with fMRI in adults that evaluated the aging effect on the brain showed changes in the pattern of gray and white matter in accordance with the age of patients with fibromyalgia, as well as a strong correlation between smaller amount of gray and white matter with greater sensitivity to pain [ ]. Lebel et al. suggest that changes resulting from chronic pain occurring at a time of intense development and neuroplasticity may modify the pain processing mode in adolescents with complex regional syndrome [ ]. However, there is no data on when these changes get started and few studies involving children and adolescents with IMP. 

The main objective of this pioneer study was to evaluate, using fMRI techniques, the brain activation in adolescents with IMP during an experimental paradigm of pain. As hypothesis, different patterns of brain activation are expected in areas related to pain matrix (primary and secondary somatosensory, insular, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortices and thalamus) [ – ].

The two local Research Ethics Committees (Ethics Committee from Universidade Federal de São Paulo- Brazil, process number 0688/11, on July 1st, 2011 and Ethics Committee from Hospital Israelita Albert Einsten – Brazil, process number 1673, on October 19th, 2011) approved the study. All participants and their guardians were informed about the procedures, risks and conducts. The fMRI was performed after the signature of the consent form. All participants and their guardians agreed to the study and future publications of the results. 


### Participants 
  
From a population of 74 IMP patients (aged between 5 and 18 years old) followed in our pediatric musculoskeletal pain clinic, 12 adolescents were consecutively selected according to the criteria of Malleson et al. 1992 [ ]. All patients were under medical treatment by a pediatric rheumatologist for at least 6 months. There were excluded patients with following clinical aspects: history of psychiatric and/or neurological disorders diagnosticated by neurologist or history of, traumatic brain injury; use of drug or psychoactive drugs; incidental findings and changes in neural structural images, such as tumors and cysts; patients with fMRI contraindications conditions, such as use of metal clips, implants, braces or unremovable piercings. 

The fMRI exam was then applied to 12 adolescents with IMP, aged between 14 and 17 years, of both genders and 11 matched controls, without history of pain, tanner stage 5 [ ], selected in the same social groups (school and neighborhood) through indications made by adolescents with IMPTwo subjects from IMP group were excluded, one due to use of braces and another due diagnosis of Turner syndrome. 

Both participants of the IMP group, during the recruitment telephone contact did not report the existence of conditions incompatible with the selection criteria (hidden dental braces and the diagnosis of Turner syndrome). These conditions were only observed when the adolescents were already in the research institute and, finally, and 1 adolescent from the control group due to incidental finding of a cyst. The final sample consisted of 20 adolescents, 10 allocated in IMP group (9 girls and 1 boy, average age 16.3 ± 1.1) and 10 healthy adolescents in the control group (9 girls and 1 boy, mean age 16.1 ± 1.4) with no complaint of pain. 

It is worth mentioning that all adolescents of the IMP group also had positive diagnosis for juvenile fibromyalgia, according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria [ ,  ]. 

None of the adolescents were under continuous use of pain medication, yet they were all advised not to use any pain medications (including prescription-free) during the last 24 h before the test. 


### Procedures 
  
#### Sample characterization 
  
The sample was characterized as the following questionnaires: A)   Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory - Version 4.0 (PedsQL 4.0) Brazilian adaptation for free use   [ ] - measurement of children’s quality of life and healthy adolescents and patients with chronic diseases, parents and tens Version; B)   Stress Scale in Adolescents – ESA   [ ] - evaluation of symptoms related to stress reactions; C)   Beck Depression Inventory - BDI-II   [ ] - evaluation of symptoms corresponding to DSM-IV criteria for diagnosing depressive disorders; D)   Visual analogue scale – VAS   [ ] - quantification of pain intensity. 


#### Pain paradigm 
  
Discrete pressure stimuli, lasting 2 s, were applied to the nondominant thumb by means of hard rubber tube connected to a hydraulic piston, which were connected by a combination of a second piston valve. This second piston transmitted the pressure of standardized weights laid out on a platform for controlled and reproducible pressure stimuli. The experimental pain equipment is designed exclusively for the study of fMRI [ ]. 

It was used a paradigm of event-related design, divided into two steps: 1)   Fixed Pain  , in which for 6 min participant received 22 pressure stimuli of pain subjective to score 6 (six) with interval of 16 s, preceded by display of a cross symbol on the screen, as shown in Fig.  ; 2)   Variable pain  , in which for 12 min participant received 45 randomly distributed pressure stimuli were applied every 16 s, however with 2 different intensity possibilities (0.5 kg/cm  or equivalent pressure to score 6) in 3 conditions: A)   predictable pain stimuli  , when the participant visualize a square (■) on the screen and then received the pressure stimulus with intensity equivalent to score 6 of pain; B)   unpredictable pain stimuli  , when participants visualized a diamond (◆), then, could receive either a pressure stimulus score 0 (zero) or score 6 (six) in order to not be able to predict what stimulus would be administered. C)   neutral stimuli  , a triangle (Δ) was presented on the screen and then received the pressure stimulation with intensity of 0.5 kg/cm , corresponding to score 0 (zero) pain, as shown in Fig.  .   
Experimental design of the fixed pain 
    
Experimental design of the variable pain 
  

The same protocol was applied to all participants, with all steps described above. They were not previously informed about the meaning of each symbol visualized prior to the stimuli (ie, which symbol would be followed by pain, non-pain, and unpredictable stimuli). 


#### Calibration of pressure stimuli 
  
The intensity of the stimuli was previously calibrated for each participant. Each participant was asked to verbally graduate the intensity of the pain felt for each stimulus by a numeral analog scale of 0 to 10. The session consisted of an ascending series of pressure stimuli, starting with 0.5 kg/cm  and increasing 0.5 kg/cm  to the limit of tolerance or up to 9.0 kg/cm . 

The stimuli were applied twice in ascending order and, within a short break, applied a third time in descending order to confirm the degree of pressure. For each participant, the pain threshold was defined as the greatest stimulus, whose intensity received at least two equal scores, being assigned to it, score 6 (six) of pain on a scale of 0 to 10. Our study followed the same parameters and methodology adopted by international studies [ ,  ,  – ,  ]. 


#### fMRI instrumentation 
  
All tests were performed in a 3.0 T Magnetom Trio equipment: TIM System (Siemens Medical - Germany) with 40 mT/m gradients, increase ratio of 230 mT/m/s and dedicated receptive coil of 12 elements. 

Functional images were acquired by sequence of T2 echo planar image (EPI-BOLD) for the whole brain, capturing the signal contrast variations according to the   Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent   (BOLD) effect with the following conditions: - GRE EPI T2 - BOLD: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, thickness of 5 mm, 0.5 mm range, FOV 200 mm and matrix of 64 × 64, with 405 volumes, neglecting the first 4 TR’s, for the decrement signal. 

BOLD contrast is the MR imaging method most often used to produce information related to brain function. 

This method is based on MR images made sensitive to changes in the state of oxygenation of the hemoglobin [ ]. This molecule has diVerent magnetic properties depending on the concentration of O2; when it is fully saturated with oxygen (oxyhemoglobin) it behaves as a diamagnetic substance, while when some oxygen atoms have been removed (deoxyhemoglobin) it becomes paramagnetic. 

Within any particular imaging voxel (representing a small part of the brain) the proportion of deoxyhemoglobin relativeto oxyhemoglobin dictates how the MR signal will behave in a BOLD image: areas with high concentration of oxyhemoglobin give a higher signal (a brighter image) than areas with low concentration [ ]. 

For stimulus presentation and acquisition of behavioral responses was used the NNL system (NordicNeuroLab Inc., Norway) via dedicated algorithm (E-prime -   Psychology Software Tools, Inc., USA  ). This system uses independent binocular projection via LCD screen and hand response detection through keyboard compatible with magnetic environment. 



### Data analysis 
  
All behavioral data were exposed as   average ± standard deviation  . The variables were compared between groups using the Student-t test for independent samples in the Statistica Software (Statsoft). The significance level of   p   < 0.05 was adopted. 

The obtained functional images were processed and analyzed by the statistical program FSL version 4.1 (FMRIB Software Library - Analysis Group, Oxford, UK -  ), specifically the FEAT module (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) version 5.98 (to detect brain activation based on changes in the BOLD signal). 

The data were processed in three steps: pre-processing, statistical analysis and presentation of the activation images. Individual activation maps were obtained using the general linear model (GLM). 

The images obtained from the statistical analysis with Student-t test indicated the regions where the signal varied significantly when comparing to the periods of activation and rest. It was calculated, for each pixel, the activation coefficient and the corresponding z-score. Analyzing the BOLD signal corresponding to the fMRI signal difference between the activation states and rest, the z-score is calculated taking into account the average value (μ) and standard deviation (σ). 

A minimum statistical threshold of 1.9 (  p   < 0.05) was used to determine which voxels have been activated during the pain paradigm execution. The anatomical regions were identified by overlapping those on structural images. The maps of the atlas system MNI 152 (Montreal Neurological Institute) and Harvard-Oxford, available in FSLview software, were used for the classification of the active areas.

The PedsQL 4.0 scores related to health showed differences between the groups, from both the points of view, adolescents (  p   = 0.007) and their parents/guardians (  p   = 0.003), where the group of adolescents with IMP showed lower scores. The IMP patients also reported complaints of spontaneous pain, with an average score of 3/10 (VAS) in the pre-exam time. 

From a clinical point of view, based on the results obtained on the scales, it is possible to say that our sample showed no differences in the occurrence of stress-related symptoms (SSA: 2.2 ± 0.8;   p   = 0.08), nor indicative symptoms of depression (BDI-II: 10 ± 10.4;   p   = 0.15). Means and standard deviations of the sample characterization are shown in Table  . 

### Intergroup analysis 
  
#### Weight used 
  
The adolescents of the IMP group demonstrated a significantly reduced pain threshold when compared to healthy adolescent group (3.7 kg/cm  versus 4.45 kg/cm ,   p   = 0.005). By the end of the experiment, the average pain score reported by the participants for this pressure stimuli in the fMRI paradigm was 7.7 ± 1.7, on a scale of 0 to 10, varying from the initial score of 6. 


#### Fixed pain 
  
The comparison between the two groups during execution of fixed pain paradigm, i.e. maximum calibrated pressure to each individual, equivalent to subjective pain equal to 6 (IMP group, 3.7 kg/cm  ± 0.483 kg/cm ; Controls, 4.45 kg/cm  ± 0.685 kg/cm ), showed increased brain activation in the control group, as shown in Fig.  , when compared to the IMP group in 3 clusters: the thalamus, precentral gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. Table   describes the main anatomical sections of greater activation according to the MNI coordinates. It is important to emphasize that the IMP group activation maps did not show increased activation during the fixed pain paradigm.

The comparison between the fixed pain paradigm versus the moments of unexpected pain of variable pain paradigm, considering in the latter only the moments in which the pressure of score 6 was applied, showed in IMP group four greater activation cluster during the unpredictable pain, all of which are in the right hemisphere: lingual gyrus, prefrontal cortex, inferior temporal gyrus and precentral gyrus, shown in Fig.   and described in Table  . In this table are also described the main areas and location of the activated voxels within these four clusters, while presenting the pressure stimuli.

## Discussion 
  
We observed differences in the brain activation pattern during pain, when comparing adolescents from IMP and healthy groups. The brain activation results pointed to areas mainly related to the pain affective-motivational domain. To our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study about the brain function using an experimental paradigm of pain in a group of adolescents with IMP. 

In addition to imaging studies, other relevant issues on IMP were evaluated, such as quality of life and the occurrence of indicative symptoms of stress and depression. 

Since our sample included a population in age from full development and brain plasticity, we took care to pair the factors with possible influences on brain development, such as age and educational level. 

In our clinical practice, IMP adolescents and their families come to clinic visits with many complaints about social and emotional difficulties in their day-to-day. The poor PedsQL 4.0 scores showed the perception of adolescents with IMP. As expected, we observed worst scores in physical, educational, emotional and social dimensions of patients. 

Also, behavioral data indicates similarities in relation to emotional aspects in both groups. The occurrence of stress and depression disorders in both groups was not identified. 

Depression is highlighted as one of the most common symptoms in adult patients with IMP, especially in fibromyalgia [ ,  ], still being related to differences in brain processing of pain in these patients [ ,  ,  ,  ]. 

Unlike the findings in adults, but corroborating previous studies [ ] for the pediatric population, our negative results for symptoms of stress or depression suggest that, despite a number of complaints and functional impairment, adolescents with IMP do not seem to yet experience significant mood changes found in adults with chronic pain. 

The search for factors related to pain pathogenesis is in a fruitful field, because little is known about the subject. Recent studies show that the uses of matched experimental paradigms to sophisticated neuroimaging techniques allow a better understanding of brain mechanisms of pain processing. Pain is a complex and subjective experience recruiting the operation of multiple and different brain areas, including the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus and insula [ ]. 

However, cerebral pain processing is not limited only to these locations, since simple stimulus like sting of a needle or pressure on the skin can lead to activation of a larger number of brain areas located in cortical and subcortical areas. Studies on the assessment of brain response through paradigms of experimental pain in patients with chronic pain suggests that greater sensitivity to stimuli reported by these patients is accompanied by increased brain responses [ ,  ]. 

The relevance of the research of brain processing during pain also in the pediatric population should be the search for better outcomes and behaviors in order to minimize long-term damage caused by chronic pain. Lebel et al., in the only study with fMRI in pediatric patients with complex regional pain syndrome, suggest that due to chronic pain changes in the central nervous system that occur in this stage of development and neuroplasticity may alter the pain processing on these individuals during their lifes [ ]. 

During calibration of pressure stimuli, adolescents with IMP had a lower pain threshold than their healthy peers, similar to what happens in adults with pain idiopathic syndromes [ ,  ]. 

In the fixed pain paradigm used in our study, all presented pressure stimuli had the same intensity, at constant intervals. In this paradigm, the control group showed greater brain activation compared to the group with IMP, and these activations were in areas related to sensory perception, motor perception and pain perception, such as thalamus, S1 and S2. Unlike most studies with adults [ ,  ,  ,  ], our results suggest a greater activation of areas only in healthy adolescents, i.e. areas related to sensory-discriminative aspects of pain. However, we must highlight the fact that all adolescents IMP group reported some kind of spontaneous pain, with grades ranging from 2 to 4 in the VAS scale (0–10), since even before the administration of pressure tests, a fact absolutely opposite to the control group. This is not mentioned in studies with adults [ ,  ,  ,  ]. 

This finding is relevant, especially when we analyze the results of the next stage, when the unpredictability factor was added to variable pain paradigm. When exposed to unpredictable pain stimuli, both groups showed greater brain activation when compared to fixed paradigm pain stimuli. 

In IMP group, the main differences occurred in areas related to processing information related to emotional aspects, such as self-awareness and emotional regulation (precuneos, cingulate gyrus, subcallosal area) and also in areas involved in the interpretation of sensory stimuli, as images and somesthesic information and motor (temporal gyrus, pre and poscentral gyrus). In contrast, in the control group, the main activation clusters were in areas involved in the interpretation of sensory stimuli, such as image processing, somesthesic information and motor (temporal gyrus, pre and poscentral gyrus, fusiform gyrus and middle temporal gyrus) and you can also identify clusters in areas emotional regulation (precuneos and subcallosal area). 

Thus, in general, both groups showed an increase in the BOLD effect during the unpredictable pressure stimuli compared to fixed pressure stimuli. However, it is possible to notice a difference in the pattern of this increase in activation, especially in IMP group, where the main areas of activation related to the affective-motivational system, for example, the cortex of the cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex. 

It is possible to observe the role of the cingulate gyrus to process unpleasant aspects of pain, such as the integration of these sensations with affection, cognition and selection behavioral response [ ]. Since the role of the prefrontal cortex is associated with better motivational and anticipatory aspects of pain [ ]. Cognitive and affective factors, such as attention, anticipation and anxiety, can also be understood as aspects not related to pain. However, these factors can influence the modulation of pain perception due to the fact of pain processing is also closely related to brain areas related to these aspects [ ]. It is important to consider that our experimental paradigm was not specifically designed to detect involvement of anxiety and anticipation in pain, as participants were previously instructed on the meanings of the symbols that preceded the pressure stimuli, although they could deduce over time. The purpose of this design was to investigate the impact of unpredictability and participation of involuntary attention in pain processing. In the study of Petzke et al. [ ], thermal and pressure, stimuli with different intensities presented randomly caused increased brain activation in both adult controls as in adult patients with fibromyalgia, when compared to stimuli presented in ascending order. 

As already shown in some studies with adults [ ,  ,  ], adolescents in our study demonstrate significantly increased BOLD effect in regions involved in emotional/cognitive aspects related to pain processing, reinforcing the hypothesis that affective/emotional aspects attributed to the frontal-cingulate regions that have a relevant role on pain processing also in adolescents with IMP. 

Perhaps these differences in processing are indicative factors that lead some people to experience more pain.This circuit frontal-cingulate seems to be a key component in the process of understanding how the pain processing occur in adolescents with IMP, since it is involved in functional executive systems as well as pain-related systems. In the lights of our findings, we can assume that these adolescents require more brain effort in cognitive-emotional areas when interpreting unpredictable sensory-perceptual event.. 

In our study, some factors associated with pain within menstruation cycle, time with pain and type of therapeutic treatment (medical, psychological, physiotherapy among others) were not considered in the analysis. The sample size is small, even if we take into account the socioeconomic, educational and emotional aspects have been considered. 


## Conclusion 
  
In front of new or conflicting situations, our results suggests that adolescents IMP tend to request higher brain function in order to interpret them. In addition, these regions, known to be also involved in attentional and executive processes (mainly in the selection of responses and/or conflict resolution) are also required in the processing of pain. Therefore, it is assumed that this difference in pain processing in adolescents with IMP make the subjective experience of pain something more intense and unpleasant. Our results emphasize the importance of early diagnostics and constant therapeutic monitoring as these may prevent the occurrence of mood disorders, common in adults with IMP.

# Title

Musical Imagery Involves Wernicke’s Area in Bilateral and Anti-Correlated Network Interactions in Musicians

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
Musical imagery is the human experience of imagining music without actually hearing it. The neural basis of this mental ability is unclear, especially for musicians capable of engaging in accurate and vivid musical imagery. Here, we created a visualization of an 8-minute symphony as a silent movie and used it as real-time cue for musicians to continuously imagine the music for repeated and synchronized sessions during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The activations and networks evoked by musical imagery were compared with those elicited by the subjects directly listening to the same music. Musical imagery and musical perception resulted in overlapping activations at the anterolateral belt and Wernicke’s area, where the responses were correlated with the auditory features of the music. Whereas Wernicke’s area interacted within the intrinsic auditory network during musical perception, it was involved in much more complex networks during musical imagery, showing positive correlations with the dorsal attention network and the motor-control network and negative correlations with the default-mode network. Our results highlight the important role of Wernicke’s area in forming vivid musical imagery through bilateral and anti-correlated network interactions, challenging the conventional view of segregated and lateralized processing of music versus language.

## Introduction 
  
Mental imagery, including the experiences such as “seeing in the mind’s eye”, or “hearing in the head”, is a hallmark example of human cognitive abilities. It refers to quasi-perceptual mentation that resembles vivid perception in the absence of any external stimuli . Previous studies suggest that imagery and perception tasks involve overlapping cortical areas , which however may not code the same information  or engage in the same network interactions  during both tasks. To date, the neural coding and network bases of mental imagery remains largely unknown and has been a long-standing topic of active research . 

Among various types of mental imagery, musical imagery may occur with surprisingly high accuracy . A famous example illustrating human capabilities in this arena was Ludwig van Beethoven; despite deafness in his later years, he continued composing and conducting great symphonies guided by his “inner ear” . Neurobiologically, functional neuroimaging studies suggest that musical imagery involves cortical areas within and beyond the auditory system , including the auditory belt areas , the association cortex , the prefrontal cortex , and the premotor and supplementary motor areas . Furthermore, it has become well established that such areas do not function in isolation, but interact in networks. In fact, the coordinated network interactions among these areas have been thought to underlie various aspects of musical imagery, e.g. auditory processing , sensorimotor coordination , memory retrieval , cognitive control , and emotion . Hence, musical imagery is a rich behavioral and cognitive context, for which characterizing the patterns and dynamics of cortical networks may help understand the interplay of seemingly segregated functional systems. 

To probe network interactions, it is necessary to gather sufficient samples of neural responses during musical imagery so that the functional relationships among different regions can be reliably measured. To meet this need, a musical-imagery task ought to be complex and sustained for several minutes or longer, especially if brain activity is observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, designing an experiment with musical imagery for such a prolonged period is challenging, because imagery is subjective, internally-driven, and thus difficult to control or access. For this reason, prior studies have focused on simple and short imagery tasks  while treating the musical-imagery experience as a series of discrete events divided by periods of rest rather than as a continuous process. Although such studies have been useful for revealing activations with simple musical imagery, findings obtained from them cannot be used to conclusively state how activated regions interact to form functional networks or what information their responses represent during complex musical imagery. 

Nonetheless, these limitations can be mitigated by using visual stimulation to guide musical imagery. Herholz   et al  . has used a karaoke-like visual display to cue subjects to imagine familiar songs for several seconds . Although this methodology has not been used for a longer period of imagery, adopting a similar idea to control sustained musical imagery by using music visualization  without lyrics may further dissociate music from language during imagery. Music visualization may enable musicians to vividly and repeatedly imagine a very complex music piece, such as a Beethoven symphony capable of arousing rich and dynamic emotion . Moreover, repeated measures of sustained musical imagery allow separation of imagery-evoked responses from ongoing activity, making it possible to disentangle the task-evoked functional networks and spontaneously emerging (i.e. task-unrelated) networks . 

In this study, we aimed to map and compare both cortical activations and functional networks during musical imagery versus perception. Unlike prior studies, we used a silent music visualization to guide experienced musicians to repeatedly imagine an 8-minute symphony in the absence of external auditory input. The visualization served to inform subjects of the music content and control the timing for the subjects’ imagery experience, to maximize subjects’ ability to imagine the music in a similar way as they listened to it. The fMRI data acquired with this paradigm were evaluated for intra-subject reproducibility and functional connectivity , to map cortical activations and functional networks under the sustained musical imagery paradigm or during the perception of musical stimulus. Moreover, we explored the information coded in the responses evoked by musical imagery and perception by correlating the fMRI signal with the time series of the auditory features of the music. Lastly, we compared imagery and perception-evoked functional networks with those in the resting state to explore the likely different patterns of network interactions during internally versus externally-driven mental processes. 


## Results 
  
### Visually-cued musical imagery evoked wide-spread cortical activation 
  
When a subject with musical training listened to an 8-min music piece eight times during the fMRI acquisition (Fig.  , left), activated cortical areas were mapped by identifying the voxels with reproducible fMRI signals across repetitions. Activated voxels were mostly confined to the auditory cortex, including the core and belt regions along the ventral auditory pathway, and Wernicke’s area (Fig.  ); the activations were slightly stronger in the right hemisphere than the left hemisphere. Whereas this was unsurprising given the auditory nature of the musical-perception task, we further asked how the brain engaged cortical processes to support musical imagery in the absence of any auditory input.   
Distinct and common cortical activations with musical perception and imagery. (  a  ) Paradigm for musical perception (left) and imagery (right). This music is in the public domain. The music score in (  a  ) was downloaded from http://www.free-scores.com/download-sheet-music.php?pdf=1220#. The visualized music shown in (  b  ) is an animation with bars moving from right to left as the music flows. It includes all the musical information as in a standard music sheet: the length of the bars indicates the note length (rhythm and duration); the height of the bars indicates the keynote (pitch); the color of the bars indicates the instrument (timbre). (  b  ) Cortical activations for musical perception (two-tailed significance level p < 0.01). (  c  ) Cortical activations for musical imagery (two-tailed significance level p < 0.005). (  d  ) Shared cortical substrates between musical perception and musical imagery (two-tailed significance level p < 0.01). The time series was extracted from the fMRI signal averaged across the perception or imagery sessions from the labelled locations (AC: Auditory cortex; ALB: Auditory anterolateral belt; PMC: Premotor cortex; FEF: Frontal eye field; IPS: Intraparietal sulcus; SMA: Supplementary motor area). 
  

To address this question, we visualized the music as a silent movie (Fig.  , right). This movie provided real-time visual cues to inform subjects of the content of musical imagery and assisted in controlling the timing of the imagery process during the 8-min session. By watching this movie, each subject could consistently imagine the music piece for 12 repeated sessions of fMRI scans. Similar to the activation analysis for musical perception, the cortical activation during the visually-cued musical imagery was mapped by assessing the intra-subject reproducibility of fMRI signals at the voxel level. The activated areas covered a large part of the cortex, including the primary visual cortex, dorsal visual areas, the parietal association cortex, the anterolateral belt, Wernicke’s area, the frontal eye fields, the supplemental motor area and the premotor cortex (Fig.  ). The responses at these areas could be attributable to either visual stimuli or musical imagery, since the task required the subject to process the visual cues as well as to imagine the music accordingly. 


### Musical imagery and perception shared common cortical substrates 
  
We further compared the task-evoked responses between the imagery and musical perception conditions. This allowed us to localize the responses to musical imagery as opposed to the visual stimuli because no visual stimuli were given during the perception condition. Since the anterolateral belt and Wernicke’s area were activated by both tasks, they were likely the shared cortical substrates for both musical perception and imagery. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the fMRI signal correlation between each musical-imagery session and each music-perception session at each voxel. This analysis revealed the areas that showed consistent responses to both tasks (Fig.  ). Such areas included Wernicke’s area on the left hemisphere and its homologous area on the right hemisphere (herein we refer to them as the bilateral Wernicke’s areas), and to a lesser degree the anterolateral belt, the supplementary motor areas, and the premotor cortex. Note that the perception task involved only auditory input but not visual input, whereas the imagery task involved only visual input but not auditory input. The voxel-wise correlation across these two task conditions was only attributable to the common music content in both conditions, regardless of whether it was actually presented or mentally recreated. As such, Fig.   reports the cortical areas that underwent the same processing during sustained musical imagery and perception. By visual inspection of the averaged fMRI signals, we found that both the imagery and perception tasks evoked complex but similar responses bilaterally in Wernicke’s areas, supplementary motor areas, and premotor cortex, over the entire duration of the music stimulus (Fig.  ). 

In four additional sessions, we also presented the music with the same visual display as used in the musical-imagery task, yielding a control condition for us to validate findings from the intra-subject reproducibility analysis. As expected, the correlation in the fMRI signal between the (auditory-only) perception condition and the (auditory and visual) control condition revealed shared activations in the auditory cortex but not in the visual cortex (Supplementary Information, Fig.  ). This was similar to the activations uncovered during auditory-only perception (Fig.  ) as the subject listened to the same music in both conditions but only watched the visualization of the music in one condition. The correlation between the (visual-only) imagery condition and the (auditory and visual) control condition revealed shared activations at both the auditory and visual cortices (Supplementary Information Fig.  ). The common activation in the visual cortex was expected because the visual stimuli drove reproducible responses at areas that processed the stimuli. However, the shared activations in Wernicke’s area and the anterolateral belt further confirmed that these two areas were involved in both musical perception and imagery, despite the presence or absence of the visual display in the musical-perception condition. 


### Consistency and variation across subjects 
  
As shown in Fig.  , the above findings observed in one subject were also reproduced in two other subjects with similar cultural and musical training backgrounds. In these subjects, the musical-imagery task was also repeated 12 times and the musical-perception task was repeated 8 times.   
Cortical activations with musical perception and imagery were consistent across all subjects. Each row indicates the cortical mapping for one subject. The first column shows the cortical activations for musical perception; the second column illustrates the cortical activations for musical imagery; the third column shows the shared cortical substrates between the two tasks. The first row (subject 1) depicts a flattened view of surface mapping as Fig.   (  b  –  d  ) (AC: Auditory cortex; ALB: Auditory anterolateral belt; PMC: Premotor cortex; FEF: Frontal eye field; IPS: Intraparietal sulcus; SMA: Supplementary motor area; V1: Primary visual cortex). 
  

Beyond single-subject analysis in these three subjects, we also generalized the findings to a larger group of eight subjects who underwent fewer sessions (two under musical perception and two under musical imagery). Although the smaller amount of repetitions reduced the statistical power and the signal to noise ratio in each subject, the intra-subject correlations within and between perception and imagery sessions based on a set of regions of interest (ROIs) were averaged across subjects to reveal the group-level effects. In general, the group-level results revealed a similar set of activated regions as those obtained at the single subject levels (Figs   and  ): the auditory core and belt areas, bilateral Wernicke’s areas, and the left premotor cortex were activated during musical perception; while bilateral Wernicke’s area, auditory anterolateral belts, premotor cortices, Intraparietal sulcus, left supplementary motor area and left frontal eye field were activated during musical imagery (Fig.  ). The overall activations in left hemisphere are more consistent across all subjects than those in the right hemisphere. Particularly, the correlation between musical perception and imagery was most pronounced in Wernicke’s area in the left hemisphere, suggesting that its role in musical imagery was most reliable and consistent across subjects.

### Responses at Wernicke’s areas coded music-timbre features during musical imagery 
  
We further asked what musical information was preserved in the brain during musical imagery. To address this question, we explored a specific auditory feature known as the spectral flux. This feature measures how quickly the power spectrum of a sound wave changes over time , and it reflects the music timbre . As shown in Fig.  , extracting the spectral flux from the music stimulus resulted in a time series that represented a timbre-related auditory feature in the music. After convolving the spectral flux with the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to produce its assumed signature in the fMRI signal, this feature time series was correlated to the real fMRI signal at each voxel during musical imagery. A finding consistent across subjects was that the significantly correlated areas included ventral visual areas and Wernicke’s areas in both hemispheres (Fig.  , bottom). The former was not surprising since the visual cues changed according to the content of the music. The latter was interesting, because the Wernicke’s area was not directly involved in visual processing. The correlation between the activity at Wernicke’s area and the spectral-flux fluctuation implied that Wernicke’s area represented auditory information during musical imagery, despite the absence of acoustic stimuli. During musical perception, the spectral-flux fluctuation was also correlated with the activity in Wernicke’s areas, as well as in the core and belt areas in the auditory cortex (Fig.  , top). Nevertheless, Wernicke’s area was the only area that was correlated to the spectral-flux feature in both musical perception and musical imagery. Similar observations were obtained when a different musical feature was extracted from the amplitude envelope of the sound – another important feature for music timbre  (see Supplementary Information Fig.  ). Taken together, these results suggest the auditory nature of neural coding in Wernicke’s area during both musical perception and imagery.   
Responses at Wernicke’s areas coded musical features during imagery. (  a  ) The auditory spectral flux was extracted from the stimulus spectrogram as a feature showing how quickly the power spectrum of a sound wave changes over time. (  b  ) Spectral flux was highly correlated with the fMRI signals (averaged across all subjects) in the common cortical regions shared between musical perception and imagery (corrected at false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05), especially in ventral visual areas and bilaterally in Wernicke’s areas (as circled on the maps). 
  


### Musical imagery and perception evoked highly distinctive cortical networks 
  
We also explored how the brain engaged its functional networks to support musical imagery and perception. For this purpose, we mapped and compared the task-evoked patterns of functional connectivity during the musical imagery versus during the music perception task. This analysis was based on seed-based inter-session functional connectivity , which isolates task-evoked responses that are reproducible and correlated across different sessions of the same task , becuase spontaneous activity is independent of the task and thus uncorrelated across sessions. In this regard, four seed locations were chosen bilaterally from Wernicke’s areas and anterolateral belts, because these areas were activated by both the musical imagery and perception tasks. Notably, the task-evoked patterns of seed-based functional connectivity were highly distinctive between the musical-perception task and the musical-imagery task (Fig.  ). In contrast to the unimodal network involved in musical perception (Fig.  , left), musical imagery recruited a much broader and more complex pattern of network interactions (Fig.  , middle). During musical imagery, the four seed locations were positively correlated with the attention network (including the intraparietal sulcus and the frontal eye fields) and the motor-control network in the prefrontal cortex (including the supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex), but negatively correlated with the default-mode network (including the posterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobule, medial and lateral prefrontal cortices). Both the correlated and anti-correlated networks were largely symmetric between the two hemispheres. Although the network patterns appeared distinct between musical imagery and perception, the correlations between Wernicke’s areas and the anterolateral belt cortex were noticeable in both of the tasks.   
Task-evoked cortical network versus intrinsic network. The perception-evoked (first column) and imagery-evoked (second-column) cortical networks were mapped by cross-session seed-based correlation in the task-related fMRI signals. The third column is the intrinsic network mapped with resting-state fMRI. Each row corresponds to one specific seed location (circled on the maps), labelled on the left. (AC: Auditory cortex; ALB: Auditory anterolateral belt; PMC: Premotor cortex; IPS: Intraparietal sulcus; SMA: Supplementary motor area; IPL: Inferior Parietal Lobule; DLPFC: Dorsal Lateral Prefrontal Cortex; VLPFC: Ventral Lateral Prefrontal Cortex). 
  

We further asked whether the patterns of network interactions during musical imagery or perception reflected the intrinsic functional connectivity during the resting state in the absence of any task. The resting state networks were consistent with the networks evoked by musical perception (Fig.  , right). However, the networks evoked by musical imagery were not confined to any single intrinsic network; instead they involved complex interactions of multiple networks, including higher-order auditory networks, the attention network, the motor-control network, and the default-mode network. 



## Discussion 
  
In this study, we introduced a new experimental paradigm to map and compare cortical activations and networks in musicians during sustained and complex musical imagery versus during musical perception. During visually-cued musical imagery, subjects watched a movie and accordingly imagined a specific music piece. Wernicke’s area and its homologous area in the right hemisphere facilitated the re-creation of the auditory features of the music, giving rise to vivid musical imagery resembling the experience of actually listening to music. Although Wernicke’s area was involved in both musical imagery and perception, its interactions with other brain regions appeared to be highly different between these two conditions: musical imagery elicited much more widespread, complex, and multi-modal networks, whereas musical perception recruited intrinsic and unimodal networks. The most notable network signature of musical imagery was the anti-correlation between the default-model network and task positive networks for attention or motor control. 

### Music visualization facilitates repeated measures of sustained musical imagery 
  
Mental imagery is a subjective human experience that is hard to control and measure. Previous studies have mostly utilized experimental paradigms to acquire short periods of musical imagery alternating with other conditions, e.g. musical perception and resting state . Although such paradigms are convenient for mapping cortical activations with musical imagery, they do not allow repeated observations of brain activity during sustained musical imagery task such that patterns of task-evoked network interactions can be mapped. 

Unique to this study is the use of music visualization to control the timing and inform the content of complex and sustained musical imagery. The visualization uses a similar concept as Karaoke, enabling subjects to imagine the same music with a controlled tempo. This allows for repeated measures of the same imagery experience within and across subjects, so that the fMRI scans can be compared across sessions to map the imagery-evoked activations and networks, as previously demonstrated in studies for natural vision or hearing . Moreover, this stimulus paradigm also allows direct comparison of the fMRI signals between imagery and perception to map their shared cortical representations. 

In addition to the purpose of mapping imagery-evoked activations and networks, this visually-cued imagery paradigm also offers a new opportunity to study neural coding for imagery. Many musical features can be predicted by decoding fMRI data from subjects listening to music ; however, it is very difficult to develop or evaluate methods for decoding musical imagery. In general, brain decoding methods require extensive data for training and testing decoding models . Such data are currently unavailable for mental imagery because the content of imagery is unsynchronized, complex, and inaccessible. Thus, it is desirable to experimentally control the imagery content to allow for synchronized and repeated brain activity measurements to generate data for rigorously training and testing decoding models, before attempting to apply them to more complex forms of imagery or cognitive processes, such as dreams . 


### Musical imagery involves bilateral Wernicke’s areas 
  
Our results suggest that two areas are essential to musical imagery: the anterolateral belt and Wernicke’s area. As a part of the ventral auditory pathway, the anterolateral belt is likely involved in the recognition of the sound information during musical imagery. However, it was unexpected that Wernicke’s areas were bilaterally activated with similar responses during musical imagery and perception (Fig.  ). Wernicke’s area is conventionally considered to be responsible for language processing and comprehension . However, the stimulus in this study was a recording of classical music without lyrics, and did not involve language per se. Therefore, the response in Wernicke’s area was unlikely to reflect language processing during either musical imagery or processing. This finding led us to speculate the functional role of Wernicke’s area beyond language . 

In fact, music and language are both carried by sequential inputs with hierarchical syntactic structures . The syntax in language refers to the principles of grouping words into phrase, and phrases into sentence. Likewise, the syntax in music refers to the principles of combining tones into chords, and chords into harmony . Given their syntactic similarities, language and music processing might utilize a partly shared set of neural substrates . Among them, Wernicke’s area is likely responsible for general syntax processing of sequences for language as well as music, as the information is represented through similarly hierarchical syntactic integration . 

It is conventionally thought that music is processed by the right hemisphere, whereas speech is processed by the left hemisphere . However, such hemispheric specialization has been challenged by findings from recent functional imaging studies, which suggest involvement of both hemispheres in music perception . Our results support and extend this notion by further demonstrating that both hemispheres are involved in not only musical perception but also in musical imagery. It also turns out that music processing activates the networks rather symmetrically in both hemispheres. Future studies are desirable to explore the potentially distinctive roles of the left and right hemispheres during musical imagery. 


### Wernicke’s area encodes music timbre information during musical imagery 
  
In this study, the response in Wernicke’s area was highly correlated with music timbre features of the stimulus as imagined or heard (Fig.   and Supplementary Information Fig.  ). This observation offers insights about the previously undiscovered function of Wernicke’s area. At least in musicians, Wernicke’s area may encode musical information, whether it is internally generated (imagery) or externally stimulated (perception), beyond its known function in language comprehension . 

The musical information represented by the activity of Wernicke’s area reflected low level features of the sound, such as spectral or amplitude fluctuations. During musical imagery, the sound was not present; therefore, the mentally-generated acoustic features were likely driven through top-down processes, as opposed to bottom-up processes that occurred when the sound was physically presented. In this context, the top-down and bottom-up processes involved distinct areas and networks. When the music was presented externally as a sound wave, its processing involved the primary auditory cortex and the ventral auditory pathway. In contrast, when the music was imagined in mind, the primary auditory cortex was not involved in representing the music (Fig.  ). This distinction suggests that the primary auditory cortex encodes the auditory features of a music only when it is perceived and not when it is imagined . 


### Musical imagery requires complex interactions among multiple intrinsic networks 
  
Although Wernicke’s area encoded auditory features of music for both musical imagery and musical perception, its functional connectivity appeared largely different in these two conditions (Fig.  ). In the musical perception task, Wernicke’s area interacted with the auditory cortices bilaterally, showing a pattern of task-evoked functional connectivity consistent with the intrinsic functional network in the resting state. However, during musical imagery, Wernicke’s area engaged itself in a more complex pattern of functional connectivity, which included a subset of the auditory network, the attention network, and the default-mode network. 

This finding is intuitively reasonable, as musical perception is a more natural and less demanding task than musical imagery. The high attention demand during musical imagery explains the positive interaction between Wernicke’s area and the attention network . It also explains the negative interaction with the default-mode network, which tends to be deactivated by attention-demanding tasks  and anti-correlated with task-positive networks at rest . Moreover, the auditory network evoked by musical imagery did not cover the whole auditory cortex; it only included Wernicke’s area and the anterolateral belt, and excluded the primary auditory cortex. This musical-imagery evoked network was notably different from the intrinsic auditory network observed in the resting state and from the task-evoked auditory network during musical perception. The absence of the primary auditory cortex in musical-imagery evoked network is consistent with findings from majority of the previous studies , but not Kraemer   et al  . , though this topic remains under debate. 

Moreover, our results demonstrate that task-evoked functional networks may differ from intrinsic functional networks in the resting state, despite a general correspondence between them . A task-evoked network may segregate up an intrinsic network to involve a subset of regions, or it may recruit multiple intrinsic networks through network-network interactions. The degree to which a task-evoked network corresponds to its intrinsic mode may directly depend on how natural and frequent a type of tasks occur in realistic experiences (listening to music is more naturalistic than imagining music) or may inversely depend on the cognitive load of the task. 


### Supplementary and premotor motor areas are involved in musical imagery 
  
In this study, the supplementary motor areas and the premotor cortex were activated during musical imagery, confirming findings in previous studies . Since the musical-imagery task did not involve any movement and all subjects reported no humming or other vocalizations, the activations of these motor-related areas were unlikely to be attributed to movements, but resulted from the mental imagery state. In line with this interpretation, the supplementary motor areas and the premotor cortex were activated with imagery, whereas the primary motor cortex was not. However, we did not explicitly monitor vocal or sub-vocal movement (e.g. with EMG recordings), and thus could not entirely exclude the possibility of all kinds of vocalization. 

Sensory and motor experiences are often linked to one another . When playing an instrument, a musician reads music scores and controls fine motor movements to produce sound; the sound provides feedback for the musician to refine motor control . Such sensorimotor interactions might also occur during musical imagery, involving a motor-control circuit in the prefrontal cortex, including supplementary motor and premotor areas. The motor-control network activated with musical imagery (Fig.  ) appears to be similar to the network activated with motor imagery . Thus, it is plausible that motor imagery (subvocal silent singing of notes or imagery of finger movements during music performing) may occur during musical imagery in musicians, or even during non-musical auditory imagery . 


### Musicians versus non-musicians 
  
Musical imagery is not unique to musicians, and it is a common human experience that may even occur involuntarily to most people . However, research on musical imagery has often tested musicians and non-musicians in separate studies, since musical-imagery tasks for musicians may be too difficult for non-musicians to complete . For example, musicians are able to mentally imagine the temporal reversal of familiar melodies , which is hardly possible for non-musicians. Likewise, the imagery task based on music visualization is also very difficult for non-musicians to perform, limiting the scope of this study to musicians with a long history of musical training. 

Musicians and non-musicians may process and understand musical information in distinctive ways. For musicians, “reading the visualized music” or “hearing the music” might involve similar cognitive processes as reading and processing the musical note – the “language” specialized to music as a result of their musical training and knowledge. Musicians may also generate vivid imagery during silent reading of music scores, namely “notational audiation”. Previous studies have shown that this specific type of musical imagery may trigger both auditory and motor imagery in musicians . The motor imagery may come from the subvocal silent singing of notes, or the manual motor imagery of performing instruments. In this study, we used a similar paradigm as “notational audiation”, except that our visualization of music was more intuitive and better controlled in timing. All subjects in this study were musicians with a long history of musical training or practice. They all reported experiencing vivid musical imagery during experiments, and could imagine the music with accurate tempo and pitch in mind. Some even reported being able to imagine the instruments being played during mental imagery of the Beethoven symphony. The visually-cued imagery task in this study may also elicit the engagement of sensorimotor interactions and even motor imagery (as discussed in previous section). 

Musicians often outperform non-musicians not only during musical imagery tasks  but also during non-musical auditory imagery tasks . Previous functional neuroimaging study found enlarged auditory cortical representation in musicians, and the enlargement of tonotopic maps was correlated with their ages of starting musical training . Our results also suggest that both musical imagery and perception evoke bilateral activations and networks in musicians. Recent evidence suggests that this breakdown of lateralization is more likely to be observed in musicians . Since all participants in this study were trained musicians, we could not contrast our observations in musicians against non-musicians. As a result, we speculate, but do not assert, any causal relationship between musical training and imagery ability. 



## Methods and Materials 
  
### Subjects and Stimuli 
  
Nine healthy volunteers (Age 19–27, 3 females, all right-handed with normal hearing and on average 10.9 years of musical training; see Table   for subject details) participated in the study with informed written consent obtained from each subject according to a research protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at Purdue University. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations as described in this approved protocol. Here, we focused on musicians because the task of imagining a long piece of classic music (elaborated as below) was rather difficult for non-musicians. Otherwise, inclusion of data from any subjects who were unable to perform the musical-imagery task would complicate the study, of which the main goal was to map cortical activations and networks underlying musical imagery. For this reason, any findings from this study were specifically confined to musicians with a long-term musical training.   
Subject information. This table shows the information of all 9 subjects regarding their gender, age, handedness and musical training experience. 
  

As illustrated in Fig.   (left), the auditory stimulus was the first 8 minutes of the first movement of Beethoven’s Symphony 9 (sampling rate: 11025 Hz), delivered through binaural MR-compatible headphones (Silent Scan Audio Systems, Avotec, Stuart, FL). This music piece was visualized as a movie through Stephen Malinowski’s Music Animation Machine . The visualization is a graphic music score based on the design of a 2-dimension piano roll. As illustrated in Fig.   (right), it is an animation with rectangular bars moving from right to left as the music flows; the current note is the highlighted bar in the middle of the screen. Each subject imagined the music while watching the movie visualizing music. The movie offered real-time visual cues to control the timing and inform the content of musical imagery. The visualized music was delivered through a binocular goggle system (NordicNeuroLab Visual System, Bergen, Norway) using Psychophysics Toolbox 3 ( ). 

Prior to fMRI, each subject was trained for 1 to 2 hours, to become familiar with the music visualization and imagery task. For the purposes of this study, 1 to 2 hours of training was sufficient, as the visualization was intuitive for musicians . The subjects were instructed to report the vividness of their musical imagery based on a 1–5 scale (1 not at all; 5 very accurate). All subjects were able to vividly imagine the music, and self-reported 4.1 ± 0.6 for the accuracy of pitches, 4.7 ± 0.5 for the accuracy of tempo and 3.8 ± 0.9 for the accuracy of distinguishing different instruments. However, it should be noted that the above self-reporting by itself only provided subjective assessment of musical imagery, and could not be taken as fully objective evidence for the existence and vividness of musical imagery. Despite its limitation, the self-reported scores still offered reasonable support for the presence of musical imagery. Also note that the self-reported scores were not used in the fMRI analysis. So, the (subjective) behavioral assessment and the imaging-based evidence were entirely independent of each other. 


### Experiment 
  
In the musical perception sessions, each subject was instructed to listen to this music with his or her eyes closed while no movie was presented. During the musical imagery sessions, each subject was instructed to imagine the music piece while watching the silent music visualization. Three subjects performed the musical-perception task eight times and the musical-imagery task twelve times. The perception and imagery session order was counterbalanced but not randomized across subjects. The sessions were conducted over a period of five days; two perception sessions and two imagery sessions in each of the first four days; four imagery sessions in the fifth day. The purpose of the high number of repetitions was to reliably examine the cortical activations and networks evoked by each task separately and shared by both tasks at the individual-subject level. This was especially desirable for the imagery task, which was cognitively demanding and likely involved complex cortical processes that were more variable across subjects than the perception task. The other six subjects underwent two repetitions of the perception task intermixed with two repetitions of the imagery tasks in a single day. Among these six subjects, one subject was excluded due to excessive head motion during fMRI scans. Despite the limited repetitions of the latter subjects, data from these subjects, as well as from two sessions of data arbitrarily chosen from the first three subjects, served the purpose of mapping cortical activations and networks during musical perception and imagery at the group level. 

Each of the first three subjects also underwent six sessions of resting-state fMRI on a different day. In each session, the subjects were instructed to rest for 8 minutes with the eyes closed, without falling into sleep. Since the resting-state sessions were long separated (by days) from the tasks of musical perception or imagery, it was unlikely that the subjects were conditioned to “play the music in their heads” with a similar temporal precision without any instruction by the researchers. 


### MRI Acquisition and Preprocessing 
  
MRI data were acquired in a 3 T MRI system (Signa HDx, General Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee) with a 16-channel receive-only phase-array surface coil (NOVA Medical, Wilmington). Structural MRI with T1 and T2-weighted contrast were both acquired with 1 mm isotropic resolution. Functional MRI data were acquired using a single-shot, gradient-recalled echo-planar imaging sequence with 3.5 mm isotropic spatial resolution and 2 second temporal resolution (38 interleaved axial slices with 3.5 mm thickness and 3.5 × 3.5 mm  in-plane resolution, TR/TE = 2000/35ms, flip angle = 78°, field of view = 22 × 22 cm ). Each subject was scanned with fMRI for 26 sessions: 8 sessions during the musical perception task, 12 under the visually-cued musical imagery task, and 6 in the wakeful eyes-closed resting state. Each session was 8 minutes in length. 

MRI/fMRI images were preprocessed using a similar pipeline as in the Human Connectome Project . Briefly, all fMRI images were corrected for slice timing and motion, aligned to structural images, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, transformed onto individual cortical surfaces, and then co-registered based on myelin density and cortical folding patterns. Following this step, slow trends in the fMRI time series were corrected by regressing out a fourth-order polynomial function. Then fMRI data were temporally standardized (with a zero mean and unitary variance) and spatially smoothed by applying a 2-D Gaussian kernel of 2 mm full width at half maximum. 


### Mapping cortical activations during musical perception or imagery 
  
For the three subjects who underwent the greater number of repetitions, we mapped cortical activations during musical perception and imagery. For each task, intra-subject reproducibility was calculated at voxel-level, as previously used for measuring the reliability of cortical activity during naturalistic stimulation elsewhere . This reproducibility was measured separately for each voxel as the temporal correlation between different sessions of the same task: 28 inter-session pairs among 8 sessions for the perception task and 66 inter-session pairs among 12 sessions for the imagery task. To handle the dependences among the different inter-session pairs for assessing statistical significance test, we applied a parametric statistical test to the intra-subject reproducibility based on linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling  implemented in AFNI ( ). Specifically, the Fisher-transformed inter-session correlation   z   is expressed in a crossed random-effects model, where   b   is the effect of interest, the average correlation across all inter-session pairs,   θ   and   θ   are the random effects associated with the   i  th and   j  th sessions, respectively,   ε   is the residual term,   i, j   = 1, 2, …, 8 (for perception), and i,   j   = 1, 2, …, 12 (for imagery). Using this approach, we localized the brain areas significantly activated during musical perception (p < 0.01) and musical imagery (p < 0.005). See more details about the LME in a recent paper by Chen   et al  . . 

To test this effect at the group level, we used data from the group of eight subjects, for whom each underwent two sessions of musical imagery and two sessions of musical perception from each subject. We defined regions of interest (ROI) based on the multi-modal parcellation of human cerebral cortex , namely primary auditory cortex (A1), auditory anterolateral belt (ALB), Wernicke’s area, supplementary motor area(SMA), premotor cortex (PMC), frontal eye field (FEF), intraparietal sulcus (IPS) (see more details regarding the size and center location of each ROI in Table  ). For each subject, the fMRI signals from the same session were first averaged within every ROI. Intra-subject reproducibility was evaluated for each ROI by correlating the averaged fMRI signals between repeated sessions of the same task and then converted to z scores. Then, the reproducibility was averaged across subjects, and evaluated for statistical significance using a one-sample t-test (p < 0.05). This analysis was done separately for the musical-imagery task and the musical-perception task.   
ROI information. This table shows the information including the name, size and center location of each ROI for group-level analyses (A1: Primary auditory cortex; ALB: Auditory anterolateral belt; SMA: Supplementary motor area; PMC: Premotor cortex; FEF: Frontal eye field; IPS: Intraparietal sulcus). Size refers to the number of voxels within each ROI. The vertex index of the center voxel for each ROI is extracted from the standard 32k vertex surface meshes of Human Connectome Project . We also used the anatomical xyz-coordinates (mm) in the MNI space to indicate the location of the center voxel in each ROI. 
  


### Mapping the common activations between musical perception and imagery 
  
For each subject, we also mapped the cortical regions where the musical perception and imagery tasks evoked the same response. For this purpose, we calculated for each voxel’s the temporal correlation between each perception session and each imagery session. As such, the cross-task correlation was measured for a total of 96 pairs of sessions given 8 perception sessions and 12 imagery sessions. The significance of cross-task correlation was evaluated for each subject, based on a crossed random-effects LME model , where   κ   and   λ   are the random effects are associated with the   i  th session of perception and the   j  th session of imagery, respectively,   i   = 1, 2, …, 8, and   j   = 1, 2, …, 12. From this approach, we located the brain areas in which activities were significantly shared between musical perception and musical imagery (p < 0.01). 

We also performed the ROI-based group-level analysis on the eight additional subjects; for each subject,  data were available from two sessions of musical imagery and two sessions of musical perception. Using the method described in the previous sub-section, we evaluated the intra-subject correlation between musical imagery and perception for each ROI, converted the correlation coefficients to z scores and then averaged them across subjects. The statistical significance for the group-averaged effect was tested using a one-sample t-test (p < 0.05). 

For one subject, we also mapped the cortical regions in which the (auditory-only) musical perception and (visual display only) imagery tasks evoked the similar responses during the control condition (perception with visual display). For this purpose, we calculated the temporal correlation in the voxel time series between 1) each perception and each control session at each voxel and 2) each imagery session and each control session at each voxel, in a similar manner as how the mapping of the common activations between musical perception and imagery was performed. The significance of the cross-task correlation was evaluated for each subject using the crossed random-effects LME model  as Eq. ( ). 


### Mapping the fMRI correlates to auditory feature time series 
  
We further explored the musical content coded in the fMRI response. For this purpose, the spectral flux and amplitude envelope of the music stimulus (in the auditory form) was extracted by the MIRtoolbox in Matlab . Both spectral flux and amplitude envelope are important sound features for music timbre. Spectral flux measures the change in the power spectrum of a signal, which is calculated as the 2-norm (also known as the Euclidean distance) between the normalized spectra from adjacent frames . The envelope shows the global outer shape of the signal, which can detect musical events such as notes. The feature frame size was set to 1 second with a step size of 0.1 second. The auditory feature time series were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) . The resulting time series were correlated with the fMRI signal at every voxel. For both the musical imagery and perception tasks, the correlation was calculated after the voxel time series was averaged across all the repeated sessions of the same task. A one-sample t test was applied to localize the brain areas that were significantly correlated with the auditory features during perception (corrected at false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05) and imagery (corrected at false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05). 


### Mapping task-evoked networks during musical perception and imagery 
  
For the three subjects in which a higher number repetitions were conducted, we mapped the task-evoked patterns of functional connectivity during both the musical perception and the imagery task using a seed-based inter-session correlation analysis . Specifically, the time series at a particular seed location was taken from one session; then, the seed time series was correlated with every voxel time series during a different session of the same task. Four seed locations were chosen: 1) in the left Wernicke’s area, 2) in the right Wernicke’s area, 3) in the left Auditory anterolateral belt, and 4) in the right Auditory anterolateral belt. These choices were based on activated regions for both musical perception and imagery, as highlighted in our results (Fig.  ). The inter-session functional connectivity was evaluated for each pair of distinct sessions of the same task. The significance of inter-session functional connectivity was also evaluated using the LME method . See Eq. ( ). 

For each subject, we further compared the task-evoked networks with intrinsic functional networks observed with resting-state fMRI. Seed-based correlations of the spontaneous activity were mapped in the same seed locations as mentioned above. Briefly, the voxel time series were concatenated across the six resting state sessions for each subject, and temporal correlations were calculated using the concatenated data. The statistical significance was evaluated using two-tailed one-sample t-tests (corrected at false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.01).

# Abstract
 
Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a learning disability affecting the acquisition of numerical-arithmetical skills. Studies report persistent deficits in number processing and aberrant functional activation of the fronto-parietal numerical network in DD. However, the neural development of numerical abilities has been scarcely investigated. The present paper provides a first attempt to investigate behavioral and neural trajectories of numerical abilities longitudinally in typically developing (TD) and DD children. During a study period of 4 years, 28 children (8–11 years) were evaluated twice by means of neuropsychological tests and a numerical order fMRI paradigm. Over time, TD children improved in numerical abilities and showed a consistent and well-developed fronto-parietal network. In contrast, DD children revealed persistent deficits in number processing and arithmetic. Brain imaging results of the DD group showed an age-related activation increase in parietal regions (intraparietal sulcus), pointing to a delayed development of number processing areas. Besides, an activation increase in frontal areas was observed over time, indicating the use of compensatory mechanisms. In conclusion, results suggest a continuation in neural development of number representation in DD, whereas the neural network for simple ordinal number estimation seems to be stable or show only subtle changes in TD children over time.

## Introduction 
  
How does the “numerical brain” develop? Numbers are omnipresent in our lives and our innate ability to detect small numerosities enables us to develop complex mathematical skills at a young age (Starkey et al.,  ; Xu and Spelke,  ; Izard et al.,  ). Not surprisingly, individuals with Developmental Dyscalculia (DD) struggle in their everyday life. DD is a learning disability affecting the acquisition of numerical-arithmetical skills in children with normal intelligence and age-appropriate school education (WHO,  ). Many studies have shown that children with DD display various deficits in number processing skills such as magnitude processing or spatial number representation (Landerl et al.,  ; Rousselle and Noël,  ; Mussolin et al.,  ; Landerl,  ). Those skills are assumed to predict later arithmetical achievement (Halberda et al.,  ; De Smedt et al.,  ; Geary et al.,  ; Träff,  ) and are therefore essential for the development of numeracy. DD has a high prevalence (3–7%) (Gross-Tsur et al.,  ; Wyschkon et al.,  ; Reigosa-Crespo et al.,  ) and a persisting character (Shalev et al.,  ,  ). The fact that difficulties in numeracy result in reduced employment opportunities and high public costs underscores the importance of understanding more about numerical brain development (Parsons and Bynner,  ; Gross,  ). 

Research performed over the last decades demonstrates that from the first day after birth, infants are capable of discriminating quantities (Xu et al.,  ; Izard et al.,  ) and show specialized neuronal correlates for the processing of numerosities early in development (Hyde et al.,  ; Hyde and Spelke,  ). Over development, a spatial representation of quantity and numbers, also known as mental number line (Berch et al.,  ; Dehaene,  ), emerges. With the acquisition of number words and the symbolic number system, the formation of such an internal representation further refines (Siegler and Booth,  ; von Aster and Shalev,  ; Ebersbach et al.,  ; Halberda and Feigenson,  ). Moreover, numerical magnitude processing skills (linearity of the mental number line, performance in quantity comparison tasks) correlate with arithmetical knowledge and predict future mathematical achievement (Booth and Siegler,  ; De Smedt et al.,  ). A recent study further showed that number line estimation is a good predictor of arithmetic ability at an early age, whilst ordinal processing of numerical symbols was revealed to be a strong predictor of older children's arithmetical skills (Lyons et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ). Besides various other deficits in numerical-arithmetical skills, several studies with DD children reported that they are less accurate in placing numbers on a number line (Geary et al.,  ; Landerl,  ). Piazza et al. ( ) showed that DD children performed at a similar level as 5-years-younger typically developing (TD) children in a task measuring number representation. Furthermore, results of a review reveal that weak performance of magnitude processing skills correlates with low mathematical achievement and DD (De Smedt et al.,  ). These results are supported by neuroimaging findings demonstrating that children with DD show aberrant functional activation in number tasks compared to TD peers. Significantly reduced activation is mainly found in domain-specific regions of the parietal lobe, known to be important for magnitude and ordinal processing and supposed to incorporate the mental number line (Kucian et al.,  ,  ; Price et al.,  ; Mussolin et al.,  ; Ashkenazi et al.,  ). For instance, children with DD showed reduced activation in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and superior parietal lobe when solving a number processing task (Kucian et al.,  ). Moreover, when confronted with arithmetical problems, DD children failed to show a task related modulation in parietal areas. However, findings are not consistent and some studies describe increased activation in DD in these areas (Davis et al.,  ; Kaufmann et al.,  ,  ). Rosenberg-Lee et al. ( ), for instance, reported that children with DD show hyper-activation in parietal cortices when solving subtraction problems. Moreover, activation differences are also found in domain-general regions mainly in the frontal brain, attributed to working memory, attention and planning, but also in occipito-temporal areas of the brain (Kucian et al.,  ,  ; Price et al.,  ; Davis et al.,  ; Kaufmann et al.,  ; Rosenberg-Lee et al.,  ). Recent studies further revealed that children with DD show functional hyper-connectivity of the IPS with the bilateral fronto-parietal network (Jolles et al.,  ; Michels et al.,  ). To summarize, these findings describing an aberrant brain activation pattern possibly reflect the typical deficiency in number processing and the greater cognitive resources needed to solve numerical tasks. 

A number of cross-sectional studies have been conducted to investigate age dependent neural differences of numerical functions in TD children. Findings suggest that children activate similar regions to adults when solving numerical tasks (Peters and De Smedt,  ). However, children recruit parietal regions to a lesser extent, in particular the IPS, and show increased frontal activation compared to adults (Ansari et al.,  ; Ansari and Dhital,  ; Cantlon et al.,  ; Kucian et al.,  ; Holloway and Ansari,  ). According to these findings, researchers hypothesized that there is a shift from an initially controlled and effortful (frontal activation) to a subsequently more automatic processing of numerical magnitude (parietal activation) (Ansari et al.,  ; Rivera et al.,  ; Kucian et al.,  ; Holloway and Ansari,  ). Conversely, Rosenberg-Lee et al. ( ) reported an increase in parietal, but also prefrontal and visuo-temporal regions over 1 year in children solving arithmetic problems, suggesting a nonlinear trajectory of development. 

Several behavioral long-term studies investigated the development of typical and atypical number processing (such as dot enumeration, counting, and number comparison), showing that its efficiency is a good predictor for arithmetical achievement (Halberda et al.,  ; Desoete et al.,  ; Geary et al.,  ; Passolunghi and Lanfranchi,  ; Landerl,  ; Reigosa-Crespo et al.,  ; Träff,  ). Landerl ( ) followed children's numerical abilities over 2 years and found that even if dyscalculic children showed improvements, numerical processing remains persistently deficient. This is also in line with the results of a systematic review about longitudinal studies of mathematical difficulties indicating that students with math difficulty improve in mathematical measures over time but do not catch up to their peers (Nelson and Powell,  ). Further studies revealed that those deficits are already detectable in kindergarten and continue to persist into adolescence (Shalev et al.,  ,  ; Stock et al.,  ; Geary et al.,  ; Mazzocco et al.,  ). 

To date, the current body of research has identified a substantial deficit in numerical processing in children with DD. Studies with TD subjects indicate that there is a functional specialization in the areas devoted to numerical magnitude representation and involved in the development of the mental number line. On the neural level, DD is associated with aberrant activation patterns of the number-specific parietal regions and domain-general areas. Nevertheless, little is known about the neural development of numerical abilities. 

Hence, the goal of the present study was to investigate the typical and atypical neural development of numerical abilities by means of longitudinal functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and behavioral data. With fMRI we investigated the ordinal aspect of number processing, as differences between DD and TD children have been reported in parietal and domain general regions during a numerical order task (Kucian et al.,  ). In addition, ordinal number processing has been shown to be an important predictor for arithmetic skills as development progresses (Lyons et al.,  ). Together with behavioral measures on the spatial representation of quantity and numbers (number line task) we aimed to provide insight into the development of numerical abilities. 

Evidence from studies with TD children and adults revealed a shift from frontal to parietal activation over time. Based on this literature, we expect to find an increase in activation in the number-specific parietal regions and a decrease in the domain-general regions reflecting the growing proficiency in number processing in TD children (Ansari and Dhital,  ; Cantlon et al.,  ; Holloway and Ansari,  ). To our knowledge there are no studies about the neuro-functional development of children with DD, making predictions about the atypical development difficult. However, studies show that children and adults with DD show aberrant activation in the number-specific parietal areas (Molko et al.,  ; Kucian et al.,  ,  ; Kaufmann et al.,  ). Furthermore, longitudinal behavioral findings show that children with DD show persistent deficits in numerical processing (Geary et al.,  ; Landerl,  ; Nelson and Powell,  ). In line with these findings, we hypothesize a persistent deficiency in numerical processing and consistently lower parietal activity in children with DD compared to TD children (Kucian et al.,  ,  ; Price et al.,  ). As we predict persistent aberrant parietal activity, but at the same time improvements in number processing (Landerl,  ; Nelson and Powell,  ), we further expect to find higher frontal activation over time in DD children reflecting the changes in the requirement of the cognitive resources as a result of a delayed development. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Study design and participants 
  
In this longitudinal study, a group of children with DD and a group of TD children were evaluated by neuropsychological tests and fMRI (baseline). After 4.2 (SD = 0.46) years, children returned for a second neuropsychological and fMRI assessment (follow-up) (Figure  ). 
  
Study design. Overview of the behavioral tests and fMRI task performed at baseline and after 4.2 years at follow-up. ZAREKI-R, Neuropsychological Test Battery for Number Processing and Calculation in Children; BASIS-MATH 4–8, Basic Diagnostic in Mathematics for Grades 4–8; KFT 4–12, Cognitive Abilities Test; WISC, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; BTT, Block-Tapping-Test; TAP, Testbattery for Attentional Performance; SLRT-II, Salzburg Reading and Orthography Test. 
  
In total 35 (23 DD, 12 TD) children between 8 and 11 years were recruited into this study, of which 25 took part in a previous study (Kucian et al.,  ) (Note that while the previous study acquired data both before and after number line training, only the pre-training data from this previous study were included as a baseline measurement for the present study. Therefore, all children included in the present study participated for the first time in a study at our MRI center and performed the same behavioral tests and fMRI paradigm). Inclusion criteria for all children were an IQ > 85 and no history of a neurologic or psychiatric disorder. Additionally, DD children had to perform below the 10th percentile in the total score or three subtests of a standardized numerical test battery (ZAREKI-R) at baseline. TD children required age-appropriate mathematical performance at baseline and follow-up, defined as performing above the 10th percentile in the ZAREKI-R (range of the TD children: PR 46-100) and above the cut-off of 67 points in the BASIS-MATH 4-8 (range of the TD children: 68–83) (see also Figure   and Supplementary Material). According to these criteria, six DD children were excluded because they exceeded the cut-off in the numerical test and one TD child because of medication. Therefore, the behavioral data analyses are based on 17 DD and 11 TD children. 

For the fMRI analysis, three data sets at baseline and seven at follow-up were excluded because of task performance < 50% (1 data set), scanner problems (3 data sets) or poor image quality caused by dental braces (6 data sets). Hence, subsequent statistical group comparisons are based on 14 DD and 11 TD fMRI data sets at baseline, and 13 DD and 8 TD fMRI data sets at follow-up. 

Informed and written consent was obtained from participants when older than 16 years and all parents. The study was approved by the Ethics committee of Zurich, Switzerland based on guidelines from the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki (WMA,  ). 


### Behavioral testing 
  
All children completed age-appropriated neuropsychological tests at baseline and follow-up (for an overview see Figure  ). 

#### Handedness 
  
Handedness (3 left handed, 8 ambidextrous, 17 right handed) was determined by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield,  ). 


#### Diagnosis of DD and general numerical abilities 
  
At baseline, numerical abilities were assessed using the revised version of the Neuropsychological Test Battery for Number Processing and Calculation in Children (ZAREKI-R) (von Aster et al.,  ). This test battery consists of 12 subtests assessing basic numerical skills as well as calculation (see Supplementary Material for detailed information about the subtests). Based on this test battery children with DD were identified from scores below the 10th percentile in three subtests or in the total test score (test scores are reported in percentile ranks). At the follow-up assessment, the test for Basic Diagnosis in Mathematics Education for Grades 4–8 (BASIS-MATH 4–8) (Moser Opitz et al.,  ) was used instead, because it is the only German test in existence which can identify numerical deficiencies up to the eighth grade. The BASIS-MATH test battery is composed of three difficulty levels measuring several arithmetical abilities (see also Supplementary Material). The test battery assumes that mastery of basic mathematical concepts is not reached, if the performance falls under a threshold value of 67 points (out of total 83 points, reported test scores are raw values). 

In order to asses children's arithmetic performance at the peer level, the Arithmetic subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) (Tewes et al.,  ) was performed at baseline. In this subtest children had to solve story problems of increasing difficulty within a set time limit (reported test values are IQ scores). At the follow-up measurement, the Quantity Comparison subtest of the Cognitive Abilities Test (KFT 4-12+R) (Heller and Perleth,  ) was performed. In the Quantity Comparison subtest subjects had 10 min time to solve as many quantity comparisons as possible of increasing difficulty (reported test values are T scores). 


#### Number line task 
  
The spatial representation of numbers was measured by means of a paper-and-pencil number line task adopted from Kucian et al. ( ). Children had to estimate the position of 20 Arabic digits on a left to right oriented number line (length 16 cm) with the labeled end points 0 and 100. A single number was presented verbally as well as visually in form of an Arabic digit on a card. Each number had to be marked on consecutive number lines to avoid the possibility of comparisons between items. Two items per decade were chosen in order to evaluate the entire spatial representation between 0 and 100. 

At the follow-up, a computerized and age-adapted version of the number line task was used. Each of the 20 numbers was presented visually on the screen and its position was indicated by mouse-click. The number line was 21.3 cm in length (806 pixel, with a screen resolution 96 dpi) and had labeled end points. For the number range 0–100, two numbers per decade were selected again. Additionally, participants had to solve 20 items in the number range between 0 and 1000. To obtain the items in the range 0–1000, the numbers of the number line test 0–100 were multiplied by 10 and a random digit between 0 and 9 was added in the unit position. 

In both test versions accuracy was measured by calculating the percentage distance from the marked to the correct position of the given number (reported test values are raw values). 


#### Basic arithmetic operations 
  
Children solved 40 basic arithmetic problems (20 addition and 20 subtraction) (Kucian et al.,  ). Each problem was presented verbally as well as visually on a card. The child had to provide the solution verbally and the examiner noted it on the evaluation sheet. There was no time limit for this test. The items ranged from 1 to 100 with single digit as well as double digit problems (e.g., 7+15, 36+42). The items were balanced for frequency of digits and bridging ten. The number of correctly solved items was quantified (reported test values are raw scores, maximum value 20). 

At the follow-up, a computerized and age-adapted version of this task was used. Each of the 20 addition and 20 subtraction was presented visually on the screen and solutions were typed on a keyboard. There was no time limit for this test. To prevent ceiling effects, the test was expanded to numbers up to 1000. Items consisted of one-, two- and three-digit numbers (e.g., 811+5, 235+324) and were balanced for frequency of digits and bridging ten/hundred. RT was measured and the number of correctly solved items was quantified (reported test values are raw scores, maximum value 20). 


#### Intelligence quotient 
  
Intelligence was measured with the third, respectively fourth edition of the WISC (Tewes et al.,  ; Petermann and Petermann,  ) (WISC-III: Similarities, Block Design, Vocabulary, Picture Arrangement; WISC-IV: Similarities, Block Design, Matrix Reasoning). Table   shows the estimated general IQ (reported test values are IQ scores).

#### Working memory 
  
Visuo-spatial and verbal working memory was assessed in order to control for memory effects. At baseline and follow-up working memory was measured with the Block-Suppression-Test (Beblo et al.,  ). The task required subjects to reproduce every second block of a previous presented sequence on a board with nine cubes. The sequences had a length of 3–9 cubes. Three items per sequence were presented. The longest sequence which was reproduced correctly twice was quantified (reported test values are raw scores, maximum value 9). 

At the follow-up the subtest Digit Span of the WISC-IV (Petermann and Petermann,  ) was additionally performed. In this task subjects had to repeat an auditorily presented sequence of numerals backwards. The sequences had a length of 2 to 8 numerals. The longest sequence which was reproduced correctly was quantified (reported test values are raw scores, maximum value 8). 


#### Attention 
  
Levels of attention and inhibition were measured at follow-up by means of the subtests Alertness and Go-Nogo of the computerized Testbattery for Attentional Performance (TAP) (Zimmermann and Fimm,  ). In the Alertness subtest, subjects had to react as quickly as possible when the target stimulus “X” appeared (intrinsic alertness). Half of the trials were preceded by an acoustic cue stimulus (phasic alertness). The test has four runs and a total of 80 target items. For each subject the percentile rank of the median RT was quantified (reported test values are percentile ranks). In the Go-Nogo subtest, subjects had to react as quickly as possible to a target stimulus (“X,” go condition), but inhibit reactions on a second presented stimulus (“+,” nogo condition). The test has a total of 40 items (20 go and 20 nogo items). For each subject the percentile rank of the median RT was quantified (reported test values are percentile ranks). 


#### Reading 
  
The 1-Min-Reading-Task from the Salzburg Reading and Orthography Test (SLRT-II) (Moll and Landerl,  ) assessing word and pseudoword reading fluency was used to estimate the reading performance at follow-up. Two sheets of paper with either 156 words or 156 pseudowords of increasing length and difficulty were presented. Subjects had 1 min per sheet to read as many words as possible. The amount of correctly read items was quantified (reported test values are percentile ranks). Because of lacking test norms in grades 7 and 8, we interpolated the norms from the test manual (grade 6) and from Kronschnabel et al. ( ) (grade 9). 



### fMRI task 
  
The fMRI task, adopted from Kucian et al. ( ), was identical between the baseline and follow-up measurements. In the experimental condition, subjects had to make ordinal judgements (numerical order task: “Are the numbers in an ascending/descending order?”). The control condition was a number identification task (“Is the number 2 present?”) (Figure  ). The entire paradigm lasted 10.5 min and consisted of four blocks of the numerical order task alternating with four blocks of the number identification task. Blocks were counter-balanced between subjects. At the beginning of each block an instruction was shown for 2 s, followed by 10 trials of one of the two conditions and a rest period with a fixation cross for 20 s, resulting in a total block length of 59.5 s. Every stimulus was presented for 2 s, followed by a blank screen with an inter-stimulus-interval jittered between 3 and 5 s. 
  
fMRI task. The paradigm consisted of alternating blocks of the experimental and control condition. In the experimental condition, subjects had to decide if the three presented numbers were in ascending or descending order (numerical order task). For instance, subjects had to press “yes” in the first and last trial shown in the picture and “no” for the second one. In the control condition, subjects had to indicate if the number 2 was present. Every stimulus was presented for 2 s, followed by a screen with a fixation cross ( ) shown for 3–5 s. Reprinted from Kucian et al. ( ), copyright (2011) with permission from Elsevier. 
  
A stimulus consisted of three Arabic digits between “2” and “9” (horizontally aligned) shown simultaneously via a video goggles system (VisuaStimDigital, Resonance Technology Inc., USA). 40 numerical order items were presented, one fourth with ascending (correct), one fourth with descending (correct) and half of them with no specific order (incorrect). The order of the numerals in the ascending condition (e.g., 2 5 7) was reversed to obtain the descending items (e.g., 7 5 2) and mixed up to obtain the items with no specific order (e.g., 5 2 7). In the control condition, 40 number identification items were presented (20 correct and 20 incorrect items). The paradigm was balanced for numerical distance [max(  n  )-min(  n  ): 5, 6, or 7] between the correct and incorrect as well as ascending and descending items, respectively. Children responded by a button press of the dominant hand (index finger for “yes,” middle finger for “no”). The paradigm was programmed on E-Prime (Version 2, Psychology Software Tolls Inc., USA) and answers were recorded by an MRI compatible response box (Lumina Respond Pad, Cedrus Corporation, USA). Reaction times (RT) smaller than 300 ms and misses were not included in the analyses of the paradigm. 


### Image acquisition 
  
MRI data were acquired on a 3T General Electric Signa Scanner (GE Medical Systems, USA) using an 8-channel head coil. Whole brain functional images were acquired interleaved with a gradient echo EPI sequence [36 slices, slice thickness (ST) = 3.4 mm, no interslice skip, matrix size (MS) = 64 × 64, field of view (FOV) = 220 × 220 mm, in-plane resolution = 3.4 × 3.4 mm, flip angle (FA) = 45°, echo time (TE) = 31 ms, repetition time (TR) = 2100 ms]. Additionally, a T1-weighted structural image was obtained with a fast spoiled gradient echo sequence (3D FSPGR, ST = 1 mm, no interslice skip, MS = 256 × 192, FOV = 240 × 192 mm, FA = 20°, TE = 2912 ms, TR = 9972 ms). 

Participants were carefully instructed and supplied with hearing protection before entering the scanner. To minimize head motion, the head was stabilized with padding. 


### Data analysis 
  
#### Behavioral data 
  
Behavioral data was statistically analyzed with SPSS (Version 20). To assess group differences parametric   t  -tests for independent samples or, if data deviated from normal distribution, non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z-test were performed. In the cases were the assumption of homogeneity of variance was violated, we adjusted the degrees of freedom using the Welch-Satterthwaite method. A mixed-model ANOVA with time (baseline/follow-up) as within-subject factor and group (DD/TD) as between-subject factor was conducted to examine developmental effects. Effect sizes are reported as Cohen's d for   t  -tests and partial η  for the mixed-model ANOVA. As suggested by Cohen ( ) effect sizes are interpreted as small (  d   = 0.2, η  = 0.01), medium (  d   = 0.5, η  = 0.06) or large (  d   = 0.8, η  = 0.14). 


#### fMRI data 
  
##### fMRI motion 
  
For each subject the motion finger print according to Wilke ( ) was calculated. Total displacement, a vector combining the measures of translation (x, y, and z) and rotation (pitch, roll, and yaw), was used to check if there is a difference in motion between the baseline and the follow-up measurement and TD and DD group, respectively. In more detail, the motion fingerprint provides a total displacement value and a scan-to-scan displacement value for each volume. For each subject the mean total displacement (td) and mean scan-to-scan displacement (sts) over the time series were calculated (values are reported in mm). 

Groups did not differ at the baseline in td (DD: 0.34-2.10, Median = 0.66, TD: 0.43–2.34, Median = 0.98, Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z = 1.02,   p   = 0.17, two-sided) or sts (DD: 0.06–0.41, Median = 0.14, TD: 0.07–0.73, Median = 0.13, Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z = 0.48,   p   = 0.83, two-sided). Also at follow-up, we did not find any differences between the groups for td (DD: 0.44–1.13, Median = 0.70, TD: 0.31–1.28, Median = 0.90, Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z = 0.81,   p   = 0.40, two-sided) and sts (DD: 0.05–0.19, Median = 0.06, TD: 0.05–0.10, Median = 0.06, Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z = 0.26,   p   = 0.95, two-sided). 

Between the baseline (0.34–2.34, Median = 0.91) and follow-up (0.31–1.28, Median = 0.75) no difference was found for td (Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test,   z   = −1.39,   p   = 0.17, two-sided). However, the sts displacement was significantly higher for the baseline (0.06–0.73, Median = 0.13) compared to the follow-up measurement (0.05–0.19, Median = 0.06, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test,   z   = −3.53,   p   < 0.001, two-sided). Therefore, it is unlikely that motion affects the results of the group comparison, but it might impact the statistical power of the developmental comparison of the present study. 


##### fMRI preprocessing 
  
The data were analyzed by means of Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Trust Centre for NeuroImaging, UK) running under Matlab (Release 2012b, The MathWorks Inc., USA). 

Three dummy scans, acquired to stabilize magnetization at the beginning of the scan, were excluded from the analysis. Then the subjects' functional scans were realigned with rigid body transformations using the mean image as a reference scan. Six motion parameters (translation in x, y, and z direction as well as rotation in pitch, roll and yaw) were stored and included later in the analysis to control for motion. The mean functional image was then coregistered to the subjects' T1-weighted anatomical scan. In a next step, the individual anatomical scan was segmented into gray and white matter according to tissue probability maps of a pediatric atlas (NIH Paediatric Database) (Fonov et al.,  ,  ). The parameters from the coregistration and segmentation were applied to the functional scans to normalize images into MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space. Finally, the functional images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm FWHM (full width half maximum). 


##### fMRI statistics 
  
The first level analysis was performed using a mass-univariate approach based on the GLM. The time series from each subject were modeled with an event related design for the experimental and control condition using a canonical HRF (hemodynamic response function). The subjects' motion parameters were entered as additional regressors. Slow signal drifts and serial correlations were accounted for by using a high-pass filter of 180 s and a first level autoregressive model during maximum-likelihood estimation of the GLM parameters. 

At the group level, a full factorial analysis with the factors group and time as well as IQ as a covariate was conducted for the contrast experimental-control condition. For the factor time (repeated measurement), within-subjects correlations were accounted for by estimating the covariance and accordingly adjusting the statistics and degrees of freedom during inference. 

Statistical results are shown at   p   < 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster-extent threshold of   k   ≥ 19 voxels (513 mm ) or at   p   < 0.005 and   k   ≥ 22 (594 mm ). According to Slotnick ( ), the spatial autocorrelation of the data was estimated. Then a Monte Carlo simulation was run with 10'000 iterations, using a type I error voxel activation probability of 0.001, and an estimated FWHM as a Gaussian smoothing kernel in order to derive the cluster extent threshold yielding the desired correction for multiple comparisons at a   p   < 0.05 level (Slotnick,  ). 

Anatomical localization of the fMRI results was attained through the SPM Anatomy Toolbox (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ) and is reported in MNI coordinates. 





## Results 
  
### Behavioral data 
  
Groups did not differ in terms of age, gender and handedness (Table  ). 

#### Diagnosis of DD and general numerical abilities 
  
Numerical abilities differed significantly between DD and TD children at baseline [ZAREKI-R   t   = −12.12,   p   < 0.001,   d   = −4.08] and follow-up [BASIS-MATH 4–8   t   = −7.80,   p   < 0.001,   d   = −3.06; Table  ]. Every child in the DD group scored under the threshold value of 67 points in the BASIS-MATH and therefore still fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for DD at the follow-up. Moreover, the BASIS-MATH data revealed that the DD group differed significantly in all difficulty levels of the test (all   p   < 0.001), showing a substantial deficit in the very basic arithmetical skills at a mean age of 14 years. 

Not surprisingly, at both time points DD children also performed significantly worse than the TD group in the tests measuring numerical skills at a peer level [Arithmetic subtest of the WISC-III at baseline:   t   = −3.34,   p   = 0.004,   d   = −1.68; Quantity Comparison subtest of the KFT 4–12+R at follow-up:   t   = −6.90,   p   < 0.001,   d   = −2.94; Table  ]. 


#### Number line task 
  
The number line task 0–100 differed slightly between baseline and follow-up assessment, which is why the following results must be interpreted carefully (see also Materials and Methods section). A mixed-design ANOVA with time as within-subject factor and group as between-subject factor showed a significant effect of group [  F   = 13.02,   p   = 0.002, η  = 0.434] for the number line 0–100 (Table  ). Children with DD placed the numbers further away from the correct position compared to the TD group. There was also a significant main effect of time [  F   = 26.42,   p   < 0.001, η  = 0.609], showing that accuracy increased with development. Finally, the significant interaction time by group indicated that DD children improved more over time than TD children [  F   = 5.44,   p   = 0.032, η  = 0.243]. The number line test 0–1000, performed at the follow-up assessment, also revealed lower performance for the DD than the TD group (Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z   z   = 1.51,   p   = 0.011,   d   = 1.21) (Table  ). Regarding the measured RT at the follow-up assessment, no significant differences could be found in the number line tasks between groups [number line 1–100:   t   = −1.15,   p   > 0.05,   d   = −0.45; number line 1–1000:   t   = −0.97,   p   > 0.05,   d   = −0.38]. 
  
Behavioral results for the spatial representation of numbers (number line), basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction), and the fMRI paradigm. 
    

#### Basic arithmetic operations 
  
For the basic arithmetic operations,   t  -test revealed significant differences between DD and TD children. At baseline and follow-up, TD children solved more addition [baseline:   t   = −3.43,   p   = 0.008,   d   = −2.33; follow-up:   t   = −2.30,   p   = 0.030,   d   = 0.90] and subtraction problems correctly [baseline: Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z   z   = 1.72,   p   = 0.001,   d   = 1.96, follow-up:   t   = −3.79,   p   = 0.001,   d   = −1.53; Table  ]. The measured RTs at follow-up show that children with DD took longer to solve the addition [  t   = 2.20,   p   = 0.041,   d   = 0.91] and the subtraction problems [  t   = 2.42,   p   = 0.023,   d   = 0.97] compared to their peers (Table  ). 


#### Intelligence quotient 
  
All participants reached normal range of intelligence during both assessments (IQ range baseline: 93–125; follow-up: 92–122). However, groups differed significantly in the estimated general IQ [baseline: WISC-III   t   = −4.65,   p   < 0.001,   d   = −1.82; follow-up: WISC-IV   t   = −4.41,   p   < 0.001,   d   = −1.73; Table  ]. Differences in IQ scores between a group of children with learning disabilities and a control group are often reported in the literature (Geary et al.,  ; Willcutt et al.,  ). One reason for this is that IQ-tests are not independent from numerical skills. The IQ was not entered as a covariate in the subsequent behavioral analysis, since IQ is not independent from the effects of interest (Miller and Chapman,  ; Dennis et al.,  ; Field,  ). 


#### Attention, reading and working memory 
  
To match the groups for comorbid attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD) and dyslexia, the TAP and the SLRT-II were performed. Groups did not differ significantly in any measurement of attention or reading performance (Table  ). Regarding working memory, subjects showed at baseline and follow-up comparable results in the verbal and visuo-spatial memory component. The only significant difference was found in visuo-spatial working memory at the follow-up assessment due to lower performance of children with DD compared to TD (Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z   z   = 1.16,   p   = 0.039,   d   = −0.76) (Table  ). 


#### Behavioral results from fMRI task 
  
A mixed-design ANOVA with time as within-subject factor and group as between-subject factor was calculated. For accuracy, the ANOVA revealed a significant effect of time [  F   = 40.85,   p   < 0.001, η  = 0.63], showing that children were better able to solve the task with increasing age (Table  ). Furthermore, the DD group performed significantly worse than the TD group [  F   = 4.30,   p   = 0.049, η  = 0.152]. This significant difference arises from their lower performance in the number order task [  F   = 4.54,   p   = 0.044, η  = 0.159], as performance in the control task was comparable between groups [  F   = 1.66,   p   = 0.209, η  = 0.065]. The group by time interaction was not significant [  F   = 1.95,   p   = 0.176, η  = 0.075]. For RT, no effects of group [  F   = 1.91,   p   > 0.05, η  = 0.074] or interaction between time and group [  F   = 0.43,   p   > 0.05, η  = 0.018] was evident. However, children solved the task faster at the second assessment point [  F   = 50.45,   p   < 0.001, η  = 0.678; Table  ]. 



### fMRI results 
  
Analysis of the task (experimental minus control condition) revealed bilateral parietal activation in TD children at baseline and follow-up. DD children showed at baseline only right lateralized activation in parietal regions (Figure  , Tables  ,  ).

#### fMRI group differences 
  
At baseline, no significant difference between groups was found at the statistical threshold of   p   < 0.001. 

At follow-up, two-sample   t  -tests revealed significant differences between children with DD and controls (Figure  , Table  ). Children with DD showed increased activation in frontal areas including bilateral middle frontal gyri (MFG) and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). In the parietal lobe, more activation in the bilateral angular gyri (AG), extending into the supramarginal gyri (SMG) and the left IPS was found. TD children did not show any increased activation compared to children with DD at follow-up (  p   < 0.001).

(C)   Negative interaction. Activation increase over time was more pronounced in children with dyscalculia compared to typically developing children (group by time interaction,   p   < 0.005,   k   ≥ 22, cluster-extent corrected).

#### fMRI developmental effects 
  
Developmental changes took place in the DD group, showing increased activation in the basal forebrain and the left insula at   p   < 0.001. At a threshold of   p   < 0.005, additional activation increases in the bilateral IPS, right insula, left IFG, left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and left thalamus were observed (Figure  , Table  ). No decrease in activation was found in the DD group over development.

TD children did not show any increase or decrease in activation over development at the statistical threshold of   p   < 0.005. 

The negative interaction time by group indicated that the activation increase over time was more pronounced in children with DD than in TD children. The left IFG was the only region showing interaction effects at the higher cluster-extent threshold (  p   < 0.001). A lower threshold (  p   < 0.005) revealed activation in similar regions to the   t  -test in DD over development, namely in the left middle cingulum extending into somatosensory area, left IPS, left hippocampus, and right AG (Figure  , Table  ). 

In order to investigate the developmental effects further, a regression analysis was performed with 14 fMRI data sets, comprised of both baseline and follow-up scans. Each subjects' activation increase over time, for the contrast experimental minus control condition (interaction time point x condition), and the number of the correctly solved basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) at baseline were included in the analysis. Results revealed a negative correlation between the activation increase over time and the number of correctly solved subtractions and additions at the baseline assessment (cluster-extent corrected   p   < 0.001). This indicates that children who solved fewer arithmetic problems correctly at baseline showed more activation increase over time in bilateral cingulate cortex extending into right frontal gyri and left supplementary motor area (SMA), bilateral insular lobe extending bilaterally into putamen and caudate nucleus, left inferior (IFG) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right cerebellum. In the parietal lobe, broad activation increases were found in bilateral angular gyri (AG) extending into inferior parietal lobe and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and bilateral precuneus (see Figure  ). 




## Discussion 
  
In the present longitudinal study, we investigated the neuro-functional development of children with and without DD by means of neuropsychological tests and fMRI. In line with previous studies, we found that children with DD improved over time, but nonetheless showed persistent deficits in number processing and arithmetical skills when compared to their peers. 

Brain imaging results revealed an increase in frontal and parietal brain activation over time in children with DD. In contrast, results of TD children point to a stable activation pattern over development. Furthermore, a lower performance in basic arithmetic operations correlates with a more pronounced increase in the fronto-parietal network over time. 

### Deficient numerical processing and aberrant neural networks 
  
As hypothesized, we found considerable deficits in number processing and arithmetic abilities in children with DD compared to a peer group. The more pronounced inaccuracy in a number line task is typically found in dyscalculics and is consistent with a large body of research findings (Geary et al.,  ,  ; Landerl,  ). In addition, the accuracy in a number line task is thought to reflect a better representation of quantity (Siegler and Booth,  ; Ebersbach et al.,  ). Therefore, our data point to a deficient mental number line representation in 9 and 14-year old dyscalculic children. Consistent with the study from Piazza et al. ( ), the children with DD performed at the same level as the control group when 4-years younger. Given that numerical magnitude representation further influences arithmetical learning, it is in good agreement with earlier studies (Booth and Siegler,  ) that our DD group also showed poor performance in basic addition and subtraction problems. 

Regarding brain activation, group differences were evident at the follow-up assessment. Children with DD showed increased activation in frontal (MFG, IFG) and parietal (AG, left IPS) regions of the numerical network compared to their peers. This is in contradiction with studies reporting reduced activation in the parietal key regions for numeracy. However, our findings are in line with several studies, who found increased activation in fronto-parietal regions of DD children (Kaufmann et al.,  ; Kucian et al.,  ; Iuculano et al.,  ; Rosenberg-Lee et al.,  ). Similar results were further reported in the meta-analysis by Kaufmann et al. ( ). The authors suggested, that the increased IPS and postcentral activation reflects the recruitment of finger-based number representation in DD children, which might also be the case in our study. 

At baseline, we did not find any differences in the activation pattern of the groups. A reason for this is that we chose a rather strict significance level to report our results. When lowering the statistical threshold activation differences in occipito-parietal, temporal and frontal regions could be detected, which are in line with those reported in the literature (e.g., Kaufmann et al.,  ; Kucian et al.,  ). 


### Typical and atypical development 
  
Consistent with our expectations, TD children showed a growing proficiency in number processing with development, as seen in a significant improvement in the number line task. DD children also did not stagnate in their development, exhibiting a decrease in error rates when placing numbers on a number line. In fact, our results showed that the dyscalculic's number line performance improved more over time than that of the TD children. This result is consistent with other findings of long-term studies (Geary et al.,  ; Landerl,  ). However, even when the gap between the typical and atypical development in the mental number line decreases, children with DD always performed significantly lower than their peers. Our results confirm findings from earlier studies (Shalev et al.,  ,  ) and the result from a systematic review (Nelson and Powell,  ) showing that number representation in DD is deficient and delayed in development. In addition, children with DD still showed substantial deficits in simple arithmetic through the entire study. This result supports the importance of effective and efficient ordinal and magnitude number processing abilities in the development of arithmetical skills (Booth and Siegler,  ). 

The brain activation patterns of TD children revealed no significant difference over the examined time. This result seems surprising, considering findings from earlier studies, who showed an age related activation increase in the IPS and a decrease in frontal areas during magnitude processing (Ansari et al.,  ; Ansari and Dhital,  ). However, it is important to note that most of the studies compare numeracy-established adults with developing children and therefore assume linearity in development. It might be that some of the mentioned changes occur only at specific periods in development. Moreover, the brain activation pattern from our results is in line with results from a study using the same task (Kucian et al.,  ). Our findings are further consistent with Kucian et al. ( ), revealing no differences comparing children over a 3-year period, but finding changes between children and adults. Along with the increasing proficiency on the behavioral level, our results speak for a consistent and well working number processing network in TD children. Importantly, the present results do not exclude the possibility that the number processing network continuously develops and refines in typical development over time. Furthermore, these results must be interpreted cautiously and confirmed with bigger group sizes. 

Interestingly, children with DD showed a remarkable activation increase in the entire fronto-parietal network over the observed period of development. The growth of activation in the basal forebrain, bilateral insula and bilateral IFG is in good agreement with the literature, indicating that these regions play a crucial role in working memory, attention, and cognitive control. Together with the better performance in the fMRI task, this finding supports the notion that children with DD constantly use domain-general regions to a larger extent, reflecting the higher cognitive demands induced by the task. Besides, children with DD showed an activation increase in the bilateral IPS over developmental time. It is further worth pointing out, that in children with DD the activation increase in the left IPS was much greater than in the right IPS, whilst TD peers showed stable bilateral IPS activation over time. Findings show that activation changes with growing proficiency in (symbolic) number representation in the left IPS and is stable over development in the right IPS (Vogel et al.,  ). In context with the improvement in the fMRI paradigm and the catch-up in the number line task, our results lend support to a stronger use of number-specific areas in children with DD. This is in line with the results of the regression analysis, indicating that children who solved fewer arithmetic problems correctly at baseline showed more activation increase over time. Furthermore, the negative interaction also revealed activation in parietal number-specific regions and frontal domain-general regions, indicating that the developmental changes were more pronounced in children with DD. This mirrors the results from our behavioral data and previous studies, showing that the gap between TD and DD performance diminishes over development (Geary et al.,  ; Landerl,  ). 

To our knowledge, no neuro-imaging long-term studies exist in the field of dyscalculia, but results from studies with dyslexic children also showed differences in the development of the neural reading system. Comparable to our findings, age related increases are seen in domain-specific occipito-temporal regions but also in domain-general regions (left IFG) (Shaywitz et al.,  ). Furthermore, Rosenberg-Lee et al. ( ) looked at brain maturation processes between 2nd and 3rd grades during arithmetic problem solving. In line with our results, better behavioral performance and a significant increase in activity were observed in the right superior parietal lobe, IPS and AG, PHG, and frontal regions from grade 2 to 3. Based on these activation increases, which have been associated with initial stages of learning, the developmental effects in our DD group might also reflect neural maturation processes. 

To summarize, our results support the notion that TD children have a well-functioning number processing network, and therefore showed only subtle developmental effects over the examined time. Dyscalculic children, however, showed age-related changes in frontal areas of the brain. These can be related to compensatory mechanisms or different but less effective task solving strategies, which are often observed in children with DD. Secondly, the increase in domain-specific parietal areas, hints to maturation or delayed development of number processing areas. Although these findings are promising, it is important to note that children with DD did not fully catch up to their peer group in numerical-arithmetical skills and showed less focused activation patterns, underscoring that the deficiencies do not fully vanish with time. 


### Methodological considerations 
  
To our knowledge this is the first longitudinal study looking at neural development in children with and without DD. The lack of other longitudinal studies in DD might arise from several reasons. Firstly, longitudinal fMRI studies in children are especially prone to high drop-out due to more movement artifacts and braces. This was also the case in our study and the reason why we have unequal and small sample sizes. For this reason, our results (in particular the results from the TD children) should be interpreted with caution. However, the same main results were obtained when evaluating the study with equal group sizes revealing that our results are stable and not based on differences in group size (see Supplementary Material and Figures  – ). Furthermore, in order to check the statistical power of our findings, we conducted   post-hoc   power analyses (G Power; Faul et al.,  ) for the significant main results of the behavioral data with α = 0.05, and the effect and sample sizes as reported for the specific statistical test (see Results section, Tables  ,  ). For most of the tests we reached good statistical power (1−β ≥ 0.80). However, for the interaction of the number line test 1–100 and the effect of group in the accuracy of the fMRI paradigm we detected a power of 0.60 and 0.51, respectively. Thus, the likelihood that these results reflect true effects is reduced. In addition, power analyses for the main effects of the fMRI data were conducted by means of the software package fMRIpower (Mumford and Nichols,  ). This method estimates power for detecting significant activation within specific regions of interest, with the assumption that the planned studies will have the same number of runs per subject, runs of the same length, similar scanner noise characteristics, and data analysis with a comparable model (Mumford and Nichols,  ). For this purpose, post-training data from Kucian et al. ( ) (which were acquired with the same fMRI paradigm on the same MR-Scanner, but were not included in the present longitudinal study, see also Materials and Methods section) were used as “pilot data” for the power analysis. The power analyses were carried out for each of the regions of the automated anatomical labeling (aai) roi mask with α = 0.05 and the sample sizes as reported for the specific contrast of the present study. For the   group differences at the follow-up assessment   (Figure  , Table  ), power estimates between 11 and 62% were obtained for the brain areas that showed significant activation, with the highest power estimate of 62% observed in the left IPS and angular gyrus. Similarly, the brain areas that showed significant   developmental changes in children with DD   (Figure  , Table  ), reached power estimates between 18 and 79%. The highest values of 70 and 79% of power were detected for the left and the right IPS, respectively, whilst lower power estimates were reached for the frontal areas of the brain. Despite the fact that more subjects would be necessary to increase the power of the present study, the results of the conducted power analyses reveal that the power estimates for the numerical key areas are already near to the desired power of 80% and therefore likely show true effects. 

Secondly, the choice of the fMRI paradigm, especially in longitudinal studies, is constrained by the requirements that it must be feasible for children with DD (performance over chance level) and not too easy for TD children (ceiling effects). An adaptation of the difficulty level of the task results in a loss of comparability over time, which we wanted to avoid. As a consequence, ceiling effects might have led to a loss of behavioral group differences at the follow-up. 

Thirdly, longitudinal study designs are very time consuming regarding (re-)recruitment and maintenance of the participant's motivation. Thus, developmental questions are in many cases examined by more time-efficient methods such as cross-sectional designs. Importantly, cross-sectional designs do not take into account inter-individual differences to the same extent as longitudinal designs. Furthermore, most cross sectional-studies compare adults and children and might therefore miss an opportunity to capture the full developmental trajectory. We think that our results are promising and provide an important contribution to the understanding of the typical and atypical development of number processing, but further work is needed to verify our findings and strengthen the understanding of developmental trajectories. 

Despite these methodological considerations, our findings suggest a continuation in the neural development of number representation in children with DD, whereas the neural network for simple ordinal number estimation seems to be stable or show only subtle changes over time in TD children. Furthermore, our results shed light on the behavioral and neural trajectories in dyscalculia and emphasize the importance of longitudinal studies for the understanding of development. This knowledge contributes to the understanding of numeracy and might therefore be meaningful for education and implementation of therapy and support of children with difficulties in mathematics.

# Abstract
 
A significant body of research in cognitive neuroscience is aimed at understanding how object concepts are represented in the human brain. However, it remains unknown whether and where the visual and abstract conceptual features that define an object concept are integrated. We addressed this issue by comparing the neural pattern similarities among object-evoked fMRI responses with behavior-based models that independently captured the visual and conceptual similarities among these stimuli. Our results revealed evidence for distinctive coding of visual features in lateral occipital cortex, and conceptual features in the temporal pole and parahippocampal cortex. By contrast, we found evidence for integrative coding of visual and conceptual object features in perirhinal cortex. The neuroanatomical specificity of this effect was highlighted by results from a searchlight analysis. Taken together, our findings suggest that perirhinal cortex uniquely supports the representation of fully specified object concepts through the integration of their visual and conceptual features.

Our ability to interact with the world depends in large part on our understanding of objects. But objects that look similar, such as a hairdryer and a gun, may do different things, while objects that look different, such as tape and glue, may have similar roles. The fact that we can effortlessly distinguish between such objects suggests that the brain combines information about an object’s visual and abstract properties. 

Nevertheless, brain imaging experiments show that thinking about what an object looks like activates different brain regions to thinking about abstract knowledge. For example, thinking about an object’s appearance activates areas that support vision, whereas thinking about how to use that object activates regions that control movement. So how does the brain combine these different kinds of information? 

Martin et al. asked healthy volunteers to answer questions about objects while lying inside a brain scanner. Questions about appearance (such as “is a hairdryer angular?”) activated different regions of the brain to questions about abstract knowledge (“is a hairdryer manmade?”). But both types of question also activated a region of the brain called the perirhinal cortex. When volunteers responded to either type of question, the activity in their perirhinal cortex signaled both the physical appearance of the object as well as its abstract properties, even though both types of information were not necessary for the task. This suggests that information in the perirhinal cortex reflects combinations of multiple features of objects. 

These findings provide insights into a neurodegenerative disorder called semantic dementia. Patients with semantic dementia lose their general knowledge about the world. This leads to difficulties interacting with everyday objects. Patients may try to use a fork to comb their hair, for example. Notably, the perirhinal cortex is a brain region that is usually damaged in semantic dementia. Loss of combined information about the visual and abstract properties of objects may lie at the core of the observed impairments.

## Introduction 
  
Semantic memory imbues the world with meaning and shapes our understanding of the relationships among object concepts. Many neurocognitive models of semantic memory incorporate the notion that object concepts are represented in a feature-based manner ( ;  ;  ). On this view, our understanding of the concept ‘hairdryer’ is thought to reflect knowledge of observable perceptual properties (e.g. visual form) and abstract conceptual features (e.g. ‘  used to style hair  ’). Importantly, there is not always a one-to-one correspondence between how something looks and what it is; a hairdryer and a comb are conceptually similar despite being visually distinct, whereas a hairdryer and a gun are conceptually distinct despite being visually similar. Thus, a fully-specified representation of an object concept (i.e. one that can be distinguished from any and all other concepts), requires integration of its perceptual and conceptual features. 

Neuroimaging research suggests that object features are coded in the modality-specific cortical regions that supported their processing at the time of acquisition ( ). For example, knowledge about the visual form of an object concept is thought to be coded in occipito-temporal visual processing regions ( ). However, neurocognitive models of semantic memory differ with respect to how distributed feature representations relate to fully specified object concepts. On one view, these representations are thought to emerge through interactions among modality-specific cortical areas ( ;  ). Within a competing class of theories, they are thought to reflect the integration of modality-specific features in trans-modal convergence zones ( ;  ;  ), such as the anterior temporal lobes (ATL) ( ;  ;  ). 

The dominant view of the ATL as a semantic hub was initially shaped by neuropsychological investigations in individuals with semantic dementia (SD) ( ). Behaviorally, SD is characterized by the progressive loss of conceptual knowledge across all receptive and expressive modalities ( ;  ). At the level of neuropathology, SD is associated with extensive atrophy of the ATL, with the earliest and most pronounced volume loss in the left temporal pole ( ;  ). Most important from a theoretical perspective, patients with SD tend to confuse conceptually similar objects that are visually distinct (e.g. hairdryer – comb), but not visually similar objects that are conceptually distinct (e.g., hairdryer – gun), indicating that the temporal pole expresses conceptual similarity structure ( ; see  ;  , for related neuroimaging evidence). Taken together, these findings suggest that the temporal pole supports multi-modal integration of abstract conceptual, but not perceptual, features. Notably, however, a considerable body of research indicates that the temporal pole may not be the only ATL structure that supports feature-based integration. 

The representational-hierarchical model of object coding emphasizes a role for perirhinal cortex (PRC), located in the medial ATL, in feature integration that is distinct from that of the temporal pole ( ). Namely, within this framework PRC is thought to support the integration of conceptual   and   perceptual features. In line with this view, object representations in PRC have been described in terms of conceptual feature conjunctions in studies of semantic memory ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), and visual feature conjunctions in studies of visual processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, it is difficult to synthesize results from these parallel lines of research, in part, because conceptual and perceptual features tend to vary concomitantly across stimuli ( ). For example, demonstrating that ‘horse’ and ‘donkey’ are represented with greater neural pattern similarity in PRC than are ‘horse’ and ‘dolphin’ may reflect differences in conceptual or perceptual relatedness. Thus, although the representational-hierarchical account was initially formalized nearly two decades ago ( ), direct evidence of integration across conceptual and perceptual features remains elusive. 

In the current study, we used fMRI to identify where in the brain visual and conceptual object features are stored, and to determine whether and where they are integrated at the level of fully specified object representations. To this end, we first generated behavior-based models that captured the visual and conceptual similarities among a set of object concepts, ensuring that these dimensions were not confounded across stimuli ( ). Next, participants were scanned using task contexts that biased attention to either the conceptual or visual features of these well-characterized object concepts ( ). We then used representational similarity analysis (RSA) ( ), implemented using ROI- and searchlight-based approaches, to determine where the brain-based similarity structure among object-evoked multi-voxel activity patterns could be predicted by the similarity structure in the behavior-based visual and conceptual similarity models.

We predicted that lateral occipital cortex (LOC), an occipito-temporal region that has been implicated in the processing of visual form ( ;  ;  ), would represent stored visual object features in a visual similarity code. Based on the neurocognitive models of semantic memory reviewed, we predicted that the temporal pole would represent stored conceptual object features in a conceptual similarity code ( ;  ). We also predicted conceptual similarity coding in parahippocampal cortex, which has been linked to the representation of the contextually-based co-occurrence of objects ( ;  ). Critically, objects that are regularly encountered in the same context (e.g. ‘comb’ and ‘hairdryer’ in a barbershop) often share many conceptual features (e.g. ‘  used to style hair  ’). Thus, to the extent that shared conceptual features directly shape contextual meaning, object-evoked responses in parahippocampal cortex may express conceptual similarity structure. Returning to the primary objective of the study, we predicted that PRC would uniquely represent the visual and conceptual features that define fully-specified object concepts in an integrated similarity code. 


## Results 
  
### Behavior-based similarity models 
  
Using a data-driven approach, we first generated behavior-based models that captured the visual and conceptual similarities among 40 targeted object concepts ( ). Notably, our visual similarity model and conceptual similarity model were derived from behavioral judgments provided by two independent groups of participants. For the purpose of constructing the visual similarity model, the first group of participants (N = 1185) provided pairwise comparative similarity judgments between object concepts ( ). Specifically, a pair of words was presented on each trial and participants were asked to rate the visual similarity between the object concepts to which they referred using a 5-point Likert scale. Similarity ratings for each pair of object concepts were averaged across participants, normalized, and expressed within a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM). We refer to this RDM as the   behavior-based visual RDM  . 

For the purpose of constructing the conceptual similarity model, a second group of participants (N = 1600) completed an online feature-generation task ( ;  ) ( ). Each participant was asked to generate a list of conceptual features that characterize one object concept (e.g. hairdryer:   ‘used to style hair’, ‘found in salons’, ‘electrically powered’, ‘blows hot air’  ; comb:   ‘used to style hair’, ‘found in salons’, ‘has teeth’, ‘made of plastic’  ). Conceptual similarity between all pairs of object concepts was quantified as the cosine angle between the corresponding pairs of feature vectors. With this approach, high cosine similarity between object concepts reflects high conceptual similarity. Cosine similarity values were then expressed within an RDM, which we refer to as the   behavior-based conceptual RDM  . 

We next performed a second-level RSA to quantify the relationship between our behavior-based visual RDM and behavior-based conceptual RDM. This comparison is denoted by the gray arrow between behavior-based RDMs in  . Critically, this analysis revealed that the model RDMs were not significantly correlated with one another (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.01, p=0.10), indicating that differences in visual and conceptual features were not confounded across object concepts. In other words, ensuring that these different types of features varied independently across stimuli (e.g. hairdryer – gun; hairdryer – comb), rather than concomitantly (e.g. horse – donkey; horse – dolphin), allowed us to isolate the separate influence of visual and conceptual features on the representational structure of object concepts in the brain. In this example, a hairdryer and a gun are visually similar but conceptually dissimilar, whereas a hairdryer and a comb are visually dissimilar but conceptually similar. 


### Comparison of behavior-based RDMs with a corpus-based (word2vec) semantic RDM 
  
We next sought to compare our behavior-based RDMs with a corpus-based model of conceptual similarity. To this end, we implemented a word2vec language model, which mapped 3 million words to 300 feature vectors in a high-dimensional space ( ). The model was trained using ~100 billion words from a Google News dataset. From this model, we calculated the cosine similarity between feature vectors for all pairs of words in our stimulus set. These data were expressed in a 40 × 40 word2vec RDM (  contains the word2vec RDM). Importantly, the word2vec RDM was significantly correlated with our behavior-based conceptual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.11, SE = 0.0141, p<0.00001), suggesting that both models captured the conceptual similarity structure among the object concepts. However, the word2vec RDM was also significantly correlated with our behavior-based visual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.04, SE = 0.0130, p<0.001). This result suggests that, in line with our objectives, the behavior-based conceptual RDM captured semantic similarity selectively defined as conceptual object features, whereas the word2vec RDM may have captured a broader definition of semantic similarity, that is, one that includes both visual semantics and abstract conceptual features. Consistent with this view, gun and hairdryer were conceptually unrelated in our behavior-based conceptual RDM (cosine = 0), whereas the word2vec RDM suggested modest conceptual similarity (cosine = 0.16). Although this difference is likely determined by multiple factors, it is important to note that gun and hairdryer had a relatively high visual similarity index in our behaviour-based visual RDM (normalized mean rating = 0.58). These data highlight a theoretically important distinction between our behaviorally derived conceptual feature-based statistics and corpus-based estimates of semantic similarity. Specifically, the former allow for distinctions between visual and conceptual object features, whereas corpus-based models may not. 


### fMRI task and behavioral results 
  
We used fMRI to estimate the representational structure of our 40 object concepts from neural activity patterns in an independent group of participants ( ). Given our specific interest in understanding pre-existing representations of object concepts rather than bottom-up perceptual processing, all stimuli were presented as words. This approach ensured that conceptual and visual features were extracted from pre-existing representations of object concepts. That is to say, both conceptual and visual features were arbitrarily related to the physical input (i.e. the orthography of the word). By contrast, when pictures are used as stimuli, visual features are accessible from the pictorial cue, whereas conceptual features require abstraction from the cue. Functional brain data were acquired over eight experimental runs, each of which consisted of two blocks of stimulus presentation. All 40 object concepts were presented sequentially within each block, for a total of 16 repetitions per concept. On each trial, participants were asked to make a ‘yes/no’ property verification judgment in relation to a block-specific verification probe. Half of the blocks were associated with verification probes that encouraged processing of visual features (e.g. ‘is the object angular?”), and the other half were associated with verification probes that encouraged processing of conceptual features (e.g. ‘is the object a tool?”). Each run consisted of one visual feature verification block and one conceptual feature verification block, with order counterbalanced across runs. With this experimental design, we were able to characterize neural responses to object concepts across two task contexts: a visual task context ( ) and a conceptual task context ( ). 

Behavioral performance on the scanned property verification task indicated that participants interpreted the object concepts and property verification probes with a high degree of consistency ( ). Specifically, all participants (i.e. 16/16) provided the same yes/no response to the property verification task on 88.4% of all trials. Agreement was highest for the ‘living’ verification probe (96.8%) and lowest for the ‘non-tool’ verification probe (73.2%). Moreover, the proportion of trials on which all participants provided the same response did not differ between the visual feature verification task context (mean = 87.3% collapsed across all eight visual probes) and the conceptual feature verification task context (mean = 89.5% collapsed across all eight conceptual probes) (  z   = 0.19, p=0.85). Response latencies were also comparable across the visual feature verification task context (mean = 1361 ms, SD = 303) and the conceptual feature verification task context (mean = 1376 ms, SD = 315) (  t   (15)=1.00, p=0.33, 95% CI [−49.09, 17.71).

### ROI-based RSA: comparison of behavior-based RDMs with brain-based RDMs 
  
We next quantified pairwise similarities between object-evoked multi-voxel activity patterns using a first-level RSA ( ). For the purpose of conducting ROI-based RSA, we focused on multi-voxel activity patterns obtained in PRC, the temporal pole, parahippocampal cortex, and LOC. ROIs from a representative participant are presented in  . These ROIs were selected a priori based on empirical evidence linking their respective functional characteristics to visual object processing, conceptual object processing, or both. Our primary focus was on PRC, which has been linked to integrative coding of visual object features and conceptual object features across parallel lines of research ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The temporal pole has primarily been linked to processing of conceptual object properties ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Parahippocampal cortex has been implicated in the conceptual processing of contextual associations, including representing the co-occurrence of objects, although its functional contributions remain less well defined than the temporal pole ( ;  ;  ). Lastly, LOC, which is a functionally defined region in occipito-temporal cortex, has been revealed to play a critical role in processing visual form ( ;  ;  ). Because we did not have any a priori predictions regarding hemispheric differences, estimates of neural pattern similarities between object concepts were derived from multi-voxel activity collapsed across ROIs in the left and right hemisphere. 
   ROIs in a representative participant.  
Cortical regions examined in the ROI-based RSAs, including lateral occipital cortex (green), parahippocampal cortex (pink), perirhinal cortex (purple), and the temporal pole (cyan). 
  
Object-specific multi-voxel activity patterns were estimated in each run using general linear models fit to data from the visual and conceptual task contexts, separately. Mean object-specific responses were then calculated for each task context by averaging across runs. Linear correlation distances (Pearson’s r) were calculated between all pairs of object-specific multi-voxel activity patterns within each task context and expressed in participant-specific   brain-based visual task RDMs   and   brain-based conceptual task RDMs  . The brain-based visual task RDMs captured the neural pattern similarities obtained between all object concepts in the visual task context (i.e. while participants made visual feature verification judgments) ( ), and the brain-based conceptual task RDMs captured the neural pattern similarities obtained between all object concepts in the conceptual task context (i.e. while participants made conceptual feature verification judgments) ( ). 

We implemented second-level RSA to compare behavior-based visual and conceptual RDMs with the brain-based visual and conceptual task RDMs (these comparisons are denoted by the solid vertical and diagonal arrows in  ). All RDMs were compared in each ROI using a ranked correlation coefficient (Kendall’s tau-a) as a similarity index ( ). Inferential statistical analyses were performed using a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with participants as a random factor. A Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons (4 ROIs x 2 behavior-based RDMs x 2 brain-based RDMs = 16 comparisons, yielding a critical alpha of. 003). With this approach, we revealed that object concepts are represented in three distinct similarity codes that differed across ROIs: a visual similarity code, a conceptual similarity code, and an integrative code. Results from our ROI-based RSA analyses are shown in   and discussed in turn below.

### Lateral occipital cortex represents object concepts in a task-dependent visual similarity code 
  
Consistent with its well-established role in the processing of visual form, patterns of activity within LOC reflected the visual similarity of the object concepts ( ). Specifically, the brain-based visual task RDMs obtained across participants in LOC were significantly correlated with the behavior-based visual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.045, p<0.002), but not the behavior-based conceptual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = −0.006, p=0.72). In other words, activity patterns in LOC expressed a visual similarity structure when participants were asked to make explicit judgments about the visual features that characterized object concepts (e.g. whether an object is angular in form). By contrast, the brain-based conceptual task RDMs obtained across participants in LOC were not significantly correlated with either the behavior-based visual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.006, p=0.13) or the behavior-based conceptual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.003, p=0.65). That is to say, activity patterns in LOC expressed neither visual nor conceptual similarity structure when participants made judgments that pertained to conceptual object features (e.g. whether an object is naturally occurring). Considered together, these results suggest that LOC represented perceptual information about object concepts in a task-dependent visual similarity code. Specifically, when task demands biased attention toward visual features, signals in LOC generalized across visually related object concepts even when they are conceptually distinct (e.g. hairdryer – gun). 


### Parahippocampal cortex represents object concepts in a task-dependent conceptual similarity code 
  
Patterns of activity obtained in parahippocampal cortex, which has previously been associated with the processing of semantically-based contextual associations ( ;  ), reflected the conceptual similarity of the object concepts ( ). First, the brain-based visual task RDMs obtained across participants in parahippocampal cortex were not significantly correlated with either the behavior-based visual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.005, p=0.26) or the behavior-based conceptual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.009, p=0.26). In other words, activity patterns in parahippocampal cortex expressed neither visual nor conceptual similarity structure when participants made judgments that pertained to conceptual object features (e.g. whether an object is symmetrical). Second, the brain-based conceptual task RDMs obtained across participants in parahippocampal cortex were not significantly related to the behavior-based visual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = −0.008, p=0.55), but they were correlated with the behavior-based conceptual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.046, p<0.002). Thus, activity patterns in parahippocampal cortex expressed a conceptual similarity structure when participants were asked to make explicit judgments about the conceptual features that characterized object concepts (e.g. whether an object is a tool). Put another way, conceptual information was represented in parahippocampal cortex in a task-dependent manner that generalized across conceptually related object concepts even when they were visually distinct (e.g. hairdryer – comb). 


### The temporal pole represents object concepts in a task-invariant conceptual similarity code 
  
In line with theoretical frameworks that have characterized the temporal pole as a semantic hub ( ;  ), patterns of activity within this specific ATL structure reflected the conceptual similarity of the object concepts ( ). Specifically, whereas the brain-based visual task RDMs obtained across participants in the temporal pole were not significantly correlated with the behavior-based visual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.006, p=0.25), they were correlated with the behavior-based conceptual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.035, p<0.001). In other words, activity patterns in the temporal pole expressed a conceptual similarity structure when participants were asked to make explicit judgments about the visual features that characterized object concepts (e.g. whether an object is elongated). Similarly, whereas the brain-based conceptual task RDMs obtained across participants in the temporal pole were not significantly correlated with the behavior-based visual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.0005, p=0.47), they were correlated with the behavior-based conceptual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.05, p<0.0001). Thus, activity patterns in the temporal pole expressed a conceptual similarity structure when participants were asked to make explicit judgments about   either   the visual or conceptual features that characterized object concepts (e.g. whether an object is dark in color, or whether an object is pleasant). In other words, conceptual information was represented in the temporal pole in a task-invariant manner that generalized across conceptually related object concepts even when they were visually distinct (e.g. hairdryer – comb). 


### Perirhinal cortex represents object concepts in a task-invariant similarity code that reflects integration of visual and conceptual features 
  
Results obtained in PRC support the notion that this structure integrates visual and conceptual object features (6C), as first theorized in the representational-hierarchical model of object representation ( ). Namely, we revealed that the brain-based visual task RDMs obtained across participants in PRC were significantly correlated with both the behavior-based visual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.052, p<0.0001), and the behavior-based conceptual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.036, p<0.0003). Similarly, the brain-based conceptual task RDMs obtained across participants were also correlated with both the behavior-based visual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.035, p<0.002), and the behavior-based conceptual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.057, p<0.0001). In other words, activity patterns in PRC expressed both visual and conceptual similarity structure when participants were asked to make explicit judgments about the visual features that characterized object concepts (e.g. whether an object is round) and when participants were asked to make explicit judgments about the conceptual features that characterized object concepts (e.g. whether an object is manufactured). 

Numerically, patterns of activity in PRC showed more similarity to the behavior-based visual RDM than to the behavior-based conceptual RDM in the visual task context, and vice versa in the conceptual task context. Therefore, we performed a 2 [behavior-based RDMs] x 2 [brain-based task RDMs] repeated measures ANOVA to formally test for an interaction between behavior-based model and fMRI task context. For this purpose, all Kendall’s tau-a values were transformed to Pearson’s   r   co-efficients (  r   = sin (½ π tau-a),  ), which were then Fisher-z transformed. The task x model interaction neared, but did not reach, significance (F(1,15) = 3.48, p=0.082). 

In sum, these findings indicate that PRC simultaneously expressed both conceptual and visual similarity structure, and did so regardless of whether participants were asked to make targeted assessments of conceptual or visual features. In other words, activity patterns in PRC captured the conceptual similarity between hairdryer and comb, as well as the visual similarity between hairdryer and gun, and did so irrespective of task context. Critically, these results were obtained despite the fact that the brain-based RDMs were orthogonal to one another (i.e. not significantly correlated). Considered together, these results suggest that, of the a priori ROIs considered, PRC represents object concepts at the highest level of specificity through integration of visual and conceptual features. 


### ROI-based RSA: comparison of corpus-based (word2vec) semantic RDM with brain-based RDMs 
  
For the purpose of comparison, we next examined similarities between the word2vec RDM and the brain-based RDMs using the same procedures described in the previous section. Results are presented in  . These analyses revealed significant positive correlations between the word2vec RDM and the brain-based conceptual task RDMs in parahippocampal cortex (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.05, p<0.01), PRC (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.035, p<0.01), and the temporal pole (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.029, p<0.01). The word2vec RDM was also significantly correlated with the brain-based visual task RDMs in PRC (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.025, p<0.05) and the temporal pole (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.027, p<0.05). Notably, this pattern of results was identical to that obtained using the behavior-based conceptual RDMs in parahippocampal cortex, PRC, and the temporal pole. Interestingly, however, the word2vec RDM was also significantly correlated with the brain-based visual task RDMs in LOC (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.028, p<0.05). This result is consistent with the observation that the word2vec RDM was significantly correlated with our behavior-based visual RDM, and further suggests that corpus-based models of semantic memory likely capture similarities between object concepts at the level of abstract conceptual properties and visual semantics. 


### ROI-based RSA: comparisons of brain-based RDMs within ROIs 
  
Having examined the relationships between behavior-based RDMs and brain-based RDMs, we next sought to directly characterize the relationships between brain-based conceptual and visual RDMs within each ROI (these comparisons are denoted by the dashed horizontal arrow in the bottom of  ). These analyses were conducted using the same methodological procedures used to compare behavior-based RDMs with brain-based RDMs in the previous section. A Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons (16 brain-based comparisons, yielding a critical alpha of. 003). Using second-level RSAs, we asked whether the brain-based visual task RDMs and brain-based conceptual task RDMs had a common similarity structure within a given ROI. Results are plotted in  . Importantly, we found a significant positive correlation in PRC (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.063, p<0.0001), and a trend toward a significant correlation in the temporal pole (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.032, p=0.012). Conversely, brain-based visual and conceptual task RDMs were not significantly correlated in either parahippocampal cortex (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.008, p=0.12), or LOC (Kendall’s tau-a = −0.008, p=0.92). These results suggest that object concepts were represented similarly within PRC, and to a lesser extent within the temporal pole, regardless of whether they were encountered in a visual or conceptual task context.

### ROI-based RSA: comparisons of brain-based RDMs across ROIs 
  
We next conducted second-level RSAs to quantify representational similarities between the brain-based visual task RDMs obtained across different ROIs. In other words, we asked whether activity in different ROIs (e.g. PRC and LOC) reflected similar representational distinctions across object concepts within the visual task context. Results are plotted in  . Interestingly, these analyses did not reveal any significant results between any of our ROIs (all Kendall’s tau-a <0.01, all p>0.07). These findings indicate that PRC and LOC, two regions that expressed a visual similarity code, represented different aspects of the visual object features. 

Finally, we quantified the representational similarities between the brain-based conceptual task RDMs obtained across different ROIs. In other words, we asked whether activity in different ROIs (e.g. PRC and the temporal pole) reflected similar representational distinctions across object concepts within the conceptual task context. Results are plotted in  . This set of analyses did not reveal any significant results between any of our ROIs (all Kendall’s tau-a <0.016, all p>0.012). These findings indicate that the three regions that expressed a conceptual similarity code (i.e., PRC, parahippocampal cortex, and temporal pole), represented different aspects of the conceptual object features. 


### ROI-based RSA: comparisons of within-object multi-voxel activity patterns across different task contexts 
  
The RSAs reported thus far have quantified relationships among behavior-based and brain-based RDMs that reflected similarities between different object concepts (e.g. between ‘hairdryer’ and ‘comb’). We next quantified within-object similarities (e.g. between ‘hairdryer’ and ‘hairdryer’) across visual and conceptual task contexts (e.g. ‘is it living?’ or ‘is it angular?”) using first-level RSAs. Specifically, we calculated one dissimilarity value (1 – Pearson’s   r  ) between the mean multi-voxel activity patterns evoked by a given object concept across different task contexts. These 40 within-object dissimilarity values were expressed along the diagonal of an RDM for each ROI in each participant, separately ( ). We next calculated mean within-object dissimilarity by averaging across the diagonal of each RDM for the purpose of performing statistical inference.

Participant-specific Pearson’s   r   co-efficients are contained in   - Comparison of within-object similarity across task contexts. 


  
Results are presented in  . Within-object similarity did not differ from zero in either LOC (Pearson’s   r   = 0.007, p=0.20) or parahippocampal cortex (Pearson’s   r   = −0.008, p=0.87), suggesting that a given object concept was represented differently across the visual and conceptual task contexts in these ROIs. These findings are consistent with the task-dependent nature of the similarity codes we observed in these regions ( ). Conversely, within-object similarity was significantly greater than zero in the temporal pole (Pearson’s   r   = 0.34, p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected for four comparisons), indicating that this structure represents a given object concept similarly across different task contexts. This observation is consistent with results from the previous section which revealed that the similarities between object concepts in the temporal pole are preserved across task contexts ( ). These findings reflected the fact that the same conceptual object information (e.g. ‘  used to style hair  ’ and ‘  found in salons  ’) was carried in multi-voxel activity patterns obtained in each task context ( ). Within-object similarity was also significantly greater than zero in PRC (Pearson’s   r   = 0.41, p<0.01, Bonferroni corrected for four comparisons), again indicating that a given object concept was represented similarly across different task contexts. This finding dovetails with our result from the previous section which revealed that the similarities between object concepts in PRC were preserved across task contexts ( ). When considered together, we interpret this pattern of results in PRC as further evidence of integrative coding, reflecting the fact that this structure carried the same conceptual (e.g. ‘  used to style hair  ’ and ‘   found in salons   ’) and visual (e.g. visually similar to a gun) object information in both task contexts ( ). 


### Searchlight-based RSA: comparisons of behavior-based RDMs with brain-based RDMs 
  
#### Perirhinal cortex is the only cortical region that supports integrative coding of conceptual and visual object features 
  
We next implemented a whole-volume searchlight-based RSA to further characterize the neuroanatomical specificity of our ROI-based results. Specifically, we sought to determine whether object representations in PRC expressed visual and conceptual similarity structure within overlapping or distinct populations of voxels. If PRC does indeed support the integrative coding of visual and conceptual object features, then the same set of voxels should express both types of similarity codes. If PRC does not support the integrative coding of visual and conceptual object features, then different subsets of voxels should express these different similarity codes. More generally, data-driven searchlight mapping allowed us to explore whether any other regions of the brain showed evidence for integrative coding of visual and conceptual features in a manner comparable to that observed in PRC. To this end, we performed searchlight RSA using multi-voxel activity patterns restricted to a 100 voxel ROI that was iteratively swept across the entire cortical surface ( ;  ). In each searchlight ROI, the behavior-based RDMs were compared with the brain-based RDMs using a procedure identical to that implemented in our ROI-based RSA. These comparisons are depicted by the solid black vertical and diagonal arrows in  . The obtained similarity values (Pearson’s   r  ) were Fisher-  z   transformed and mapped to the center of each ROI for each participant separately. With this approach, we obtained participant-specific similarity maps for all comparisons, which were then standardized and subjected to a group-level statistical analysis. A threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) method was used to correct for multiple comparisons with a cluster threshold of p<0.05 ( ). 

Statistically thresholded group-level similarity maps depicting cortical regions in which behavior- and brain-based RDMs were significantly correlated are presented for the visual task context in  , and for the conceptual task context in  . Corresponding cluster statistics, co-ordinates, and neuroanatomical labels are reported in  . Importantly, results from our whole-volume searchlight mapping analysis showed a high degree of consistency with our ROI-based results. First, we found evidence for visual similarity coding in the visual task context in aspects of right LOC ( ), as well as aspects of early visual cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and areas of medial and lateral ventral temporal cortex ( ). Next, we revealed conceptual similarity coding in the conceptual task context within a cluster of voxels that straddled the border between right parahippocampal cortex and PRC ( ). Although this cluster was only partially situated with parahippocampal cortex, it is interesting to note that its posterior extent did slightly encroach upon anterior aspects of the parahippocampal place area (PPA; functionally defined using a group-level GLM (scenes > objects);  ), which has previously been linked to the representation of abstract conceptual information ( ;  ;  ). Moreover, we found evidence of conceptual similarity coding in bilateral aspects of the temporal pole in both task contexts (  and  ), an observation that is consistent with results from multiple prior studies that have demonstrated conceptual similarity structure this aspect of the ATL ( ;  ; cf  ). Finally, and most importantly, results from the whole-brain searchlight revealed evidence for visual similarity coding and conceptual similarity coding in PRC in both task contexts (  and  ). This result dovetails with findings from previous RSA-based fMRI research that has demonstrated conceptual similarity coding in PRC ( ;  ; cf  ).

Although suggestive, neither the searchlight- nor the ROI-based RSA results presented thus far necessarily imply integrative coding in PRC. Indeed, it is possible that visual and conceptual object information was carried in spatially distinct sub-regions of this structure. To examine this issue, we first asked whether any voxels showed both visual and conceptual similarity coding in the visual task context (similarity maps in  , respectively) using a voxel overlap analysis ( ). Importantly, we revealed a contiguous cluster of voxels that was unique to left PRC in which both behavior-based RDMs predicted the similarity structure in the brain-based visual task RDMs. This result indicated that a subset of voxels in PRC carried information about visual   and   conceptual object information even when task demands biased attention toward visual object features. We next asked whether any voxels showed both visual and conceptual similarity coding in the conceptual task context (similarity maps in  , respectively) using a second voxel overlap analysis ( ). This analysis also revealed a contiguous cluster of voxels that was unique to left PRC in which both behavior-based RDMs predicted the similarity structure in the brain-based conceptual task RDMs. This finding indicated that a subset of voxels in PRC carried information about visual   and   conceptual object information when task demands biased attention toward conceptual object features.

In a final step using a third voxel overlap analysis, we examined whether any voxels showed both visual and conceptual similarity coding in both the visual and conceptual task contexts ( ). This analysis revealed a contiguous cluster of voxels in left PRC in which both behavior-based RDMs predicted the similarity structure captured by both brain-based RDMs. This result indicated that a subset of voxels that were unique to PRC carried information about visual   and   conceptual object information regardless of whether task demands biased attention toward visual   or   conceptual object features. Ultimately, this pattern of results suggests that not only does PRC carry both visual and conceptual object information, but it does so in the same subset of voxels. 




## Discussion 
  
Decades of research has been aimed at understanding how object concepts are represented in the brain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), yet the fundamental question of whether and where their visual and conceptual features are integrated remains unanswered. Progress toward this end has been hindered by the fact that these features tend to vary concomitantly across object concepts. Here, we used a data-driven approach to systematically select a set of object concepts in which visual and conceptual features varied independently (e.g. hairdryer – comb, which are conceptually similar but visually distinct; hairdryer – gun, which are visually similar but conceptually distinct). Using RSA of fMRI data, we revealed novel evidence of task-dependent visual similarity coding in LOC, task-dependent conceptual similarity coding in parahippocampal cortex, task-invariant coding in the temporal pole, and task-invariant integrative coding in PRC. 

Several aspects of our data provide novel support for the notion that PRC uniquely represents the visual and conceptual features that define fully specified object concepts in an integrated similarity code. First, this was the only region of the brain in which both visual   and   conceptual object coding was revealed. Moreover, these effects were observed regardless of whether fMRI task demands biased attention toward visual   or   conceptual object features. These results are particularly striking given the fact that they were revealed using a behavior-based visual similarity model and a behavior-based conceptual similarity model that were orthogonal to one another. In other words, the degree of similarity between multi-voxel activity patterns obtained while participants made conceptual judgments, such as whether a ‘hairdryer’ is man-made or a ‘gun’ is pleasant, was captured by the degree of visual similarity between these object concepts. Likewise, the degree of similarity between multi-voxel activity patterns obtained while participants made visual judgments, such as whether a ‘hairdryer’ is angular or a ‘comb’ is elongated, was captured by the degree of conceptual similarity between these object concepts. In both cases, PRC carried information about pre-existing representations of object features that were neither required to perform the immediate task at hand, nor correlated with the features that did in fact have task-relevant diagnostic value. Moreover, we also found that the brain-based visual task RDMs and brain-based conceptual task RDMs were correlated with one another across task contexts in PRC. That is to say, the similarity between ‘hairdryer’ and ‘gun’ was comparable regardless of whether task demands biased attention toward visual or conceptual features. Likewise, we also revealed that PRC also represented a given object concept similarly across task contexts, that is, ‘hairdryer’ evoked a pattern of activation that was comparable across task contexts. When considered together, these results suggest that, at the level of PRC, it may not be possible to fully disentangle conceptual and perceptual information. An important but challenging objective for future research will be to determine whether this pattern of results can be replicated at the level of individual neurons. 

What is the behavioral relevance of fully specified object representations in which visual and conceptual features are integrated? It has previously been suggested that such representations allow for discrimination among stimuli with extensive feature overlap, such as exemplars from the same category ( ;  ;  ;  ). In line with this view, individuals with medial ATL lesions that include PRC typically have more pronounced conceptual impairments related to living than non-living things ( ;  ;  ), and more striking perceptual impairments for objects that are visually similar as compared to visually distinct ( ,  ;  ). Functional MRI studies in neurologically healthy individuals have also demonstrated increased PRC engagement for living as compared to non-living objects ( ), for known as compared to novel faces ( ;  ), and for faces or conceptually meaningless stimuli with high feature overlap as compared to low feature overlap ( ;  ). In a related manner, fully specified object representations in PRC have also been implicated in long-term memory judgments. For example, PRC has been linked to explicit recognition memory judgments when previously studied and novel items are from the same stimulus category ( ;  ;  ), and when subjects make judgments about their lifetime of experience with a given object concept ( ). Common among these task demands is the requirement to discriminate among highly similar stimuli. In such scenarios, a fully specified representation that reflects the integration of perceptual and conceptual features necessarily enables more fine-grained distinctions than a purely perceptual or conceptual representation. 

This study also has significant implications for prominent neurocognitive models of semantic memory in which the ATL is characterized as a semantic hub ( ;  ;  ). On this view, the bilateral ATLs are thought to constitute a trans-modal convergence zone that abstracts conceptual information from the co-occurrence of features otherwise represented in a distributed manner across modality-specific cortical nodes. Consistent with this idea, we have shown that a behavior-based conceptual similarity model predicted the similarity structure of neural activity patterns in the temporal pole, irrespective of task context. Specifically, neural activity patterns associated with conceptually similar object concepts that are visually distinct (e.g. hairdryer – comb) were more comparable than were conceptually dissimilar concepts that are visually similar (e.g. hairdryer – gun), even when task demands required a critical assessment of visual features. This observation, together with results obtained in PRC, demonstrates a representational distinction between these ATL structures, a conclusion that dovetails with recent evidence indicating that this region is not functionally homogeneous ( ;  ). Ultimately, this outcome suggests that some ATL sub-regions play a prominent role in task-invariant extraction of conceptual object properties (e.g. temporal pole), whereas others appear to make differential contributions to the task-invariant integration of perceptual and conceptual features (e.g. PRC) ( ;  ). 

Convergent evidence from studies of functional and structural connectivity in humans, non-human primates, and rodents have revealed that PRC is connected to the temporal pole, parahippocampal cortex, LOC, and nearly all other unimodal and polymodal sensory regions in neocortex ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Importantly, our results have linked LOC to the representation of visual object features, and the temporal pole and parahippocampal cortex to the representation of conceptual object features. Thus, PRC has the connectivity properties that make it well suited to be a trans-modal convergence zone capable of integrating object features that are both visual and conceptual in nature. An interesting challenge for future research will be to determine how differentially attending to specific types of object features shapes functional connectivity profiles between these regions. 

Although speculative, results from the current study suggest that attention may modulate information both within and between the ROIs examined. First, we see visual similarity coding in LOC only when task demands biased attention to visual object features, and conceptual similarity coding in parahippocampal cortex only when task demands biased attention to conceptual object features. Second, we saw a trend toward an interaction between behavior-based models and fMRI task context in PRC, such that visual similarity coding was more pronounced in the visual task context than was conceptual similarity coding, and vice versa. Thus, attending to specific types of features did not merely manifest as univariate gain modulation. Rather, attention appeared to modulated multi-voxel activity patterns. 

Another novel aspect of our findings is that parahippocampal cortex exhibited conceptual similarity coding in the conceptual task context. Interestingly, it has been suggested that this structure broadly contributes to cognition by processing contextual associations, including the co-occurrence of objects within a context ( ;  ). Critically, objects that regularly co-occur in the same context (e.g. ‘comb’ and ‘hairdryer’ in a barbershop) often share many conceptual features (e.g. functional properties such as ‘  used to style hair  ’), but do not necessarily share many visual features. Thus, object-evoked responses in parahippocampal cortex may express feature-based conceptual similarity structure because objects with many shared conceptual features bring to mind an associated context, whereas objects that are visually similar but conceptually distinct do not (e.g. hairdryer and gun). We note, however, that the current study was not designed to test-specific hypotheses about the contextual co-occurrence of objects, or how co-occurrence relates to conceptual feature statistics. Ultimately, a mechanistic account of object-based coding in PHC will require further research using a carefully selected stimulus set in which the strength of contextual associations (i.e. co-occurrence) between object concepts is not confounded with conceptual features. 

In summary, this study sheds new light on our understanding of how object concepts are represented in the brain. Specifically, we revealed that PRC represented object concepts in a task-invariant, integrative similarity code that captured the visual and conceptual relatedness among stimuli. Most critically, this result was obtained despite systematically dissociating visual and conceptual features across object concepts. Moreover, the striking neuroanatomical specificity of this result suggests that PRC uniquely supports integration across these fundamentally different types of features. Ultimately, this pattern of results implicates PRC in the representation of fully-specified objects. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
#### Behavior-based visual similarity rating task and conceptual feature generation task 
  
A total of 2846 individuals completed online behavioral tasks using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk ( ). Data from 61 participants were discarded due to technical errors, incomplete submissions, or missed catch trials. Of the remaining 2785 participants, 1185 completed the visual similarity rating task (616 males, 569 females; age range = 18–53; mean age = 30.1), and 1600 completed the semantic feature generation task (852 males, 748 females; age range = 18–58 years; mean age = 31.7). These sample sizes are proportionally in line with those reported by  . Individuals who completed the visual similarity rating task were excluded from completing the feature generation task, and vice versa. All participants provided informed consent and were compensated for their time. Both online tasks were approved by the University of Toronto Ethics Review Board. 


#### Brain-based fMRI task 
  
A separate group consisting of sixteen right-handed participants took part in the fMRI experiment (10 female; age range = 19–29 years; mean age = 23.1 years). This sample size is in line with extant fMRI studies that have used comparable analytical procedures to test hypotheses pertaining to object representation in the ventral visual stream and ATL ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ; ;  ;  ). Due to technical problems, we were unable to obtain data from one experimental run in two different participants. No participants were removed due to excessive motion using a criterion of 1.5 mm of translational displacement. All participants gave informed consent, reported that they were native English speakers, free of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and had normal or corrected to normal vision. Participants were compensated $50. This study was approved by the Baycrest Hospital Research Ethics Board. 



### Stimuli 
  
As a starting point, we chained together a list of 80 object concepts in such a way that adjacent items in the list alternated between being conceptually similar but visually distinct and visually similar but conceptually distinct (e.g. bullet – gun – hairdryer – comb; bullet and gun are conceptually but not visually similar, whereas gun and hairdryer are visually but not conceptually similar, and hairdryer and comb are conceptually but not visually similar, etc.). Our initial stimulus set was established using the authors’ subjective impressions. The visual and conceptual similarities between all pairs of object concepts were then quantified by human observers in the context of a visual similarity rating task and a conceptual feature generation task, respectively. Results from these behavioral tasks were then used to select 40 object concepts used throughout the current study. 

Participants who completed the visual similarity rating task were presented with 40 pairs of words and asked to rate visual similarity between the object concepts to which they referred ( ). Responses were made using a 5-point scale (very dissimilar, somewhat dissimilar, neutral, somewhat similar, very similar). Each participant was also presented with four catch trials on which an object concept was paired with itself. Across participants, 95.7% of catch trials were rated as being very similar. Data were excluded from 28 participants who did not rate all four catch trials as being at least ‘somewhat similar’. Every pair of object concepts from the initial set of 80 object concepts (3160) was rated by 15 different participants. 

We next quantified conceptual similarities between object concepts based on responses obtained in a conceptual feature generation task ( ), following task instructions previously described by  . Each participant was presented with one object concept and asked to produce a list of up to 15 different types of descriptive features, including functional properties (e.g. what it is used for, where it is used, and when it is used), physical properties (e.g. how it looks, sounds, smells, feels, and tastes), and other facts about it, such as the category to which it belongs or other encyclopedic facts (e.g. where it is from). One example object and its corresponding features from a normative database were presented as an example ( ). Interpretation and organization of written responses were guided by criteria described by  . Features were obtained from 20 different participants for each object concept. Data were excluded from 33 participants who failed to list any features. A total of 4851 unique features were produced across all 80 object concepts and participants. Features listed by fewer than 4 out of 20 participants were considered to be unreliable and discarded for the purpose of all subsequent analyses, leaving 723 unique features. This exclusion criterion is proportionally comparable to that used by  . On average, each of the 80 object concepts was associated with 10.6 features. 

We used a data-driven approach to select a subset of 40 object concepts from the initial 80-item set. These 40 object concepts are reflected in the behavior-based visual and conceptual RDMs, and were used as stimuli in our fMRI experiment. Specifically, we first ensured that each object concept was visually similar, but conceptually dissimilar, to at least one other item (e.g. hairdryer – gun), and conceptually similar, but visually dissimilar, to at least one different item (e.g. hairdryer – comb). Second, in an effort to ensure that visual and conceptual features varied independently across object concepts, stimuli were selected such that the corresponding behavior-based visual and conceptual similarity models were not correlated with one another. 


### Behavior-based RDMs 
  
#### Behavior-based visual RDM 
  
A behavior-based model that captured visual dissimilarities between all pairs of object concepts included in the fMRI experiment (40 object concepts) was derived from the visual similarity judgments obtained from our online rating task. Specifically, similarity ratings for each pair of object concepts were averaged across participants, normalized, and expressed within a 40 × 40 RDM (1 – averaged normalized rating). Thus, the value in a given cell of this RDM reflects the visual similarity of the object concepts at that intersection. This behavior-based visual RDM is our visual dissimilarity model. 


#### Behavior-based conceptual RDM 
  
A behavior-based model that captured conceptual dissimilarities between all pairs of object concepts included in the fMRI experiment was derived from data obtained in our online feature-generation task. In order to ensure that the semantic relationships captured by our conceptual similarity model were not influenced by verbal descriptions of visual attributes, we systematically removed features that characterized either visual form or color (e.g. ‘is round’ or ‘is red’). Using these criteria a total of 58 features (8% of the total number of features provided) were removed. We next quantified conceptual similarity using a concept-feature matrix in which columns corresponded to object concepts (i.e. 40 columns) and rows to the conceptual features associated with those objects (i.e. 282 rows) ( , center). Specifically, we computed the cosine angle between each row; cosine similarity reflects the conceptual distances between object concepts such that high cosine similarities between items denote short conceptual distance. The conceptual dissimilarities between all pairs of object concepts were expressed as a 40 × 40 RDM. The value within each cell of the conceptual model RDM was calculated as 1 – the cosine similarity value between the corresponding object concepts. This behavior-based conceptual RDM is our conceptual dissimilarity model. 


#### Behavior-based RSA: comparison of behavior-based RDMs 
  
We next quantified similarity between our behavior-based visual RDM and behavior-based conceptual RDM using Kendall’s tau-a as the relatedness measure. This ranked correlation coefficient is the most appropriate inferential statistic to use when comparing sparse RDMs that predict many tied ranks (i.e. both models predict complete dissimilarity between many object pairs;  ). Statistical analysis of model similarity was performed using a stimulus-label randomization test (10,000 iterations) that simulated the null hypothesis of unrelated RDMs (i.e. zero correlation) based on the obtained variance. Significance was assessed through comparison of the obtained Kendall’s tau-a coefficient to the equivalent distribution of ranked null values. As noted in the Results section, this analysis revealed that our behavior-based visual and conceptual RDMs were not significantly correlated (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.01, p=0.10). Moreover, inclusion of the 58 features that described color and visual form in the behavior-based conceptual RDM did not significantly alter its relationship with the visual behavior-based visual RDM (Kendall’s tau-a = 0.01, p=0.09). 



### Experimental procedures: fMRI feature verification task 
  
During scanning, participants completed a feature verification task that required a yes/no judgment indicating whether a given feature was applicable to a specific object concept on a trial-by-trial basis. We systematically varied the feature verification probes in a manner that established a visual feature verification task context and conceptual feature verification task context. Verification probes comprising the visual task context were selected to encourage processing of the visual semantic features that characterize each object concept (i.e. shape, color, and surface detail). To this end, eight specific probes were used: shape [(angular, rounded), (elongated, symmetrical)], color (light, dark), and surface (smooth, rough). Notably, all features are associated with two opposing probes (e.g. angular and rounded; natural and manufactured) to ensure that participants made an equal number of ‘yes’ and ‘no’ responses. Verification probes comprising the conceptual feature verification task context were selected to encourage processing of the abstract conceptual features that characterize each object concept (i.e. animacy, origin, function, and affective associations). To this end, eight specific verification probes were used: (living, non-living), (manufactured, natural), (tool, non-tool), (pleasant, unpleasant). 


### Procedures 
  
The primary experimental task was evenly divided over eight runs of functional data acquisition. Each run lasted 7 m 56 s and was evenly divided into two blocks, each of which corresponded to either a visual verification task context or a conceptual feature verification task context. The order of task blocks was counter-balanced across participants. Each block was associated with a different feature verification probe, with the first and second block in each run separated by 12 s of rest. Blocks began with an 8 s presentation of a feature verification probe that was to be referenced for all intra-block trials. With this design, each object concept was repeated 16 times: eight repetitions across the visual feature verification task context and eight repetitions across the conceptual feature verification task context. Behavioral responses were recorded using an MR-compatible keypad. 

Stimuli were centrally presented for 2 s and each trial was separated by a jittered period of baseline fixation that ranged 2–6 s. Trial order and jitter interval were optimized for each run using the OptSeq2 algorithm ( ), with unique sequences and timing across counterbalanced versions of the experiment. Stimulus presentation and timing was controlled by E-Prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). 


### Experimental procedure: fMRI functional localizer task 
  
Following completion of the main experimental task, each participant completed an independent functional localizer scan that was subsequently used to identify LOC. Participants viewed objects, scrambled objects, words, scrambled words, faces, and scenes in separate 24 s blocks (12 functional volumes). Within each block, 32 images were presented for 400 ms each with a 350 ms ISI. There were four groups of six blocks, with each group separated by a 12 s fixation period, and each block corresponding to a different stimulus category. Block order (i.e. stimulus category) was counterbalanced across groups. All stimuli were presented in the context of a 1-back task to ensure that participants remained engaged throughout the entire scan. Presentation of images within blocks was pseudo-random with 1-back repetition occurring 1–2 times per block. 


### ROI definitions 
  
We performed RSA in four a priori defined ROIs. The temporal pole, PRC, and parahippocampal cortex were manually defined in both the left and right hemisphere on each participant’s high-resolution anatomical image according to established MR-based protocols ( ), with adjustment of posterior border of parahippocampal cortex using anatomical landmarks described by  ). Lateral occipital cortex was defined as the set of contiguous voxels located along the lateral extent of the occipital lobe that responded more strongly to intact than scrambled objects (p<0.001, uncorrected;  ). 


### fMRI data acquisition 
  
Scanning was performed using a 3.0 T Siemens MAGNETOM Trio MRI scanner at the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Hospital using a 32-channel receiver head coil. Each scanning session began with the acquisition of a whole-brain high-resolution magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo T1-weighted structural image (repetition time = 2 s, echo time = 2.63 ms, flip angle = 9°, field of view = 25.6 cm , 160 oblique axial slices, 192 × 256 matrix, slice thickness = 1 mm). During each of eight functional scanning runs comprising the main experimental task, a total of 238 T2*-weighted echo-planar images were acquired using a two-shot gradient echo sequence (200 × 200 mm field of view with a 64 × 64 matrix size), resulting in an in-plane resolution of 3.1 × 3.1 mm for each of 40 2 mm axial slices that were acquired in an interleaved manner along the axis of the hippocampus. The inter-slice gap was 0.5 mm; repetition time = 2 s; echo time = 30 ms; flip angle = 78°). These parameters yielded coverage of the majority of cortex, excluding only the most superior aspects of the frontal and parietal lobes. During a single functional localizer scan, a total of 360 T2*-weighted echo-planar images were acquired using the same parameters reported for the main experimental task. Lastly, a B0 field map was collected following completion of the functional localizer scan  


### fMRI data analysis software 
  
Preprocessing and GLM analyses were performed in FSL5 ( ). Representational similarity analyses were performed using CoSMoMVPA ( ;  ). 


### Preprocessing and estimation of object-specific multi-voxel activity patterns 
  
Images were initially skull-stripped using a brain extraction tool (BET,  ) to remove non-brain tissue from the image. Data were then corrected for slice-acquisition time, high-pass temporally filtered (using a 50-s period cut-off for event-related runs, and a 128 s period cut-off for the blocked localizer run), and motion corrected (MCFLIRT,  ). Functional runs were registered to each participant’s high-resolution MPRAGE image using FLIRT boundary-based registration with B0-fieldmap correction. The resulting unsmoothed data were analyzed using first-level FEAT (v6.00; fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) in each participant’s native anatomical space. Parameter estimates of BOLD response amplitude were computed using FILM, with a general linear model that included temporal autocorrelation correction and six motion parameters as nuisance covariates. Each trial (i.e. object concept) was modeled with a delta function corresponding to the stimulus presentation onset and then convolved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function. Separate response-amplitude (β) images were created for each object concept (n = 40), in each run (n = 8), in each property verification task context (n = 2). Obtained β images were converted into   t  -statistic maps; previous research has demonstrated a modest advantage for   t  -maps over β images in the context of multi-voxel pattern analysis ( ). In a final step, we created mean object-specific   t  -maps by averaging across runs. These data were used for all subsequent similarity analyses. 


### Representational similarity analysis (RSA) 
  
#### ROI-based first-level RSA 
  
We used linear correlations to quantify the participant-specific dissimilarities (1 – Pearson’s r) between all object-evoked multi-voxel activity patterns (n = 40) within each ROI (n = 4). Participant-specific dissimilarity measures were expressed in 40 × 40 RDMs for each verification task context (n = 2), separately. Thus, for each ROI, each participant had one RDM that reflected the dissimilarity structure from the visual feature verification task context (i.e. brain-based visual task RDM), and one RDM that reflected the dissimilarity structure from the conceptual verification task context (i.e., brain-based conceptual task RDM). 


#### ROI-based second-level RSA 
  
We performed second-level RSAs, that is, we compared RDMs derived from first-level RSAs, to quantify similarities among behavior-based RDMs and brain-based RDMs. Similarity was quantified in each participant using the ranked correlation coefficient (Kendall’s tau-a) between RDMs. Inferential statistical analyses were performed using a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test across subject-specific RDM correlations to test for significance. This non-parametric test provides valid inference and treats the variation across subjects as a random effect, thus supporting generalization of results beyond the sample. A Bonferroni correction was applied in each analysis to compensate for the number of second-level comparisons. 


#### Searchlight-based RSA 
  
Whole-volume RSA was implemented using 100-voxel surface-based searchlights ( ;  ). Each surface-based searchlight referenced the 100 nearest voxels to the searchlight center based on geodesic distance on the cortical surface. Neural estimates of dissimilarity (i.e. RDMs) were calculated in each searchlight using the same approach implemented in our ROI-based RSA. Correlations between behavior-based RDMs were also quantified using the same approach. The correlation coefficients obtained between behavior-based RDMs and brain-based RDMs were then Fisher-  z   transformed and mapped to the voxel at the centre of each searchlight to create a whole-brain similarity map. Participant-specific similarity maps were then normalized to a standard MNI template using FNIRT ( ). To assess the statistical significance of searchlight maps across participants, all maps were corrected for multiple comparisons without choosing an arbitrary uncorrected threshold using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) with a corrected statistical threshold of p<0.05 on the cluster level ( ). A Monte Carlo simulation permuting condition labels was used to estimate a null TFCE distribution. First, 100 null searchlight maps were generated for each participant by randomly permuting condition labels within each obtained searchlight RDM. Next, 10,000 null TFCE maps were constructed by randomly sampling from these null data sets in order to estimate a null TFCE distribution ( ). The resulting surface-based statistically thresholded   z  -score were projected onto the PALS-B12 surface atlas in CARET version 5.6. ( ;  ;  ).

# Abstract
 
## Background and objectives 
  
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus is a promising therapeutic alternative for treating medically refractory Tourette syndrome (TS). However, few human studies have examined its mechanism of action. Therefore, the networks that mediate the therapeutic effects of thalamic DBS remain poorly understood. 


## Methods 
  
Five participants diagnosed with severe medically refractory TS underwent bilateral thalamic DBS stereotactic surgery. Intraoperative fMRI characterized the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response evoked by thalamic DBS and determined whether the therapeutic effectiveness of thalamic DBS, as assessed using the Modified Rush Video Rating Scale test, would correlate with evoked BOLD responses in motor and limbic cortical and subcortical regions. 


## Results 
  
Our results reveal that thalamic stimulation in TS participants has wide-ranging effects that impact the frontostriatal, limbic, and motor networks. Thalamic stimulation induced suppression of motor and insula networks correlated with motor tic reduction, while suppression of frontal and parietal networks correlated with vocal tic reduction. These regions mapped closely to major regions of interest (ROI) identified in a nonhuman primate model of TS. 


## Conclusions 
  
Overall, these findings suggest that a critical factor in TS treatment should involve modulation of both frontostriatal and motor networks, rather than be treated as a focal disorder of the brain. Using the novel combination of DBS-evoked tic reduction and fMRI in human subjects, we provide new insights into the basal ganglia-cerebellar-thalamo-cortical network-level mechanisms that influence the effects of thalamic DBS. Future translational research should identify whether these network changes are cause or effect of TS symptoms. 

   Highlights  
  
Translational approach applied to Tourettes patients by utilizing combined DBS fMRI. 
  
Thalamic electrical stimulation evokes motor and limbic BOLD activation. 
  
Motor and limbic BOLD activation differentially related to motor and vocal tics. 
  
Tic reduction negatively correlates with insula cortex, especially with motor tics. 
  
Suppression of frontal and parietal networks correlate with vocal tic reduction.

## Introduction 
  
Often presenting a constellation of unusual repetitive movement and vocalization behaviors, Tourette syndrome (TS) is a complex, developmental neuropsychiatric disorder. In many cases, it generally resolves with maturation, however, severe cases can persist into adulthood and can have a serious impact on patient quality of life and medical resources ( ). Clinically, TS is defined by persistent stereotypic motor and vocal tics, and by pre-tic premonitory urges or compulsions ( ;  ;  ). The combination of motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms ( ), suggests that the pathophysiology of TS is mediated by dysregulation of the basal ganglia-cerebellar-thalamo-cortical (BGCTC) networks, involving frontal, limbic and motor areas of the basal ganglia (BG) ( ;  ;  ). In support of both motor and limbic BG circuitry involvement in tic generation, utilizing in vivo electrophysiology and imaging, McCairn et al. found that in nonhuman primates (NHP), focal disinhibition of putamen (PT) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) can induce myoclonic (motor) and vocal (limbic) tics, respectively ( ). This led to the suggestion that, despite BG-located focal abnormalities, TS-like states should be considered as functionally specific, global network dysrhythmias ( ,  ,  ). 

For participants with severe, medically refractory TS, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is increasingly considered a viable option ( ;  ;  ;  ). DBS is thought to relieve symptoms of conditions by applying relatively small amplitude electrical stimulation to dysfunctional brain networks and modulating pathological brain activity at the stimulation target site with up and downstream network effects playing a prominent role ( ;  ;  ). DBS of the thalamus has been reported to alleviate both motor and vocal tics in TS ( ), but its therapeutic and network mechanisms remain unknown. 

Located in the posterior intralaminar thalamus, the centromedian and parafascicularis complex (CMPf) is uniquely situated to modulate both motor and limbic networks ( ;  ;  ) and has thus been considered a viable DBS target for TS ( ). As part of the diffuse thalamocortical projection system, the CMPf sends direct neuronal projections to limbic areas, including amygdala (AM) ( ), hippocampus (HP) ( ), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula ( ;  ). The CMPf also has extensive projections throughout the striatum (caudate/PT), NAc, and globus pallidus ( ;  ;  ;  ). The CMPf complex of thalamus provides unique access to both motor and limbic networks that has been shown to be related to complex tic behaviors in NHP-TS models ( ). 

Here, we address the proposed global network dysrhythmia hypothesis as inferred from NHP-TS studies by determining correlates of brain wide activity induced by DBS using high frequency stimulation (HFS) of the thalamus (CMPf) with reductions in TS symptoms (motor and vocal tics). DBS surgery was performed on participants with severe medically-refractive TS who exhibited complex motor and vocal tics. Thereafter, BGCTC network properties were assessed using intraoperative (intra-OR) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during thalamic HFS. This method has been previously used for thalamic HFS in essential tremor subjects ( ). Intra-OR fMRI results were correlated with post-operative behavioral scores to measure tic frequency, severity, and impairment levels in which participants and judges were blinded to stimulation parameters ( ;  ). To further separate the possible inter-correlation effects between vocal and motor tic reduction, standard and partial correlation methods were used to separate out the unique portions of variation in each behavioral measure that were associated with fMRI blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
This study included five participants (2 females, 3 males; mean age of 27 years) conducting a total of 25 fMRI scans with 12 tic behavioral score tests. The participants diagnosed with TS underwent bilateral CMPf DBS stereotactic surgery. The diagnosis of TS was based on the DSM-5307.22 diagnostic criteria for chronic motor and vocal (phonic) tic disorder ( ). All participants were approved for surgery by the Mayo Clinic DBS Committee, which is composed of neurologists, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, speech pathologists, and a biomedical ethicist. In all participants, TS symptoms predominantly affected the bilateral upper extremities with both simple and complex motor and vocal (phonic) tic, and in some participant's tremor also affected the head, jaw, and/or voice (Table S1). This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided written informed consent.

### Surgical approach 
  
Each participant was secured within the Leksell™ stereotactic head frame (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) and a 1.5 T structural MRI (General Electric Signa HDx and 16× software) scan was performed prior to implantation using magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence ( ). The MRI data were merged with a stereotaxy human brain atlas ( ), and stereotactic coordinates were identified for the CMPf thalamic complex (9.5–11.0 mm posterior, 5.0–7.0 mm lateral, 1.5–3.0 mm inferior to the mid AC-PC line). Quadripolar 3387 dB leads (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) were implanted bilaterally and lead placement was confirmed by computed tomography (Sensation 64, Siemens): image resolution: 0.59 × 0.59 × 1.00 mm . With reference to a functional probabilistic human brain atlas ( ), post-hoc analysis of CT-MR fusion data of the region of thalamus occupied by the DBS lead electrode contacts implanted confirmed that they were centered on prefrontal and premotor thalamus (Supplementary Fig. S2). 


### Intraoperative functional MRI 
  
The intra-OR fMRI experiment was performed during pulse generator implantation surgery, 1 week after the DBS lead implantation surgery (for detailed methods, see ( )). After general anesthesia induction, a unilateral (right side) DBS lead was externalized under sterile conditions and attached to a custom wire connected to an external pulse generator (DualScreen 3628, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) outside the sterile field. To minimize the effects of susceptibility artifacts produced by subgaleal connectors, the laterality (right in five participants) of the connected lead was selected such that it was contralateral to the implantable pulse generator ( ). Participants were then moved into the magnet bore and all scans were conducted with participants under general anesthesia ( ). Average head specific absorption rate (SAR) values of <0.1 W/kg were recorded during the fMRI study in all the participants, and a board-certified MRI physicist was present during all the sessions ( ). An anesthesia team was also present during all sessions and vital signs were continuously monitored. For all sequences, a manufacturer's standard transmit/receive RF head coil was used (1.5-T quadrature head coil, model 46-28211862; GE Healthcare, Maple Grove, MN). The fMRI was acquired using 2-dimensional gradient echo-echo planar imaging (GE-EPI): repetition time/echo time, 3000/50; flip angle, 90°; field of view, 22 × 22 cm; matrix, 64 × 64; slice thickness, 3.5 mm with a 0-mm gap thickness. For each acquisition, 135 volumes (the first five volumes were discarded for scanner equilibration) were acquired using a block paradigm, with five 6 s stimulation periods (two volumes) alternated with six 60 s rest periods (20 volumes), for a total time of 6 min 45 s per run. A total of 25 fMRI runs were collected, with each participant undergoing 4–6 runs of fMRI in a single session with 2 min of rest between each run. Four runs were consistent across all five participants. Bipolar thalamic HFS (90 μs width, 130 Hz, +3 V) was applied to the right DBS lead with the following contact configurations: 0–1+, 2–3+ with minimum of two repetitions for the same contact configuration. By convention, contact ‘0’ refers to the most ventrally-located contact on the quadripolar DBS lead, contact ‘3’ is the most dorsally-located. The cathode or current source is denoted by ‘−’, and ‘+’ refers to the passive/return contact. Following fMRI, participants were returned to the operating room for pulse generator implantation. 


### Tic score evaluation 
  
After three months of active bilateral DBS of the CMPf, four out of five participants (one declined to participate) underwent the Modified Rush Video Rating Scale (mRVRS) test that allows double-blinded objective tic assessments ( ;  ). Each participant was blinded as to the stimulation settings, and underwent programming to three settings in succession, in a randomized order (n = 12): sham DBS (off), dorsal contact DBS (bilateral; 2–3+; +3 V; 130 Hz; 90 μs), and ventral contact DBS (bilateral; 0–1+; +3 V; 130 Hz; 90 μs). During application of each stimulation setting, participants underwent 10 min of videotaping according to the mRVRS protocol. In brief, participants were placed in front of a video camera in a quiet room, and full frontal body (5 min) as well as close-up head and shoulder views (5 min) were recorded. Five domains were evaluated by a neurologist blinded to the conditions with subspecialty training in movement disorders: number of body areas involved with tics, motor tic intensity, vocal tic intensity, frequency of motor tics, and frequency of vocal tics. Reductions in mRVRS scores relative to sham stimulation (⊿mRVRS; positive values representing reductions in score) were evaluated by Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. 


### Functional MRI processing 
  
FMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using AFNI (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages;  ) software packages ( ). The T1 anatomical image was aligned to the fifth volume of the EPI time series by affine registration using a local Pearson correlation cost function ( ). The first four volumes of the time series were removed to ensure that all remaining volumes in the time-series were at magnetization steady state. Despiking and rigid body registration were used to estimate subject movement during EPI scans and to correct for slice acquisition timing ( ). In all participants, estimated displacement due to head motion was <0.5 mm in any given axis between successive time series volumes. The time series were then spatially transformed to the Talairach N27 brain template ( ) via affine transformation matrices estimated by registering T1-images to the N27 template. The spatially normalized EPI data were intensity scaled, and smoothed by a typical Gaussian blur of 4 mm full-width at half-maximum. At the individual session level, the general linear model estimated the shape of the hemodynamic response with respect to the timing of stimulation. To account for baseline drift and residual motion artifact, regressors included six motion parameters estimated during co-registration and a third-order baseline drift function. A regressor was created for the above-mentioned blocked stimulation paradigm, and convolved with a gamma-variate hemodynamic response function. Following the general linear model process, 25 beta-coefficient maps were obtained for the entire subject group. To obtain the stimulation-evoked activation map, a group-level linear mixed-effects model was conducted to adjust for within-subject activation baselines, age, DBS contact, and voltage effects ( ;  ;  ). To confirm cortical ROIs, brain surface maps were created by performing cortical parcellation ( ). 


### Correlation between stimulation-evoked BOLD signal and tic reduction 
  
For correlation analysis, regions of interest (ROIs) were defined from the group activation map threshold at a significance level of family-wise error (FWE)-corrected p < 0.05 (two-tailed; |t| > 2.15; cluster size > 840 cm ). Beta coefficients were extracted from individual activation maps, averaged within each ROI to determine Pearson correlations between ROI-averaged beta values and the ⊿mRVRS scores. In addition, individual voxels were identified that exhibited correlations between beta coefficient values and ⊿mRVRS scores. For this analysis, a Monte Carlo simulation indicated that an initial, voxel-wise threshold of FWE-corrected p < 0.05 was applied. As a final analysis, vocal and motor tic reduction scores were separated in the mRVRS score, and standard and partial correlation methods were applied to separate out the unique portions of variation in each measure that were associated with the BOLD signal changes. 



## Results 
  
### Thalamic HFS modulated brain areas that are relevant to tic generation 
  
Intra-OR fMRI during thalamic HFS showed both increased and decreased BOLD activation in BG-thalamic and cortical motor and limbic network areas. These regions mapped closely to major region of interest (ROI) identified in the NHP-TS model related to tic generation ( ; supplementary Fig. S1). Thalamic HFS resulted in significant (FWE-corrected p < 0.05) BOLD signal changes across a wide range of brain networks: 1) frontal, including prefrontal cortex (PFC) and medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the ACC, 2) motor, including sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum; 3) BG and thalamic regions; 4) limbic, including AM, NAc, insula, and temporal lobe, including the parahippocampal gyrus in the medial temporal lobe; and 5) parietal and occipital lobes ( A and  ).

Decreases in BOLD were also found in the medial frontal cortex, including Brodmann's area 8 (IL/RH), increases in BOLD in the inferior parietal cortex (CL/LH), which includes Wernicke's area, and a wide range of increased BOLD activation in the parietal and occipital lobes in both hemispheres.

Brain cortical surface maps confirmed thalamic HFS-induced increases in BOLD activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) that included the entire motor strip. Changes in BOLD, both increases and decreases, were observed in the PFC ipsilateral to the stimulation site in the right hemisphere (IL/RH), and decreases in BOLD in the ACC and OFC in both hemispheres. This included decreases in BOLD in the medial frontal cortex, as well as Brodmann's area 8 (IL/RH) that involves complex movement planning. In addition, increases in BOLD were also found in the inferior parietal cortex in the contralateral, left hemisphere (CL/LH), which included Wernicke's area. The surface map also confirmed a wide range of increases in BOLD activation in the parietal and occipital lobes in both hemispheres ( B). 


### Neural correlates of tic reduction by thalamic HFS 
  
Participants receiving thalamic HFS during clinical evaluation exhibited a significant reduction in tics (mean mRVRS score of 5.38 SEM ± 1.14) compared to participants receiving sham stimulation (mean mRVRS score of 7.25 SEM ± 1.98) (Wilcoxon signed rank test p < 0.05) ( A).   
Neural correlates of tic reduction by thalamic HFS. (A) Thalamic HFS resulted in lowering the mean mRVRS score (5.38 SEM ± 1.14) compared to no (sham) stimulation (mean mRVRS score of 7.25 SEM ± 1.98; p < 0.05). (B) In subcortical structures, thalamic HFS resulted in reductions in tics correlating with decreases in BOLD (negative correlations) in the PT and NAc (IL/RH), and (C) reductions in tics correlating with increases in BOLD (positive correlation) in the cerebellum spanning deep cerebellar nuclei and lobules IV and V (CL/LH). (D) In cortical structures, tic reduction positively correlated with BOLD signals in the frontal cortex, including PFC, ACC, OFC, sensorimotor cortex corresponding to the hand, arm, and shoulder areas (IL/RH), and a wide range of parietal and occipital lobe regions (IL/RH and CL/LH). In contrast, tic reduction negatively correlated with BOLD signals in the medial frontal cortex (Brodmann's area 8), and insula (IL/RH), and Wernicke's area (CL/LH). Abbreviations: ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; BA 8, Brodmann's area 8; NAc, nucleus accumbens; PT, putamen; OFC, orbitofrontal cortex; PFC, prefrontal cortex; BOLD, blood‑oxygen-level dependent; HFS, high frequency stimulation; mRVRS, modified Rush Video Rating Scale, CL/LH, contralateral to the stimulation site in the left hemisphere; IL/RH, ipsilateral to the stimulation site in the right hemisphere; LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere. 
  Fig. 2   

Reductions in mRVRS score during thalamic HFS relative to sham stimulation (⊿mRVRS; positive values representing reductions in score) were used to correlate with the change in fMRI BOLD signal during thalamic HFS (⊿BOLD). The voxel-level correlation map was overlaid onto the fMRI activation surface map ( BCD). Tic reduction correlated with a complex pattern of both increases and decreases in BOLD signals. Positive correlations represent reductions in tics correlating with increases in BOLD and negative correlations represent reductions in tics correlating with decreases in BOLD. In subcortical regions, negative correlations were found in the PT and NAc (IL/RH) ( B). Positive correlations were observed in the cerebellum spanning deep cerebellar nuclei and lobules IV and V (CL/LH) ( C). For cortical regions ( D), positive correlations were observed in the frontal cortex that include PFC, ACC, and OFC (IL/RH). The sensorimotor cortex corresponding to the hand, arm, and shoulder areas also showed a positive correlation (IL/RH). In addition, a wide range of parietal and occipital lobe regions showed positive correlations (IL/RH and CL/LH). In contrast, a negative correlation was seen in the medial frontal cortex containing Brodmann's area 8 and insula (IL/RH). Wernicke's area in the inferior parietal cortex also exhibited a negative correlation (CL/LH). Areas in the temporal lobe showed mixed effects of both positive and negative correlations (IL/RH). The gray matter and white matter voxel-level correlation surface maps and fMRI activation surface maps are shown for anatomical confirmation in supplementary Figs. S3 and S4. 

ROI-level correlation analysis was performed, as it would be less sensitive in spatial specificity compared to voxel-level analysis, but would have more representative values within the ROI ( , regions showing significant correlations in bold font). Consistent with voxel-level results, ACC, OFC, and occipital lobe showed positive correlations. ROI-level results revealed both positive and negative correlations in multiple temporal lobe regions (IL/RH and CL/LH), and positive correlations in the thalamus (IL/RH and CL/LH) and AM/NAc area (CL/LH). In contrast, ROI-level insula (IL/RH) showed a positive correlation inconsistent with voxel-level results (negative correlation). 


### Differential motor and limbic circuitry involvement in motor versus vocal tic production 
  
We have previously shown in the TS-NHP model that disinhibition of neural activity in the sensorimotor striatum (PT), via microinfusion of the GABA  antagonist bicuculline, induced motor tics in the orofacial region and/or the arm region, absence of vocal tics. In contrast, pharmacological disinhibition of the NAc (limbic) induced vocal tics that primarily expressed as repetitive grunts ( ). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) PET imaging revealed that activation in M1 and the cerebellum showed significantly greater activation during motor tic production than during vocal tic production (t > 5.47, corrected p < 0.05) (Fig. S1A). In contrast, the ACC, AM, and HP was significantly greater during vocal tic production than during motor tic production (t > 5.47, corrected p < 0.05) (Fig. S1B). Similarly, regional BOLD changes induced by thalamic HFS in the TS participants closely overlapped with the bicuculline-induced motor and vocal tic changes in regional rCBF in the NHP brain, where the brain areas of motor and vocal tic activity were affected by thalamic HFS (Fig. S1C). 


### Motor and vocal tic reduction by different circuit effects 
  
Differences in motor versus vocal tic reduction, as represented in the correlation map, were further investigated and found that there were distinct differences in the activation patterns. There was a negative correlation between motor tic reduction and BOLD signal in the sensorimotor cortex, insula, and BD 8 (IL/RH) ( A). In contrast, there was a negative correlation between vocal tic reduction and BOLD signal in the ACC in both hemispheres, and in the ipsilateral, right hemisphere's NAc and temporal lobe (IL/RH) ( B). Of note, these differential motor and vocal tic network effects are consistent with the NHP-TS results (Fig. S1ab). In the present study, both motor and vocal tic reductions had negative correlations with activation specific to the superior region of Wernicke's area in the inferior parietal cortex (CL/LH) ( AB). In addition, in the sensorimotor strip, vocal tic reduction correlated positively with BOLD generally covering the whole strip specifically including the face area, while motor tic reduction correlated negatively with BOLD only in the hand, arm, and shoulder areas. There were also a wide range of both positive and negative correlations among motor and vocal tic reduction and parietal and occipital lobe BOLD signal.

## Discussion 
  
The present results support the premise that TS is not simply due to a focal disorder in the brain, but rather the tic state is associated with large scale network abnormalities that are consistent across individuals with TS ( ) and supported by findings in animal models ( ,  ,  ). In addition, these same networks, both motor and limbic, are shown to be modulated by thalamic HFS in a symptom/network specific manner, and that these modulations strongly correlate with symptom improvement. 

The application of brain imaging techniques and surgical interventions in individuals with TS and basic investigations in animal models have provided data into understanding the pathophysiology of TS (for review see ( ;  ;  ). Some important insights have come from NHP studies which have demonstrated that TS-like behavioral symptoms are associated with discrete neural networks ( ;  ) and these behaviors are underlined by specific, abnormal firing patterns within the BGCTC. Metabolic and electrophysiological studies have identified dysrhythmia in the BGCTC network during evoked motor tics with notable local field potential spikes and temporal coding of single-unit activity in the BG, cerebellum, and M1 ( ,  ). Vocal tics evoked by bicuculline-induced disinhibition of the NAc correlated with wide brain increases in measured blood flow on rCBF PET imaging in the limbic network that involved the ACC, AM, and HP ( ), with similar activity being reported for limbic pallidal disinhibition in anesthetized NHPs ( ). Similar electrophysiological abnormalities have been shown in the local field potential recordings in cortical BG recipient regions of the NAc. Enhanced coupling between subcortical and cortical regions were also associated with phase-phase coupling, especially in alpha brain wave activity (7–12 Hz) ( ). 

The results from the present study add to a growing body of evidence that TS should be considered a disorder of large scale cortical and subcortical global networks ( ;  ). Traditionally TS was conceived as a focal disorder, relating to abnormal dopamine levels in the striatum, and subsequent dysregulation of action selection via indirect and direct pathways of the BG ( ). Notable recent studies have revealed distinct cortical motor network pathology, for example, thinning of sensorimotor cortex in children with TS relative to controls ( ), abnormally enhanced structural connectivity between sensorimotor cortex, thalamus, and striatum ( ), observations of reduced intracortical inhibition within the motor cortex ( ) and altered task-specific sensorimotor cortex activation ( ), which lends credence to the global network dysrhythmia hypothesis. 

While recent studies in rodents has demonstrated that interactions between the PT and motor cortex determine where (PT) and when (motor cortex) tics will occur ( ;  ), our results also support an extended network model and replicate previous findings showing significant activation/abnormality of the cerebellum during the production of tics ( ;  ;  ), and that the cerebellum is an integral part of the tic generating network. The cerebellum is known to have direct and indirect connections with the BG via intralaminar thalamic nuclei ( ). Therefore, it is possible that thalamic stimulation may directly activate the cerebellum or activate it indirectly through BG output and/or activation of cortico-cerebellar projections. 

Tic reduction correlated with reduced activation in the striatum ipsilateral to stimulation. This result, perhaps not surprising, given the pervasive striatal projections originating in thalamic CMPf, supports the premise that CMPf stimulation can modulate ongoing striatal activity ( ). Individuals with TS display reduced striatal interneuron density ( ;  ), and selective inhibition of striatal interneuron activity has been shown to lead to TS-like behavior in NHP ( ). Previous studies have shown that stimulation of the CMPf can induce excitatory, as well as inhibitory, responses in the striatum ( ). In addition, electrical activation of the CMPf has been shown to induce GABAergic inhibition of striatal acetylcholine release ( ). 

Since projections from the CMPf are topographically organized and span motor, limbic, and associative portions of the striatum, one might predict that stimulation would induce downstream effects on cortical areas in each of these categories. Previous neuroimaging studies have shown hyperactive metabolism in a range of motor, associative, and limbic regions in TS ( ;  ;  ). The present study suggests that many of these regions, which include premotor and sensorimotor cortex, insula, temporal lobe, cingulate, and somatosensory association areas, are modulated by thalamic stimulation ( ). In addition, there are hypotheses linking the insula, ACC, and PFC to TS mechanisms mediating premonitory urge ( ;  ). Indeed, insula, ACC, and PFC activation have been shown to be correlated to premonitory urges as assessed in subjects undergoing a blink suppression test ( ;  ;  ). While resting state fMRI studies on TS show increased connectivity in the insula and the sensorimotor cortex ( ), the present results also show that tic reduction highly correlates with the BOLD signal changes in those areas, especially with motor tics. Therefore, thalamic stimulation might act through the insula and sensorimotor cortices to affect the premonitory urge-related motor tic response. 

Some technical limitations must be considered for the results of this study. First, anesthesia may influence the DBS-evoked BOLD signal because patients received both inhaled halogenated ether anesthetic and intravenous fentanyl during fMRI acquisition. Second, the DBS electrode created a susceptibility artifact that reduced the strength of the BOLD signal along the electrode trajectory ( ). The artifact could lead to an underestimation of DBS-evoked BOLD in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes, which may have affected the results of our correlation analyses within that region. 


## Conclusion 
  
Overall, the present study shows that thalamic HFS in TS participants has wide-ranging effects that impact the frontostriatal, limbic, and motor networks. These findings suggest that thalamic HFS may suppress striatal output and reduce tic production via downstream effects in both the frontal and motor cortices. Furthermore, the present results suggest that the suppression of the motor and insula networks correlate with motor tic reduction, whereas suppression of frontal and parietal networks correlate with vocal tic reduction, implying it would be a critical factor to modulate both frontostriatal and motor networks for treatment of TS. Our study also provides unique translational information supporting the NHP-TS model. Future studies in clinical and preclinical research will be necessary to identify whether these network changes are cause or effect of TS symptoms.

# Abstract
 
The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated influences of language contexts on inhibitory control and the underlying neural processes. Thirty Cantonese–Mandarin–English trilingual speakers, who were highly proficient in Cantonese (L1) and Mandarin (L2), and moderately proficient in English (L3), performed a picture-naming task in three dual-language contexts (L1-L2, L2-L3, and L1-L3). After each of the three naming tasks, participants performed a flanker task, measuring contextual effects on the inhibitory control system. Behavioral results showed a typical flanker effect in the L2-L3 and L1-L3 condition, but not in the L1-L2 condition, which indicates contextual facilitation on inhibitory control performance by the L1-L2 context. Whole brain analysis of the fMRI data acquired during the flanker tasks showed more neural activations in the right prefrontal cortex and subcortical areas in the L2-L3 and L1-L3 condition on one hand as compared to the L1-L2 condition on the other hand, suggesting greater involvement of the cognitive control areas when participants were performing the flanker task in L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts. Effective connectivity analyses displayed a cortical-subcortical-cerebellar circuitry for inhibitory control in the trilinguals. However, contrary to the right-lateralized network in the L1-L2 condition, functional networks for inhibitory control in the L2-L3 and L1-L3 condition are less integrated and more left-lateralized. These findings provide a novel perspective for investigating the interaction between bilingualism (multilingualism) and inhibitory control by demonstrating instant behavioral effects and neural plasticity as a function of changes in global language contexts.

## Introduction 
  
Bilingualism is a form of “mental juggler” ( ), as speaking one language often involves simultaneous access to the non-target language in the brain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ). Therefore, for bilingual speakers, managing two languages requires constantly selecting words in the intended language and suppressing activations of the non-target language, a routine that necessitates the engagement of inhibitory control. As a result, the experience of using multiple languages might enhance bilinguals’ performance in non-linguistic domains. Previous studies have shown that bilinguals are less distracted, as compared to monolinguals, when performing inhibitory control tasks, including the Simon task ( ;  ), the Stroop task ( ), and the flanker task ( ). Moreover, interpreting training has been shown to improve inhibitory control processes ( ). 

The past decade has witnessed a dramatic increase in the use of neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural system of bilingual language control and the effects of second language acquisition on inhibitory control (e.g.,  ;  ;  ).   proposed a brain network for language control during bilingual speech production. The network includes the left prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), basal ganglia, and inferior parietal lobule.   hypothesis is that this neural network is dedicated to the selection and temporal sequencing of language representations during bilingual word production, and the pipeline works in the following order: The left basal-ganglia and ACC modulate the neural activity levels in the left prefrontal cortex, which influences neural activity in the inferior parietal cortex. Each of these areas has implications in distinct cognitive processes: The prefrontal cortex inhibits the non-target language and corrects errors; the ACC monitors conflicts and detects errors; the basal ganglia, especially the caudate nuclei, supervises the language selection and lexical access; the inferior parietal lobule, as a key region for working memory, serves a goal maintenance function.   further clarified distinct contributions of the left and right supramarginal gyri (SMG) in the inferior parietal lobules: The Left SMG is responsible for bias selection away from the language not in use; on the contrary, the right SMG is responsible for bias selection toward the language in use. This neural network for bilingual language control has been testified in a number of studies. In an fMRI study on German–Italian–English trilinguals,  , ) showed that language-switching directions influenced brain activation levels in the caudate nuclei, while activation levels of the supplementary motor area (SMA)/ACC did not vary as the function of language proficiency, which suggests a domain-general role for SMA/ACC in control tasks. Using meta-analysis approaches,   showed that 10 neuroimaging studies involving language switching reported significant and reliable neural responses in the following brain regions: The left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right precentral gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus (STG), midline pre-supplementary motor area, and bilateral caudate nuclei. Taken together, it is clear that the prefrontal cortex and caudate nuclei are highly involved in the regulation of bilingual speeches. These brain areas have also been reported in studies of non-linguistic cognitive tasks (e.g.,  ). However, how these areas are connected with one another as part of the control network remains unclear. 

Taking the advantage of the functional connectivity approach, researchers have attempted to identify the interactions between the language control network and the cognitive control network during L2 acquisition. For example,   in an L2 vocabulary training study showed that the language processing network and cognitive control network were highly integrated at the initial stage of vocabulary learning, but as the learning proceeded and the vocabularies are being consolidated, this integration decreased.   expanded this line of research. Instead of lab-based short-term vocabulary training, they studied neural adaptations in the development of L2 processing by examining a group of classroom Spanish L2 learners who were native English speakers over the course of one academic year. Their results show that with increased L2 experience, the overall activations in the control areas such as the ACC decreases while its connectivities with semantically related regions such as the MTG increases. The authors claim that the ability to utilize cognitive control mechanisms to regulate access to the L2 representations is a more critical issue in the beginning, relative to the latter stage, of L2 acquisition. Taken together, these studies suggest an important role of the cognitive control network in early L2 acquisition. 

One possibility is that the high demand and long-term practice of language control, which involves inhibitory control, during in L2 acquisition, that allows bilinguals outperforming monolinguals in several cognitive control tasks. However, participants’ background variables, such as socioeconomic status and ethnic origins ( ;  ;  ), also seem to matter for the cognitive advantage in bilinguals. It is also possible that language processing contexts account for some of the variances (e.g.,  ). Studies of neural plasticity on high temporal scales ( ;  ;  ) support the notion that different global language contexts (single or dual-language contexts) may lead to distinguished neural activation patterns during target word selection ( ).   proposed an adaptive control hypothesis: Language control processes adapt to the recurrent demands of the interactional context. For example, in a dual-language context, in which both languages are used (but to different speakers), language processing engages the control network comprising bilaterally inferior frontal and parietal cortices, the ACC/pre-SMA, basal ganglia, and thalamus ( ). In a dense code-switching context, however, speakers routinely interleave their languages in the course of a single utterance and adapt words from one of language in the context of the other language. The neural network of language control would rely more on a cerebellar-prefrontal connection as compared to the dual-language context because, in a dense code-switching context, language control involves higher demands for opportunistic planning ( ). 

Although the adaptive control hypothesis is a recent theory on the neural mechanisms of bilingual control, there has been increasing interest in the influence of language contexts on non-linguistic executive functions, such as inhibitory control. In a study using event-related potentials (ERPs),   examined effects of immediate changes in language processing contexts on executive function in a group of early Welsh–English bilinguals. The cognitive control performance of these participants was measured using a modified version of the classic flanker task, in which participants were instructed to press a button to indicate the direction of an arrow presented within an array of flankers (arrows pointing to the same or the opposite direction). Critically, a word is presented before the flanker trial to implicitly prime a language context. The contextual words were either in Welsh (L1), English (L2), or both languages in separated blocks. The results showed higher accuracy rates when bilingual participants performed incongruent trials of the flanker task in the dual-language context as compared to single-language contexts. The P300 amplitude was also reduced in the dual-language, as compared to the single-language context, indicating less flanker interference effect in the Welsh–English context. Therefore, the authors claimed that changes in language processing contexts could modulate non-linguistic cognitive control in bilinguals. 

In a further exploration,   examined the effect of language contexts on cognitive control in a group of Chinese–English bilinguals. Unlike the highly proficient Welsh–English bilinguals in  , participants in   were native speakers of Chinese who have a moderate level of proficiency in English. All participants performed an antisaccade task, which measures response inhibition (or response suppression), interference inhibition (or inhibitory control), and task switching, three key subcomponents of executive functions ( ). Response suppression refers to the ability to withhold an inappropriate response (e.g., triggered by a habitual cue), as is most classically established in the go/no-go paradigm. Inhibitory control refers to the process when multiple sources of information (e.g., the printing color and the word meaning in the classic Stroop paradigm) are competing for attention which needs to be drawn to the target attribute of the stimulus. Task switching refers to the ability to alter between two tasks that require different cognitive processes and responses. The critical difference between response suppression and inhibitory control is that the former taps onto the process of response execution, whereas the latter mainly measures the control of selective attention. In  , Chinese–English participants performed an antisaccade task in the pre-test and then complete a cued digit-naming task involving both Chinese and English. Following the naming task, the participants performed the same antisaccade task again in the post-test. The results showed that the bilingual naming task enhanced response suppression, impeded the inhibitory control, and made no influence on the performance of task switching. Therefore, the authors suggest that moderate proficient bilinguals may rely heavily on response suppression when making speech production in two languages. As a consequence, the bilingual naming task improved their performance in the antisaccade task. Meanwhile, because of the limited cognitive resources and more involvement of response suppression, inhibitory control might have been allocated with less cognitive resources when moderate proficient bilinguals name digits using alternating languages, explaining the decreased performance in inhibitory control. Task switching involves a different mechanism from response suppression and inhibitory control and was not influenced by the bilingual context. 

To reconcile discrepancies in previous studies, the present study explores the effect of language contexts on the neurocognitive mechanism of inhibitory control in a group of Cantonese–Mandarin–English trilinguals, who were highly proficient in Cantonese (L1)  and Mandarin (L2), and moderate proficient in English (L3). One possibility is that the discrepancies between   and   are not necessarily contradictory; they might arise as a result of differences in the participants’ language background. The Welsh-English bilingual participants in   were highly proficient in both languages; in contrast, the Chinese–English bilinguals in   were intermediate learners of English. Bilinguals with high and low levels of L2 proficiency might adopt different processing strategies during speech production and, therefore, have incomparable implications for executive functions. In the same vein, age of L2 acquisition could also explain discrepancies between the two studies. Early and late bilinguals might engage different cognitive and neural mechanisms during language processing, so that the effect of language context on executive control might not be comparable between the two types of bilinguals. Finally, it is worth noting that unlike Chinese and English, Welsh and English are both alphabetical languages. Switching between two languages with more similarities in linguistic structures might engage different executive components as compared to switching between two languages that differ more radically. 

To verify that language contexts may exert different effects on the inhibitory control of bilinguals with different language backgrounds, the present study examined trilingual speakers while they performed a flanker task ( ) following picture naming in different dual-language contexts: the L1-L2 context, the L2-L3 context, and the L1-L3 context. Within-subject comparisons of their performance in the flanker task following the three contexts will provide a more confident answer to the modulation effect of language context on inhibitory control. It is our hypothesis that in the L1-L2 context (Cantonese–Mandarin), as in  , bilingual context would facilitate inhibitory control performance; in the L2-L3 (Mandarin–English) and the L1-L3 (Cantonese–English) contexts, as in  , the bilingual context would have no beneficial effect on inhibitory control. 

The second goal of the current study is to examine how dual-language contexts modulate the functional brain network for inhibitory control, which is usually right-lateralized. For this purpose, effective connectivity analyses, following a recently developed procedure for valid group modeling, namely Group Interactive Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME,  ) was performed to identify causal relationships between key brain regions that subserve inhibitory control in different dual-language contexts. If dual-language contexts do not influence inhibitory control process, participants should display a typical flanker effect and comparable brain activation patterns as well as common functional brain network when performing the flanker task. If dual-language contexts do modulates inhibitory control, it is our hypothesis that the L1-L2 context would elicit a right-lateralized network for inhibitory control, while the L1-L3 and L2-L3 contexts might engage a less typical inhibitory control network, because of the more demanding task on linguistic processing and language control in the L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts, relative to the L1-L2 context. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Thirty students (10 males; age range 18–25) were recruited from the Guangdong University of Foreign Studies in Guangzhou, a city with a large Cantonese–Mandarin bilingual community. All participants were highly proficient early bilinguals of Cantonese (first language, L1) and Mandarin (second language, L2): They were raised up in a Cantonese family and have acquired Mandarin since early childhood. At the time of testing, participants use both languages on a regular basis. 

All participants were late learners of English (third language, L3) in the mainstream classroom and had a moderate level of proficiency. They started to learn English at an average age of 7.4 (±1.82). According to their self-report, English and Mandarin were used as the main instruction languages in their English class (English usage: 52% ± 0.22; Mandarin usage: 40% ± 0.2; Cantonese usage: 7% ± 0.11), implying considerable experiences of switching and translation between English and Mandarin as a result of English learning. 

As shown in   Table   , to assess the participants’ linguistic knowledge and background variables in each of their three languages, we asked them to complete the following measures: (1) responses to the Language History Questionnaire (LHQ 2.0;  ) including the age of language acquisition (AoA), usage habits, switching frequency, and language abilities, (2) vocabulary knowledge in each language as examined through naming accuracy rates in a picture naming task (48 out of the 96 high-frequency non-living objects were selected as the stimuli from the battery of   and matched between languages, and (3) the   as measurements of their English proficiency. 
  
Demographic variables, measures of cognitive skills, and language background information of the Cantonese–Mandarin–English trilingual participants. 
    
Based on language experience, usage habits, and language proficiency, the participants in the current study were characterized as (1) highly proficient in Cantonese and Mandarin, and with extensive experiences of switching between the two languages during conversations (i.e., in the L1-L2 context), and (2) moderately proficient in English but with more Mandarin–English switching experience (i.e., in the L2-L3 context) than Cantonese–English switching experience (i.e., in the L1-L3 context). All participants were right-handed as measured by the handedness inventory ( ). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment. The Human Research Ethics Committee for Non-Clinical Faculties at the School of Psychology of South China Normal University approved this study. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 


### Materials and Procedure 
  
#### Cognitive Assessments 
  
Before the fMRI session, all participants received a battery of behavioral tests that are designed to measure their non-verbal intelligence (the Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices;  ) and working memory (the odd-even sequencing task, an adaptation of number-sequencing subtest form the WAIS-III;  ) as shown in   Table   . 


#### fMRI Procedure 
  
Participants completed six event-related fMRI runs, each lasting 6 min and 36 s. As shown in   Figure   , every picture-naming run was presented prior to a flanker run. The order of the three dual-language contexts (i.e., L1-L2, L2-L3, and L1-L3) was counterbalanced between participants in a Latin square design. 
  
Experiment paradigm   (A)   and fMRI scanning sequence   (B)  . 
  
The Picture Naming Task: As shown in   Figure   , picture-naming tasks in the three dual-language contexts followed the same paradigm, each involving two different languages. During the picture-naming task, participants named pictures in two languages alternatingly, with 24 pictures per language. The stimuli were randomly selected from 96 black and white drawings for concrete non-living objects (e.g., piano) in the UCSD International Picture Naming Project (IPNP) picture database  ( ). All stimuli corresponded to high frequency words in both Chinese ( ) and English ( ), and were matched for word frequency (  t   = 0.4,   p   = 0.69) between the two languages. To ensure the familiarity of the object names, we asked an independent group of 35 individuals (age range: 18–21) from the same population to rate the familiarity of the object names on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very infrequent; 5 = very frequent). There were no significant differences between the levels of familiarities of object names in the three languages [L1 = 4.0 ± 0.62, L2 = 4.13 ± 0.71, L3 = 3.94 ± 0.74;   F   = 2.65,   p  s > 0.05]. 

In each trial of the picture naming task, a frame was presented for 500 ms and then a picture of an object appeared in the center of the frame for 3000 ms, followed by a blank screen of 500 ms. The color of the frame (blue, red, and green) served as the naming cue (blue for Cantonese, red for Mandarin, and green for English). Participants were instructed to covertly name the picture in the target language within 3000 ms. The 48 picture-naming trials were presented in a pseudo-random order with a jittered inter-stimulus interval (min = 2000 ms, max = 12000 ms) optimized with OptSeq2 ( ).  During the inter-trial interval, a central fixation cross was presented. Due to equipment limitation and to minimize head movements during naming, naming responses were collected outside of the MRI scanner. As an orientation procedure, we informed participants that they would later complete a behavioral test related to the naming task inside the scanner. We collected behavioral data with the same task outside of the scanner 2 weeks after the fMRI sessions (e.g.,  ;  ). 

The Flanker Task: Immediately following each picture-naming task, participants were scanned in a flanker task session, to examine the influence of language context on their inhibitory control process. During the flanker task ( ), participants responded to the direction of a red chevron (i.e., the target) surrounded by other black chevrons (i.e., the flankers). As shown in   Figure   , in congruent trials, flanker chevrons point in the same direction as the target, whereas in incongruent trials, flankers pointed in the opposite direction to the target. Twenty-four congruent trials and 24 incongruent trials were randomly presented during each flanker task scanning session, with jittered inter-stimulus intervals (min = 2000 ms, max = 12000 ms). Each trial began with the presentation of a red fixation for 500 ms, followed by the stimulus for 3000 ms, and then a blank buffer of 500 ms. 



### MRI Acquisition 
  
MRI images were acquired on a 3-T scanner (Siemens Trio Tim) equipped with a 12-channel phased-array head coil at the South China Normal University, using a T2 -weighted gradient-echo EPI sequence (TE = 30 ms; TR = 2s; flip angle = 90°; slices = 32; matrix size = 64 × 64; FoV = 192 mm × 192 mm; thickness = 4 mm). Participants lay supine in the scanner and viewed the visual stimuli via a back-projection mirror, while their heads were immobilized with cushions. For each run, the functional scanning was always preceded by 6 s of dummy scans (fixation) to ensure tissue steady-state magnetization. High-resolution (1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm) anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted, 3D inversion-recovery gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence. 


### Data Analyses 
  
#### Whole Brain Activations 
  
The fMRI data were preprocessed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software running under MATLAB (SPM12; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London).  All three flanker runs followed the same data processing procedure. The first three scans (dummy scans) of the 198 volumes collected were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration. The remaining 195 volumes were then realigned to the first volume for head-motion correction, co-registered to the individual anatomical images and then to the EPI template in SPM12 based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic space, and resampled into 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm cubic voxels. The head motion and rotation of all participants were less than 3 mm of displacement or 3° of rotation. 

For each participant, functional images collected from each flanker run were grouped into congruent and incongruent conditions. Individual brain activations corresponding to congruent or incongruent conditions (in contrast to fixation) were analyzed using general linear model (GLM) and were entered into the second level of group analysis to show the neural correlates underlying inhibitory control. 

AlphaSim program in the REST ( ) software was used to correct for multiple comparisons in SPM (10,000 interactions). All the brain activations reported below survived an FWE-corrected cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05 (single voxel:   p   < 0.001, number of voxels > 12) ( ) and were in the MNI coordinate space. 


#### ROI Selection and Analysis 
  
Based on previous fMRI literature on language control and inhibitory control ( ;  ;  ;  ), we selected 12 regions of interest (ROIs) to compose a cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network, which includes the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (33, 36, 21), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (48, 9, 21), bilateral insula (INS) (±36, 3, -3), bilateral supramarginal gyri (SMG) (±18, 0, 21), bilateral caudate nuclei (CN) (±18, -21, 24), bilateral thalamus (THA) (±21, -30, 3), and bilateral cerebellum (CERE) (±15, -69, 42). Averaged time course data of all the voxels within a sphere (6 mm radius) in each ROI were extracted using the DPBABI software ( ) . 

To identify activation changes in those regions between congruent and incongruent conditions following the three different dual-language contexts, the present study sorted time series of the 12 ROIs by experimental conditions (e.g., congruent and incongruent). The averaged time course signals across all trials of the congruent/incongruent conditions were converted to percentage signal changes (PSC) using the formula (signal-baseline)/baseline × 100 for each time point, and the baseline constant was the mean signal of the fixation baseline (e.g.,  ). The averaged PSC values for each condition in every context were considered as representative activation level of each ROI for every participant. 


#### Effective Connectivity 
  
To examine the influence of dual-language context on functional brain connectivity of inhibitory control process in the trilinguals, we made use of recent advances in connectivity modeling (extended unified structural equation modeling, euSEM) ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ) and a recently developed Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME), an automatic and freely distributed MATLAB-based program . 

The euSEM approach has provided a flexible and efficient method for analyzing the causal interactions of brain regions for cognitive functions, as has previously been applied in   and  . The procedure for using the euSEM in the current study is consistent with  , but with two experimental conditions in every language context, namely congruent and incongruent conditions of the flanker task. As with other SEM-based approaches, GIMME works from individual-level correlation matrices. The covariance matrices used for the euSEM analysis include the ROI time series at time t (contemporaneous series, where each “t” is a single brain volume or TR) and the same ROI time series at the next time t + 1 (lagged series). For the euSEM analysis, the covariance matrices also include two time series of the effects of the task inputs (congruent and incongruent) for both time t and t + 1, convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. In addition, the bilinear series can be used to measure the influence of task inputs on the relationship between ROIs by examining time series of each ROI at each time t multiplied by the convolved task input series at time t. The model selections at the group and individual levels are implemented in the following steps. First, Lagrange Multiplier equivalents (i.e., modification indices;  ) are used to identify which effects (including connections among ROIs, the direct and bilinear effects), if freed, optimally improve model fit   across all individuals.   The probability of detecting an effect across all individuals was set at 75%; selection of this criterion was informed by empirical and simulated studies on the likelihood of detecting a true effect should it exist in a given sample (e.g.,  ,  ;  ;  ;  ). The program iterates until the 75% criterion is met. Second, the model is pruned by eliminating connections that are no longer significant for 75% of the group after other connections are freed. Third, individual-level models are estimated in a semi-confirmatory manner. All connections freed in the group model (described in the two steps above) are freed at the individual level. The automatic search procedure within LISREL ( ) then iteratively frees connections that optimally improve model fit, according to the Lagrange Multiplier equivalents ( ). Finally, the model is pruned by eliminating individual-level connections that become non-significant after other individual-level connections are freed, and a confirmatory model is fitted. Model fit parameters, that were found to demonstrate reliability in simulation studies (e.g.,  ) and fMRI studies (e.g.,  ), were chosen   a priori   so that two of the following four criteria were satisfied in the final model: confirmatory fit index (CFI) ≥ 0.9; non-normed fit index (NNFI) ≥ 0.9. 




## Results 
  
### Behavioral Results 
  
As shown in   Figure   , participants performed more quickly in the congruent condition as compared to the incongruent condition, displaying a typical flanker interference effect ( ) in all three dual-language contexts (  p  s < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in response times between the congruent or incongruent trials following the three dual-language contexts (  p  s > 0.05). 
  
Reaction times (bars; left axis) and accuracy rates (lines; right axis) in the flanker task for the Cantonese-Mandarin-English trilinguals in the L1-L2, L2-L3, and L1-L3 contexts. Reaction times for the congruent condition (C) and incongruent condition (I) were significantly different in the three contexts. For accuracy rate, there was no significant difference between congruent and incongruent conditions when the flanker task was presented in the L1-L2 context. The asterisks indicate significant differences (  p   < 0.001;   p   < 0.05). Error bars depict SEM in reaction time data. 
  
For accuracy rates, the flanker interference effect (higher accuracy rates in the congruent as compared to the incongruent trials) was found following the L2-L3 context (two-sample   t  -test,   t   = 2.27,   p   < 0.05) and the L1-L3 context (  t   = 2.32,   p   < 0.05), but not the L1-L2 context (two-sample   t  -test,   t   = 1.14,   p   = 0.26), suggesting a facilitation effect of the L1-L2 context on inhibitory control process. 


### fMRI Results 
  
#### Whole-Brain Analysis 
  
As shown in   Table   , in the L1-L2 context, incongruent trials elicited additional brain activations in the left inferior parietal lobe. In the L2-L3 context, incongruent conditions involved extra neural responses in the right inferior frontal gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus. In the L1-L3 context, both congruent and incongruent trials evoked neural activities in the right prefrontal cortex, right insula, and subcortical areas. See Supplementary Figure   for brain activations during the naming tasks. 
  
Whole brain activations associated with the flanker conditions for the Cantonese–Mandarin–English trilinguals in the L1-L2, L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts. 
  
No significant differences of neural activations were found between congruent and incongruent conditions in the L1-L2 and L2-L3 contexts. In the L1-L3 context, incongruent condition, as compared to the congruent condition, showed more neural responses in the bilateral inferior occipital gyri (Brodmann area 19, or BA 19), right middle occipital gyrus and bilateral middle temporal gyri (MTG). It is well-known that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is the hub for declarative memory and keeps semantic representation ( ). MTG might be a multimodal semantic processing hub, storing long-term conceptual knowledge, processing lexico-semantic information, and fulfilling semantic integration, especially in the L2 lexical processing ( ). The stronger activation of the bilateral MTG in incongruent trials following L1-L3 context might imply competition of cognitive resources between inhibitory control task and the demanding semantic processing in L1-L3 context. As illustrated in   Figure   , dual-language contexts (i.e., the L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts) involving a moderate proficient language (L3) displayed increased brain activity in the right prefrontal cortex, bilateral insula and inferior parietal lobules, as well as subcortical areas, particularly the bilateral caudate and putamen, as compared to the L1-L2 context.

#### ROI Analyses 
  
The following 12 ROIs were chosen based on the extant imaging literature of inhibitory control and language control (see ROI Selection in the Section of Materials and Methods): The right MFG, right IFG, bilateral INS, SMG, CN, Thalamus (THA), as well as bilateral cerebellum (CERE). Our analyses of the percent BOLD signal changes in those ROIs found (1) significant flanker effects in all the three dual-language contexts in the right cerebellum [right CERE,   F   = 15.56,   p   < 0.001]; (2) brain activations in the right IFG and left cerebellum were associated with the flanker effect in the L2-L3 context [right IFG,   F   = 5.65,   p   = 0.024; left CERE,   F   = 6.19,   p   = 0.019]; (3) neural responses in the right cerebellum, right MFG, right IFG, and left INS were associated with the flanker effect only in the L1-L3 context [MFG,   F   = 7.09,   p   = 0.013; IFG,   F   = 58.75,   p   = 0.006; INS,   F   = 4.37,   p   = 0.045] (  Figure   ). 


#### Connectivity Analysis 
  
An extended unified Structural Equation Model (euSEM) analysis was conducted on the fMRI data of the flanker tasks following the L1-L2, L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts. All group maps (  Figure   ) had an excellent fit to the data for roughly 97–100% of the participants, depending on the measure ( ). Specifically, in the L1-L2 context, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) evaluated the model fit as excellent for 100% of the participants’ data, while Standardized ROOT Mean Square Residual (SRMR) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) showed excellent fit for 97% of the data. In L2-L3 context, CFI, SRMR and the RMSEA results indicated an excellent fit for 100% of the data, as is the same in the L1-L3 context. 
  
Connectivity maps for inhibitory control process in three dual-language contexts (L1-L2; L2-L3; L1-L3). Significant contemporaneous and lagged relationships at group-level were shown, and auto-regressive lagged connections are omitted for clarity. Connection strength is denoted by beta coefficients, reflected here as the color the line. The solid line indicates contemporaneous relationship, namely area X at time T influences brain activation of area Y at time T; dotted line illustrates lagged relationship, namely area X at time T influences brain activation of area Y at time T + 1. Nodes (ROIs) are MFG, middle frontal gyrus; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; INS, insula; CN, caudate nucleus; THA, thalamus; SMG, supramarginal gyrus; CERE, cerebellum; R, right hemisphere. 
  
As shown in   Figure   , the cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network for inhibitory control following the three dual-language contexts shared common connections: The right INS and thalamus strongly influence their left homologous areas, implying the right-dominant network for inhibitory control; the right IFG feeds to the right MFG, suggesting that the right IFG is highly engaged in bottom–up process of inhibitory control; the right thalamus influences brain activations in the right caudate in a lagged relationship, implying the key role of right thalamus in the communications between cortical and subcortical areas. In all the three contexts, right INS influences right IFG and left SMG. Not surprisingly, the left and right SMG are connected to each other as for the bilateral caudate nuclei. 

Obviously, in all three dual-language contexts, inhibitory control relied on collaborations between a frontal-parietal network, a cortical-thalamic-striato pathway and bilateral cerebellum. However, dual-language contexts influence inhibitory control network in the trilinguals. To be specific, inhibitory control in the L1-L2 context recruits an efficient and right lateralized network: The right INS as the hub of the network feeds to the right IFG, modulating brain activation in the right MFG indirectly and activating the right SMG; the right THA, as a mediator of frontal-thalamic-striato pathway, receiving positive information from the right INS, feeds to the right CN; right THA is also a key relay station for cortico-cerebellar pathway, forwarding information from the right INS to the left cerebellum, which sends strong and positive influence to the right cerebellum; right SMG forward information from the right IFG to the left SMG, which passes information to the right insula, completing the frontal-parietal sub-network. 

When the dual-language context involves a moderate proficient language (L3), the functional brain network for inhibitory control in the same group of participants changed immediately. Specifically, in the L2-L3 context, the frontal-parietal sub-network runs in the reverse pipeline: The right IFG actively influences the right INS, which as a hub sends direct and positive information to the left SMG, feeding directly to the right SMG; the right IFG receives feedback from the right SMG and connects to the right MFG. As in the L1-L2 context, right INS influences bilateral caudate via THA in a lagged relationship. The left cerebellum receives inputs directly from the right SMG and feeds to the right cerebellum. Interestingly, the right CN activates left CN in the L2-L3 context, as is the same in the condition of the L1-L3 context. 

L1-L3 context involves a moderate proficient language and engages less switching experience between the two languages. Compared with the L1-L2 and L2-L3 contexts, inhibition control in the L1-L3 context relies on a more left-lateralized and less integrated network, compared with the networks in the other two dual-language contexts. In L1-L3 context, the left SMG works as the hub of the inhibitory control network: The right MFG takes the lead and sends orders directly to the left SMG, which relays to the right INS, right SMG, right THA, and right cerebellum. The right THA, as in the other two conditions, forward positive information to the right CN in a lagged relationship, thus completing the cortico-thalamic-striato pathway. For the cerebellar components, the right cerebellum receives weak influence from SMG on the contralateral side and feeds to the left cerebellum. 

Taken together, the cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network for inhibitory control involves a frontal-parietal sub-network, cortico-thalamic-striato pathway, and bilateral cerebellum. However, this neural pattern can be modulated by language contexts on a short timescale. In dual-language contexts with intensive code switching between two proficient languages (i.e., the L1-L2 context), the inhibitory control process seems to be facilitated and rely on a right-lateralized control network. When the dual-language context involves a less proficient language, especially when the two languages are radically different from each other, the inhibitory control process relies on a more left-lateralized and less integrated neural network: In the L2-L3 context, the right IFG feeds to right INS and receives feedback from the right SMG; in the L1-L3 context, the right MFG is highly engaged and the whole network relies on the left SMG to modulate brain activations in the cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar areas. 




## Discussion 
  
The current study examines the dynamic influences of language contexts on inhibitory control in trilinguals. We explored the neural correlates and functional brain networks activated while Cantonese–Mandarin–English trilingual speakers performed the flanker tasks in three dual-language contexts. As bilingual language processing engages inhibition of the non-target language ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and acquiring a second language facilitates the development of cognitive control ( ;  ;  ), we expected a facilitatory effect of dual-language contexts on participants’ cognitive control performance (e.g.,  ). Our participants were highly proficient in L1 and L2, but moderately proficient in L3. They frequently switch between L1 and L2 in everyday life, but not between L1 and L3 or L2 and L3. We, therefore, expected to observe significant facilitatory effect of the L1-L2 context as compared to the L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts on inhibitory control. 

The results showed the classic flanker effect in the L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts, but not in the L1-L2 context. Consistent with results in a previous study ( ), the effect of contextual priming was observed in accuracy rates but not reaction times, suggesting that independent cognitive mechanisms might account for flanker effects in the two types of measurements. Previous studies (e.g.,  ) using a similar flanker task showed that in the incongruent condition, bilinguals activated a widespread set of brain regions, including the fusiform gyri, inferior frontal gyri, supplementary motor area, inferior parietal regions, and subcortical areas. In the present study, those brain regions for inhibitory control failed to show significant activations in incongruent condition (when compared to the congruent condition) in the L1-L2 context. Moreover, none of the ROIs showed significant interference effects in the L1-L2 context in terms of their BOLD signal change (  Figure   ). These findings suggest that the neural efficiency of the inhibitory control network was enhanced in the L1-L2 context, reducing the classic flanker effect in both the behavioral and the neural anatomical level (e.g.,  ;  ). Effective connectivity analysis shows the following pattern of results: The right insula functions as the hub of the frontal-parietal network, feeding to the right IFG, which mediates the right MFG and bilateral SMG; the right MFG and bilateral SMG then send information to the right THA, which positively modulates brain activations of bilateral caudate nuclei in a lagged relationship and directly influences the cerebellar pathway. The important role of the right insula in inhibitory control has been well documented. In an event-related fMRI study,   showed that performing a response inhibition task activated the right hemisphere, including the right MFG, IFG, insula, and inferior parietal lobule. A more recent study dissociated the functional role of the right IFG and insula in inhibitory control and suggests that the right insula is particularly important for detecting behaviorally salient events, while the right IFG is more involved in implementing inhibitory control ( ). Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that the right frontal-insular cortex has been implicated in switching between central-executive and default-mode networks ( ). 

In the L2-L3 context, behavioral results showed significant flanker effects in both reaction times and accuracy rates (see   Figure   ). Analysis of the neuroimaging data showed that the flanker effect was associated with brain activations in the right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral insula, left rolandic operculum, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, and right thalamus. This pattern of activations is highly consistent with neural mechanisms underlying typical flanker effects (e.g.,  ). ROI analyses showed that the flanker effect was associated with activations in the right IFG and left cerebellum, where no such significant activations were found in the L1-L2 context, suggesting a priming effect on the inhibitory control when the dual-language context involves two highly proficient languages. Connectivity map shows a similar frontal-parietal network, but in the reverse relationship. To be specific, in the L1-L2 context, the right IFG sends feedback to the right MFG and completes the frontal-parietal circuitry via the right SMG and left SMG; in the L2-L3 context, flanker task involves more engagement of the IFG: The IFG passes positive influences to the right INS, forwarding information to the left SMG and the right THA; the right SMG receives signals from the left SMG and sends feedback to the IFG, completing the frontal-parietal loop. 

In the L1-L3 context, the flanker effect is associated with a different neural network, in which the left SMG is the hub. As illustrated in   Figure   , the right MFG influences the left SMG, which influences the right INS, the right IFG, and finally the right MFG, completing a frontal-insula-parietal network without the right SMG; meanwhile, the left SMG directly modulates brain activations in the right THA, which communicates with the right CN in a lagged relationship as in the other two contexts; furthermore, the left SMG feeds to the right cerebellum, which connects to the left cerebellum. This distinction of the neural network in the L1-L3 context, as compared to the L1-L2 and the L2-L3 contexts, is further supplemented by increased activations in the right MFG, right IFG, bilateral basal ganglia and cerebellum (see   Table   ). ROI analyses also showed that activations in the right MFG and right cerebellum were associated with the flanker effect. 

Research in neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience has established the role of the left supramarginal gyrus in the inferior parietal lobule in second language acquisition. Neuroimaging data showed that early bilingualism is associated with increased gray matter density in the left inferior parietal lobe ( ). In addition, researchers have found that the lateral inferior parietal cortex contributes to attentional focalization and target detection in both auditory and visual modalities, indicating its involvement in domain-general attentional processes (e.g.,  ;  ). As summarized by  , second language acquisition might tune this attentional control area into a “multilingual talent area” as phonological storage and attentional control functions were also subserved by this left inferior parietal lobe. The right SMG, as suggested by  , was particularly involved in language selection in conversations that involve multiple languages. As illustrated in   Figure   , in the L1-L2 context, the right SMG is influenced by the right IFG in a top-down control process, while in the L2-L3 context, it sends feedback to the right IFG, forming a bottom–up stream. 

It is worth noticing that in the L1-L2 context, consistent with the adaptive control hypothesis ( ), the right IFG feeds to the right insula, which influences the right thalamus, thus modulating subcortical areas such as the caudate and connecting the cerebellum. The thalamus has been reported to directly connect to the regions of basal ganglia ( ) and has reciprocal structure connections with the cerebellum as a relay station (e.g.,  ). The left caudate and putamen might be more involved in verb interference effects ( ;  ), while the right homologous areas play a more important role in inhibitory control. Based on our results of trilinguals, dual-language contexts modulate the involvement of inhibitory control areas and their interactions. 


## Conclusion 
  
The finding that dual-language contexts lead to functional reorganizations of the inhibitory control network not only reconciles discrepancies in previous studies (e.g.,  ;  ), but also provides a novel perspective for investigating the interplay between language control and non-linguistic cognitive processes. To fully understand the nature of the neural mechanisms subserving non-linguistic skills (e.g., executive functions), researchers have to consider the influences of processing contexts. Results of the current study provides empirical evidence in favor of the adaptive control hypothesis ( ), which suggests that interactional contexts (e.g., single-language, dual-language, or frequent-switching) modulate language control processes by adaptive changes in the neural regions and circuits associated with specific control processes. Critically, our results showed that the cognitive system and its underlying neural network are highly plastic, allowing quick development of functional reconfigurations. Short-term language engagement, in the form of contextual priming, can instantly rewire the related brain mechanisms. This finding sheds new light on therapy training programs for individuals with minor cognitive impairment (MCI). Whether or not L2 proficiency, age of acquisition, and cross-language similarities (e.g., alphabetical or non-alphabetical) distinctly contribute to the modulation effects of bilingual contexts requires further exploration.

# Abstract
 
Separable visual attention functions are assumed to rely on distinct but interacting neural mechanisms. Bundesen's “theory of visual attention” (TVA) allows the mathematical estimation of independent parameters that characterize individuals' visual attentional capacity (i.e., visual processing speed and visual short-term memory storage capacity) and selectivity functions (i.e., top-down control and spatial laterality). However, it is unclear whether these parameters distinctively map onto different brain networks obtained from intrinsic functional connectivity, which organizes slowly fluctuating ongoing brain activity. In our study, 31 demographically homogeneous healthy young participants performed whole- and partial-report tasks and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Report accuracy was modeled using TVA to estimate, individually, the four TVA parameters. Networks encompassing cortical areas relevant for visual attention were derived from independent component analysis of rs-fMRI data: visual, executive control, right and left frontoparietal, and ventral and dorsal attention networks. Two TVA parameters were mapped on particular functional networks. First, participants with higher (vs. lower) visual processing speed showed lower functional connectivity within the ventral attention network. Second, participants with more (vs. less) efficient top-down control showed higher functional connectivity within the dorsal attention network and lower functional connectivity within the visual network. Additionally, higher performance was associated with higher functional connectivity between networks: specifically, between the ventral attention and right frontoparietal networks for visual processing speed, and between the visual and executive control networks for top-down control. The higher inter-network functional connectivity was related to lower intra-network connectivity. These results demonstrate that separable visual attention parameters that are assumed to constitute relatively stable traits correspond distinctly to the functional connectivity both within and between particular functional networks. This implies that individual differences in basic attention functions are represented by differences in the coherence of slowly fluctuating brain activity.

## Introduction 
  
Separable visual attention functions are assumed to rely on distinct but interacting neural mechanisms (Posner and Petersen,  ; Desimone and Duncan,  ; Bundesen et al.,  ). The computational “theory of visual attention” (TVA, Bundesen,  ) permits a set of independent parameters to be estimated that reflect individuals' attentional capacity (i.e., visual processing speed and short-term memory storage capacity) and selectivity (i.e., top-down control and spatial laterality). These TVA parameters have been suggested to constitute traits that characterize individuals' speed and efficiency of attentional selection processes (Finke et al.,  ). The relationship between these parameters and the basic organization of the brain has mainly been examined in local lesion studies. Thus, for example, reduced visual processing speed has been associated with temporoparietal junction (Peers et al.,  ) and lateral thalamic non-traumatic lesions (Kraft et al.,  ), as well as with a parietal white-matter reduction in posterior cortical atrophy (Neitzel et al.,  ). A lateral spatial bias has been documented following medial thalamic lesions (Kraft et al.,  ) as well as asymmetric parietal hypometabolism induced by early Alzheimer's disease (Sorg et al.,  ). Studies on the neural organization of these parameters in the healthy brain are comparatively rare. A structural connectivity analysis revealed visual short-term memory (VSTM) capacity to be associated with the organization of the superior longitudinal and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (Chechlacz et al.,  ). Top-down control was found to be associated with task-related functional connectivity among parietal areas (Vossel et al.,  ). Taken together, these findings imply that TVA parameters closely reflect the integrity of attention-relevant brain areas and their connections, including their functional interactions. It remains, however, unknown whether and how these parameters map onto functional networks overlapping those attention-relevant areas. 

Functional networks that include regions relevant for visual attention have been identified based on their intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) (Fox et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ; Yeo et al.,  ; Raichle,  ). Intrinsic FC represents the correlation, among different brain regions, of infra-slowly (i.e., 0.01–0.1 Hz) ongoing blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal intensity fluctuations obtained from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Fox and Raichle,  ; Raichle,  ). Such fluctuations reflect the dynamics of slowly propagating activity including cortical neuronal excitability (Wu et al.,  ; Matsui et al.,  ), linked with faster oscillatory activity by cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling (Mantini et al.,  ; He et al.,  ; Brookes et al.,  ; Hipp et al.,  ). Intrinsic FC provides relevant information on both brain-evoked activity (Mennes et al.,  ) and behavior (Markett et al.,  ; Rosenberg et al.,  ,  ). Crucially, the brain networks identified through intrinsic FC are stable both within (Zuo et al.,  ) and across subjects (Damoiseaux et al.,  ; De Luca et al.,  ), and largely correspond to structural connectivity (Damoiseaux and Greicius,  ; Honey et al.,  ). These characteristics collectively suggest the possibility of a distinctive correspondence between specific, separable visual attention functions and particular intrinsic brain networks. 

Here we examined whether and how independent visual attention parameters obtained from modeling using TVA are mapped onto distinct functional networks derived from intrinsic FC. Crucially, to avoid potential confounding by structural integrity or visual attention changes inherent in patient or developing populations, we examined an age-homogeneous group of healthy participants. Moreover, following the neural interpretation of TVA (Bundesen et al.,  ), we focused on networks that comprise brain regions relevant for visual attention (for a review, see Parks and Madden,  ). White matter pathways might anatomically constrain functional network connectivity (Parks and Madden,  ), albeit not in a one-to-one fashion (Damoiseaux and Greicius,  ). Accordingly, based on the results of previous TVA-based studies relating individual variability in attention functions to variability in structural connectivity (e.g., Chechlacz et al.,  ), we expected to find a positive association between TVA parameter estimates and intrinsic FC. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Thirty-two healthy young subjects (25–27 years old) participated in this study. The “Klinikum rechts der Isar's” Ethics Committee approved the study, which was conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants gave written informed consent and were paid for their participation. All participants underwent BOLD-fMRI during rest and TVA-based assessment in separate sessions conducted on the same day (though one participant did not perform the TVA partial-report task and thus had to be excluded from the analyses). All had a normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and normal color vision. Before visual attention and MRI examination, participants were assessed for global cognitive functioning by trained psychologists using a short version of the German Wechsler Adult Intelligence scale-III (WAIS-III) (Von Aster et al.,  ), permitting computation of Full-Scale IQ. Demographic information is listed in Table  . Males and females did not differ in any of the demographic variables.

### Parametric assessment and estimation of visual attention functions 
  
#### General procedure 
  
The general TVA-based procedure for assessing visual attention functioning has been described in detail elsewhere (e.g., Finke et al.,  ). Briefly, to assess visual attention functions, participants performed, in a balanced order, whole- and partial-report tasks that lasted ~0.5 h each. Within a trial, a central white cross (0.3° visual angle) appeared for 300 ms, followed by a 100-ms gap after which the task-relevant stimuli were presented (Figure  ). Stimuli comprised of red or green letters (0.5° high × 0.4° wide) randomly chosen from a pre-specified set (“ABEFHJKLMNPRSTWXYZ”). Letters were generally terminated by masks (each composed of a square with a star inside), effectively overwriting iconic memory traces of the stimulus array (see below). Note though that trials without post-display masks were introduced in the whole-report task in order to increase the variability of “effective” exposure times (by allowing for an additional component of iconic memory buffering; Sperling,  ) and thus ensure reliable and valid TVA parameter estimation. Stimuli were presented on a 17-inch monitor (1,024 by 1,280 pixel screen resolution, 60-Hz refresh rate), in a dimly lit room. 
  
Whole- (  left  ) and partial-report (  right  ) tasks used to assess and estimate visual attention functions. In the partial-report task, targets (T) are presented in red, and distracters (D) in green. 
  

#### Visual attention capacity parameters 
  
Capacity parameters were derived from report accuracy in the whole-report task (Figure  , left), in which participants were instructed to report all letters they were fairly sure they had seen. First, in a pretest (24 trials), one individualized exposure duration was determined as the presentation time required to report one letter on average over several trials correctly. Shorter and longer exposure durations were then determined based on that value. Next, the three durations were used to present stimuli either unmasked or immediately followed by masking stimuli, thus resulting in six effective exposure durations (for more details, see Finke et al.,  ). The average short, intermediate, and long exposure durations were, respectively, 45.17 (  SD   = 7.0), 82.23 (  SD   = 17.26), and 164.90 (  SD   = 33.40) ms. The task consisted of 192 trials presented in 4 blocks of 48 trials each. Within each block, trials were randomized and presented equally often under 12 conditions (2 masking conditions [no masks, post-display masks] × 3 exposure durations × 2 hemifields). Performance accuracy (i.e., the number of letters reported correctly) was measured as a function of the effective exposure duration. Based on TVA, an exponential growth function was used to model the probability of selecting an object (Bundesen,  ; Kyllingsbaek,  ). The slope of the exponential curve at the minimum effective exposure duration   t0   (for masked displays) reflects the processing rate   C  —or number of elements processed per second—and the asymptote indicates the VSTM storage capacity—or the maximum number of items that can be simultaneously represented in VSTM. The effective additional exposure duration in unmasked displays (or parameter   m  μ) attributable to iconic memory buffering was also determined to validly estimate parameters   C   and   K  . Even though   m  μ was of no further interest in our study, it was necessary to estimate because, in unmasked displays, retention of visual traces in iconic memory allows for prolonged information processing (Finke et al.,  ). 


#### Visual attention weighting parameters 
  
Attentional weighting parameters were derived from report accuracy in the partial-report task (Figure  , right), in which participants had to report targets (red letters) and ignore distractors (green letters). On each trial, (a) a single target, (b) a target and a distractor, or (c) two targets were presented horizontally or vertically at the corners of an imaginary square (for more details, see Finke et al.,  ). As in the whole-report task, the individual exposure duration was determined in a pretest (32 trials) as the duration at which the participant reported single targets with 80% accuracy. The average exposure duration was 91.50 ms (  SD   = 23.42). The task consisted of 6 blocks of 48 trials each (i.e., 288 trials in total). In contrast to the whole-report task, the stimuli were always followed by a mask under 16 conditions (4 single target conditions, 8 target plus distractor conditions, and 4 dual target conditions). From the probabilities of target report, attentional weights were separately derived for targets and distractors, and for each visual hemifield, based on TVA. The selectivity of attentional weighting, or top-down control α, was estimated as the ratio of the attentional weights allocated to targets to the weights assigned to distractors. Lower α values would then indicate high selectivity or preference for targets (i.e., more efficient top-down control), whereas higher values would indicate less selective processing. In turn, the spatial distribution of attention across visual hemifields, or spatial laterality   w  , was defined as   w  / (  w   +   w  ), where   w   indicates the attentional weight allocated to the left visual hemifield and   w   the attentional weight allocated to the right visual hemifield. A value of 0.5 indicates balanced weighting, whereas values above or below 0.5 would be indicative of, respectively, left- or right-ward spatial laterality (Finke et al.,  ). 



### Resting-state fMRI 
  
#### Imaging data acquisition 
  
Imaging data were acquired on a 3T MR scanner (Achieva TX, Philips, Netherlands) with an 8-channel phase-array head coil. Participants lay comfortably with their heads surrounded by soft foams to reduce head motion. Before starting the functional data acquisition, participants were instructed to close their eyes but avoid falling asleep (i.e., resting state), and we checked with them at the end of the sequence that they had actually stayed awake. Functional data were collected across 10 min 52 s during resting state, and comprised 250 T2 -weighted volumes using a gradient-echo echo-planar sequence:   TR   = 2,608 ms;   TE   = 35 ms; flip angle = 90°; FOV = 230 mm ; matrix size = 64 × 63, 41 slices with 3.58 mm thickness and no interslice gap; reconstructed voxel size = 3.59 mm isotropic. Structural data were obtained from a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence:   TR   = 7.71 ms;   TE   = 3.93 ms; flip angle = 15°; field of view (FOV) = 256 mm ; matrix = 256 × 256, 180 slices; voxel size = 1 mm . 


#### Imaging data preprocessing 
  
The imaging data were preprocessed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF; Chao-Gan and Yu-Feng,  ), a toolbox in MATLAB (R2013a, version 8.1.0.604; The Mathworks Inc.; Natick, MA, USA). Briefly, the preprocessing included realignment, reorientation to the AC-PC axis of functional and structural images; segmentation of the structural T1-weighted image and co-registration of the segmented T1-weighted and the T2*-weighted functional images. No participant had to be excluded based on excessive head motion, which was defined as cumulative translation or rotation larger than 3 mm or 3°, or mean point-to-point translation or rotation greater than 0.15 mm or 0.1°. Six head motion parameters, as well as white matter, CSF, and global signals were entered as nuisance covariates and regressed out from the functional data. Next, functional images were normalized into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using unified segmentation of T1 image (Ashburner and Friston,  ), and resampled to 2-mm isotropic voxel size to keep the highest resolution possible. The normalized images were then smoothed using a 4-mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. 


#### Independent component and dual regression analyses 
  
Preprocessed data were temporally concatenated and analyzed by probabilistic independent component analysis (ICA) as implemented in FSL (version 5.0.7) using MELODIC version 3.14 (Beckmann and Smith,  ; Smith et al.,  ). A low dimensionality (i.e., 20 independent components) was chosen to decompose the data into more spatially extended components reflecting intrinsic brain networks (Smith et al.,  ). 

To obtain estimates of independent components for each participant, we performed a dual regression analysis (Beckmann et al.,  ; Filippini et al.,  ) using the group-independent components generated in the group ICA as input. Dual-regression analysis permits quantifying, for each subject, the FC of each voxel with each group-independent component while controlling for all other components (some of which represent artifacts) (Smith et al.,  ). Crucially for our study, dual-regression analysis is superior in detecting individual variability in FC compared to traditional approaches, such as seed-based analysis (Smith et al.,  ). Finally, FSL's   randomize   permutation-testing tool, based on 500 permutations and a   p  -value of 0.05, was used to obtain group spatial maps. 

The individual networks for each participant included voxel-wise Z-scores or standardized parameter estimates (by the residual within-subject noise) obtained from the second stage of the dual regression (for details, e.g., Smith et al.,  ). In other words, each map contained voxel-wise information on the particular contribution to an independent component while controlling for the influence of its contribution to all the other components (Filippini et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ). Thus, for each participant, we obtained 20 individual maps (one for each component), with the Z-score of every voxel, within each map, indicating how closely that voxel's time course resembled that of the respective group component. These individual voxel-wise Z-maps were further used for group statistics, in which group differences could manifest in any brain region belonging to the independent component, irrespective of whether or not that region is   typically   included in the brain network that the independent component represents (Smith et al.,  ). 


#### Selection of intrinsic brain networks for further statistical analysis 
  
The particular choice of networks on which we focused our analyses was based on both the neural interpretation of TVA (Bundesen et al.,  ) and the standard templates for intrinsic brain networks reported in the resting-state fMRI literature (e.g., Allen et al.,  ; Yeo et al.,  ). However, to establish a correspondence between distinct visual attention parameters and distinct intrinsic brain networks, we first needed to ensure that the relative independence among the networks was comparable to that amongst the different TVA parameters. For this reason, we chose ICA over, for instance, a seed-based approach: as a multivariate approach, ICA yields a set of statistically independent sources or components (Beckmann and Smith,  ); and as a data-driven approach, it can remove the noise (e.g., both physiological and scanner-related) from the data (Zuo et al.,  ). 

To select independent components representing intrinsic brain networks assumed to play a role in visual attention, we first identified relevant intrinsic networks by referring to typical networks described previously. In detail, to automatically select independent components reflecting intrinsic networks, we conducted multiple spatial cross-correlations with templates derived from FC based on resting-state fMRI of 1,000 healthy subjects (Yeo et al.,  ), in which a 7-network parcellation of the cortex was found robust, including visual, dorsal and ventral attention, and frontoparietal networks. It should be noted that the labeling of these networks—though fitting in the context of attention research—is somewhat arbitrary, as these networks are also involved in other cognitive functions (Smith et al.,  ), that is, there is no one-to-one mapping between intrinsic networks and function. After that, we chose the networks that best covered regions proposed by neural TVA to contribute to visual attention functions (i.e., frontal, parietal, limbic, and occipital; Bundesen et al.,  ), in particular: the visual, executive control, lateralized frontoparietal, and ventral and dorsal attention networks. To be independent of the special parcellation approach used by Yeo and colleagues for intrinsic networks (i.e., clustering), we considered it reasonable to compare our spatial maps with network templates obtained using ICA. Thus, we conducted further spatial cross-correlations but with intrinsic brain network templates derived from an ICA approach based on the resting-state fMRI data of 603 healthy subjects (Allen et al.,  ). We found the chosen networks to exhibit the greatest overlap with frontoparietal and occipital-visual networks (i.e., IC60, IC72, IC55, IC34, IC64, and IC27 of Allen et al.,  ) that have been related to attention functions previously (e.g., Corbetta and Shulman,  ; Fox et al.,  ; Dosenbach et al.,  ,  ; Vincent et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ; Finke et al.,  ), thus confirming our selection of attention-relevant brain networks. Note that ICA-derived spatial maps can have a larger extension and include more regions than those classically associated with a specific network (e.g., Smith et al.,  ), without compromising the reliability of the method (e.g., Zuo et al.,  ). 



### Statistical analysis 
  
#### Intra-network differences in functional connectivity between performance groups 
  
To examine for intra-network differences in functional connectivity, we took the individual versions of the previously selected networks from the results of the second stage of the dual-regression analysis (i.e., temporal regression; for details, e.g., Smith et al.,  ). First, based on the individual TVA parameter estimates, the group median was calculated separately for each of the parameters and used to split the sample into “high” and “low” performers (for parameters visual processing speed   C  , visual short-term memory capacity   K  , and top-down control α) and left- and right-preference (for parameter spatial laterality   w  ). Next, we tested for differences in intrinsic FC in visual attention-relevant brain networks between the groups based on the median splits using Statistical Parametric Mapping, SPM8 ( ). Specifically, using a second-level (i.e., group) general linear model, we predicted each voxel's intra-network FC (within each visual attention-relevant network) from TVA performance (i.e., performance-based subgroups of the variable of interest), controlling for the remaining three TVA parameters and for education and gender (i.e., variables of no interest). 

Because our goal was to systematically examine whether and how distinct TVA parameters are independently mapped onto distinct functional networks of the healthy brain, we performed six (i.e., one for each brain network) two-sample   t  -tests for each TVA parameter of interest. In the general linear model, intra-network FC was predicted from 7 parameters (i.e., 24 degrees of freedom). We contrasted the first two parameters, which correspond to the two levels of the main variable “performance-based subgroup” (i.e., “high” and “low” performers). Within each group, the images included the individual network-specific Z-maps derived from dual regression; each voxel within each of these maps took on a value indicating how close its time course reflected the group component's time course. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons (  p   < 0.05 FWE-corrected at the cluster level, voxel-wise height threshold   p   < 0.001) and only results surviving the additional Bonferroni corrections at the network level (i.e.,   p   0.05/6 networks = 0.0083) were considered further. 

We chose a median split over a linear regression approach, for the following reasons. First, given the strong homogeneity of our sample regarding demographics, brain integrity, and behavior, we had no reasons to expect robust linear relationships between the voxel-wise intrinsic FC and the TVA parameters. Second, as previous TVA-based studies on small healthy samples had revealed significant differences between high and low performers in experimental manipulations (e.g., Finke et al.,  ) or brain measures (e.g., Wiegand et al.,  ), we wanted to keep our analyses and results comparable to these studies. Third, TVA parameters have been proposed to reflect relatively stable characteristics of a given individual (e.g., Finke et al.,  ; Habekost,  ). Given this, we can assume that our median split-defined groups are random samples of “high” and “low” performers from the population. Finally, the independence of TVA parameters is given mathematically (Bundesen,  ) and empirically (Habekost et al.,  ), which reduces the probability (Iacobucci et al.,  ) of Type I errors (Maxwell and Delaney,  ). Note that, in our sample too, we did not find significant relationships between the different parameters:   p   > 0.072. 


#### Inter-network differences in functional connectivity between performance groups 
  
To examine for inter-network differences in functional connectivity, we took the results of the first stage of the dual regression (i.e., spatial regression; for details, e.g., Smith et al.,  ) and analyzed them using custom code written in MATLAB. For each participant, we correlated the time courses of the six independent components of interest and performed Fisher r-to-z transformation. Next, we tested whether the inter-network FC was significantly higher for “high” than for “low” performers. Finally, we examined whether intra-network FC correlated with inter-network FC.

Mean TVA parameter estimates for the entire sample, as well as separately for each performance and spatial laterality preference group are listed in Table  . Note that for the spatial laterality parameter   w  , the group mean did not differ from the value of 0.5, which indicates optimally balanced attention [  t   = −0.569,   p   = 0.573]. Males and females did not differ significantly in any of the TVA parameter estimates (data not shown; all   p   > 0.179). The TVA parameters did not significantly correlate with each other (all   p   > 0.072; see Table   for pairwise correlations). Furthermore, except for a significant correlation between processing speed   C   and IQ (  r   = 0.37,   p   = 0.039), they also did not significantly correlate with any of the demographic variables in the entire sample (all other   p   > 0.135). The group medians for the four TVA parameters used to split the sample are listed in Table  . Importantly, the resulting groups differed exclusively in the TVA parameter of interest and not in any of the other TVA parameters, education, age, IQ, or gender [  C  :   t   = 5.382,   p   < 0.0001, all other covariates:   p   > 0.150;   K  :   t   = 6.634,   p   < 0.00001, all other covariates:   p   > 0.108; α:   t   = −9.308,   p   < 0.00001, all other covariates:   p   > 0.184;   w  :   t   = −6.764,   p   < 0.00001, all other covariates:   p   > 0.191]. It is worth noting that only six participants (five males and one female) were always classified as “high” (three) or “low” (three) performers for   C, K  , and α. These participants did not differ in any demographic or TVA variable from the rest of the sample (  p   > 0.506). Thus, our participants have a distinct profile in terms of the different parameters, instead of exhibiting a more general, either “good” or “poor,” visual attention performance. Importantly, this corroborates the independence assumption maintained for the TVA parameters (e.g., Habekost et al.,  ) and indicates that the median split approach can be validly applied here.

### Selection of brain networks relevant for visual attention 
  
Six components that comprised occipital, lateral frontal and parietal, and limbic regions were selected as relevant for visual attention out of 12 functionally relevant components (Figure  ). These components were cross-correlated with the templates of Yeo et al. ( ) as well as with the ICA-based 28 network templates of Allen et al. ( ), and those with the highest coefficients were selected as networks (e.g., IC3:   r   = 0.57 with IC60 of Allen et al.; IC4:   r   = 0.40 with IC72; IC6:   r   = 0.49 with IC55; IC7:   r   = 0.34 with IC34; IC11:   r   = 0.43 with IC64; and IC18:   r   = 0.45 with IC27). 
  
Visual attention-relevant brain networks selected from 20 components obtained from independent component (IC) analysis and dual regression of resting-state BOLD-fMRI data of 31 healthy young participants. The spatial maps represent voxels significantly belonging to each network (  p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected) and are overlaid onto an anatomical high-resolution brain-extracted template in MNI space (Holmes et al.,  ; Rorden and Brett,  ; MRIcron). The labels just serve to identify them and follow conventional names given in the literature. 
  
The components shown in Figure   comprise the IC11 or “visual” network, mainly encompassing occipital clusters on the lingual gyri and calcarine sulci, as well as clusters on the right middle frontal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus bilaterally. The IC18 or “executive control” network included temporal and frontal clusters bilaterally on the superior and middle temporal gyrus, and the inferior frontal and precentral gyri, as well as on the precuneus and calcarine sulci. The IC3 or “right frontoparietal” network comprised parietal clusters bilaterally on the inferior parietal lobule, superior and middle temporal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus, as well as on the left cerebellum and left calcarine sulcus. For IC7 or “left frontoparietal” network, clusters were observed mainly in left frontal and parietal areas, including the inferior frontal gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, as well as in the right cerebellum, and left and inferior temporal gyri. The IC6 or “ventral attention” network included bilateral frontoinsular regions such as the insula, anterior and middle cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus, as well as bilateral regions of the cerebellum, the thalamus, and the caudate nucleus, and of parieto-occipital areas. Finally, the IC4 or “dorsal attention” network was formed by bilateral parietal clusters of the precuneus, superior and inferior parietal lobules, supramarginal gyrus, as well as middle and inferior temporal, superior frontal, precentral, and fusiform gyri, and cerebellum. 


### Intra-network differences in functional connectivity between performance groups 
  
Based on our approach of median splits of a group of healthy participants, we observed voxel-wise intrinsic FC group differences in three particular attention-relevant brain networks (Table  ). With respect to capacity parameters, we found significant group differences for visual processing speed   C   in the ventral attention network, but no significant differences for VSTM capacity   K  . With regard to weighting parameters, we found significant group differences for top-down control α in the dorsal attention and visual networks. In addition, for spatial laterality   w  , we found significant differences in the right frontoparietal network—though this result did not survive Bonferroni correction at the network level (Table  ). In more detail, the group with relatively higher visual processing speed showed lower intrinsic FC of the right middle frontal gyrus in the ventral attention network (Figure  ). Moreover, the group with more efficient top-down control showed higher FC of the right precuneus in the dorsal attention network and lower FC of the right calcarine sulcus in the visual network.

Group differences in intrinsic functional connectivity (FC). The group with higher visual processing speed   C   estimates showed lower FC of the right middle frontal gyrus within a ventral attention network (  left part  ). The group with better top-down control α estimates showed both higher FC of the right precuneus within a dorsal attention (  middle part  ) and lower connectivity of the right calcarine sulcus within a visual network (  right part  ). Significant clusters (in red) are overlaid onto the respective group spatial maps of Figure   (in yellow). Below these maps, respective group differences can be observed with respect to the Eigenvariate or average FC of the networks. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean. Significant clusters have FWE-corrected   p   < 0.0083. Red bars show   t  -values (see also Table  ). 
  
To account for possible differences in, for instance, noise levels between groups, we calculated the temporal signal-to-noise ratio of the realigned fMRI time series and repeated the analyses including the individual temporal signal-to-noise ratio as a covariate in the model. For the ventral attention and visual networks, the differences between groups remained the same [  t   = 4.74,   p   = 0.008,   k   = 60 voxels for the ventral attention network, and   t   = 6.49,   p   = 0.001,   k   = 129 voxels for the visual network; same cluster peaks for both as in Table  ]. For the dorsal attention network, the difference was slightly reduced, but still significant [  t   = 6.26,   p   = 0.013,   k   = 33 voxels]. Thus, group differences are unlikely attributable to systematic differences in signal quality. Differences in motion might still drive differences between groups. Given this, following (Smith et al.,  ), we checked whether performance groups differed in mean volume-to-volume head motion (e.g., Power et al.,  ), but we observed no significant differences: visual processing speed   C  :   t   = 0.82,   p   = 0.419; VSTM capacity   K  :   t   = 1.62,   p   = 0.113; top-down control:   t   = 0.47,   p   = 0.639; spatial laterality:   t   = 0.22,   p   = 0.826. As a further measure to ensure data quality (e.g., Smith et al.,  ), we checked participants with relatively extreme values in (a) the temporal signal-to-noise ratio, (b) the mean volume-to-volume head motion in mm, and (c) the proportion of outlier volumes. An extreme value was flagged if it was above or below the upper or, respectively, lower 5th percentile of the distribution of values in (a), (b), or (c). Two data points were flagged as extreme [< 9.39 in (a); > 0.26 in (b), and > 0.08 in (c)]. Excluding both participants slightly reduced the differences, which however remained significant (see Table   for comparison) [visual processing speed   C  :   t   = 5.45,   p   = 0.009,   k   = 59 voxels, peak = 38, 52, 18; top-down control α: dorsal attention network:   t   = 6.10,   p   = 0.022,   k   = 29, same peak; and visual network:   t   = 6.68,   p   < 0.0001,   k   = 165, peak: 8, −74, 10]. 


### Directionality of functional connectivity differences 
  
Based on the results of previous research on structural connectivity and individual variability in attention functions (e.g., Chechlacz et al.,  ), we had expected high performers to show high, rather than low, intra-network FC. Consequently, we decided to also explore   inter  -network FC (i.e., among brain networks) to better understand the finding of a relatively lower intra-network FC (i.e., among brain regions within one network) in “high” compared to “low” performers. More specifically, we wanted to ascertain whether or not a higher   inter  -network FC is observed for the visual and ventral attention networks (i.e., those with lower   intra  -network FC) in high performers. Inter-network FC has been shown to vary among individuals, with this variation associated with attention performance (Kelly et al.,  ). Thus, we expected to find a difference also in inter-network FC between high and low performers. Moreover, the strength of the negative relationship between “task-positive” networks (such as the attention-relevant networks) and “task-negative” networks (such as the default-mode network, known to deactivate during task conditions) has been associated with more consistent behavioral performance (Kelly et al.,  ). Thus, we hypothesized a   positive   relationship among our “task-positive” networks for high performers. Finally, we determined whether a   high   inter-network FC is related to the   low   intra-network FC of the visual and ventral attention networks. 


### Inter-network differences in functional connectivity between performance groups 
  
Here, we examined whether the inter-network FC would be significantly higher for “high” than for “low” performers in the visual and ventral attention networks and whether a lower intra-network FC would correlate significantly with higher inter-network FC—as hypothesized. 

To start with, the correlation matrix of the   Z   values (i.e., r-to-z transformation), averaged across the entire sample, is presented in Figure   to illustrate the inter-network FC. Next, Figure   depicts a group matrix for both visual processing speed   C   (left) and top-down control α (right), summarizing significant differences in inter-network FC between high and low performers. We only tested differences in the ventral attention network for visual processing speed, and in the visual network for top-down control (vector framed by white)—because, in both cases, the respective intra-network FC was lower for high compared to low performers. We found only the inter-network FC of the ventral attention network with the right frontoparietal network to be significantly higher in the group with higher visual processing speed   C   estimates (mean   Z  -values for high vs. low performers, 0.269 vs. 0.116,   t   = 1.685,   p   = 0.051, 1-tailed). For top-down control, only the inter-network FC of the visual network with the executive control network was significantly higher in the group with better (i.e., lower) top-down control α estimates (mean   Z  -values for better vs. poorer performers, 0.020 vs. −0.111,   t   = 1.895,   p   = 0.030, 1-tailed). These results, however, do not survive Bonferroni correction (i.e.,   p   = 0.01).

Higher inter-network functional connectivity (FC) values of the ventral attention (  left  ), and visual (  right  ) networks with the other networks were tested for the high performance group of speed and top-down control, respectively. The inter-network FC of the ventral attention network with the right frontoparietal network was significantly higher for the group with higher visual processing speed   C  . The inter-network FC of the visual network with the executive control network was significantly higher for the group with better top-down control α. The color bar shows   t   values (  df   = 29, high vs. low,   p   < 0.05). 
  
The observed high inter-network FC in high performers could explain the low intra-network FC. To test for this possibility, we computed the correlation between intra-network FC in the ventral attention and visual networks and inter-network FC of these networks with the right frontoparietal and executive control networks, respectively (while controlling for the intra-network FC of the right frontoparietal and executive control networks, respectively). We found a trend toward a negative correlation for the ventral attention network (  r   = −0.28,   p   = 0.069), and a significant negative correlation (  r   = −0.31,   p   = 0.045) for the visual network. This pattern indicates that high inter-network FC could indeed explain the observed low intra-network FC in high performers. 



## Discussion 
  
We examined whether and how visual attention parameters derived from TVA-based model fitting that are assumed to represent latent traits underlying the individual efficiency of the visual selection process are mapped onto distinct brain networks obtained from intrinsic functional connectivity (FC). We divided the sample into groups of high and low performers for each relevant TVA parameter and compared the FC of networks that encompass cortical regions relevant for visual attention. 

First, we found significant intra-network FC group differences for two TVA parameters. Participants with higher, vs. those with lower, visual processing speed exhibited lower FC of the right middle frontal gyrus within the ventral attention network. Furthermore, participants with more efficient, versus those with less efficient, top-down control exhibited higher FC of the right precuneus within the dorsal attention network and lower FC of the right calcarine sulcus within the visual network. 

Second, we found that for those networks for which participants with superior attentional performance showed lower   intra  -network FC than those with inferior performance, the same participants also showed higher   inter  -network FC. More precisely, significantly higher inter-network FC was found for the ventral attention network with the right frontoparietal network in the group with higher compared to that with lower processing speed. For top-down control, significantly higher inter-network FC was found for the visual network with the executive control network in the group with more efficient compared to that with less efficient top-down control. Our results demonstrate for the first time a distinctive correspondence between particular visual attention parameters and FC of different brain networks. These results thus contribute to the evidence that, in healthy participants, relatively stable individual differences in attention functions are reflected in similarly stable differences in intrinsic FC. 

### Visual attention capacity parameters 
  
#### Visual processing speed   C   and the ventral attention network 
  
Our finding of a linkage between visual processing speed and FC within the ventral attention network, and particularly in the right middle frontal gyrus, points to a role of this frontoparietal, limbic network for the rate of visual information uptake. As the ventral attention network has been previously documented to be relevant for tonic alertness (e.g., Sadaghiani et al.,  ; Sestieri et al.,  ; Coste and Kleinschmidt,  ), the current result is in agreement with theoretical proposals (Bundesen et al.,  ) and empirical evidence (Matthias et al.,  ; Finke et al.,  ; Vangkilde et al.,  ; Petersen et al.,  ; Wiegand et al.,  ) for a close link between alertness and visual processing speed. 

Further support for this link is provided by our additional finding (although uncorrected for multiple comparisons) of higher inter-network FC between the ventral attention and the right frontoparietal network. Right-sided brain regions have generally been implicated in the maintenance of an alert state under conditions without external warning cues (i.e., tonic alertness) and with increased time on task (i.e., vigilance) (e.g., Pardo et al.,  ; Sturm and Willmes,  ). In healthy individuals, the right middle frontal gyrus has been shown to exhibit higher activity during maintenance of an alert state (Sturm et al.,  ), as well as higher spontaneous activity during high degrees of tonic alertness, as measured by pupil size changes (Schneider et al.,  ). Moreover, in patients with tonic alertness deficits following right-sided ventral lesions, tonic alertness training leads to an increase in the activity of the right middle frontal gyrus (Thimm et al.,  ). Similarly, stroke damage to areas in the right mid-frontal lobe, often involved in the neglect syndrome, can also produce deficits in sustained attention (Husain and Rorden,  ). Finally, evidence from structural connectivity has also shown that the degree of right-side lateralization of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus is positively associated with visual processing speed in healthy young subjects (Chechlacz et al.,  ). In sum, in young healthy adults who process visual information faster, these frontoinsular and parietal networks that are important for tonic and phasic alertness, respectively, appear to be functionally well coupled. 

According to TVA, visual processing speed represents the number of visual elements that can be categorized in a given unit of time (e.g., 1 s; Bundesen,  ). This rate of encoding into VSTM depends on the strength of the sensory evidence, a perceptual decision bias, and the relative attentional weight of a specific object. In the neural interpretation of TVA, NTVA (Bundesen et al.,  ), the encoding speed is suggested to depend on both the number of cortical neurons representing the categorization and the firing rates of those neurons. More specifically, a perceptual decision bias determines how an object is categorized by changing the firing rate of the cortical neurons that code a particular feature (i.e., “pigeonholing”). The individual overall visual processing speed, parameter   C  , has been related, both theoretically and empirically, to alertness functions. For example, stimulant medication with methylphenidate and modafinil (Finke et al.,  ) as well as experimental manipulations enhancing phasic alertness (Matthias et al.,  ) have been shown to lead to an increase in this attentional capacity parameter. Recently, the effects of phasic alertness and temporal expectancy of upcoming stimuli were more formally integrated into the theory. More specifically, an enhancement of overall visual processing speed   C   was suggested, which would be given by a multiplicative upscaling of the activation, i.e., of the firing rates of all neurons coding the presented stimulus array by changes in perceptual bias (Vangkilde et al.,  ; Wiegand et al.,  ). Bias values have been proposed to derive from higher order areas (e.g., in frontal cortex) and, directly or indirectly, from the limbic system (Bundesen et al.,  ). 


#### VSTM storage capacity   K  
  
One reason for our non-significant findings regarding this parameter might be the low variability of the   K   estimates and, thus, the lack of statistical power at the present sample size. Another reason might be the reliance of VSTM capacity on spatially organized sustained activity implemented via recurrent thalamocortical feedback loops (Bundesen et al.,  ), as supported by studies on the connectivity of thalamocortical fibers (Menegaux et al.,  ). Thus, future studies could examine inter-network thalamocortical FC in samples with greater variance in this parameter (e.g., in aging). 



### Visual attention weighting parameters 
  
#### Top-down control α and dorsal attention and visual networks 
  
From a mechanistic perspective, the neural TVA suggests that top-down control is a selection bias, whereby higher “attentional weights” are assigned to objects that belong to a currently relevant category (e.g., red letters) (Bundesen et al.,  ). In the present study, we found that more efficient top-down control was linked with higher FC within the dorsal attention network, particularly in the precuneus. This result is in agreement with task-based neuroimaging studies (e.g., Wojciulik and Kanwisher,  ; Hopfinger et al.,  ; Weissman et al.,  ; Giesbrecht et al.,  ; Vossel et al.,  ), which have also revealed a general role of dorsal parietal regions in the control of selective attention. Importantly, however, our results add to the existing evidence for a role of the precuneus in attentional top-down controlled, task-based selection that is   independent   of individual capabilities in spatial attentional selection or processing speed. 

We found that more, versus less, efficient top-down control was associated with lower FC within the visual network, particularly in the calcarine sulcus. Importantly, lower FC within the visual network was significantly associated with higher inter-network FC of the visual network with the executive control network. Moreover, more efficient control was related to higher FC between the visual and the executive control networks, though this result did not survive Bonferroni correction. Thus, it appears that it is the degree of functional coupling of the visual network with the executive control network that might be relevant for the individual degree of efficiency of top-down control. This finding accords with the assumption of a critical role of the executive control network in the adaptive control of goal-directed selection (Dosenbach et al.,  ,  ). Collectively, ours and previous findings suggest, in agreement with theoretical accounts of visual attention (Posner and Petersen,  ; Desimone and Duncan,  ; Bundesen et al.,  ), that the efficiency of top-down control is related to the degree of interaction between the executive control network generating attentional control signals and sensory structures that process visual information. 

Of note, although we failed to find significant inter-network FC between the visual and the dorsal attention networks, our results do not imply a lack of functional interaction between the two. In fact, there are consistent reports of directed FC from the dorsal attention network regions to the visual network regions during tasks involving visuospatial attention (e.g., Corbetta and Shulman,  ; Bressler et al.,  ; Spadone et al.,  ). Rather, they only suggest that higher intra-network FC in the dorsal attention network is by itself important for more efficient top-down control. In other words, the role of the intra-network FC for top-down control would be additional to that of the inter-network FC between the visual and executive control networks. This interpretation is in line with proposals according to which multiple cortical and non-cortical sources may be involved in top-down control if they carry information about the behavioral task goals (Gilbert and Li,  ). On this view, our finding of significant inter-network FC of the visual network with the executive control network would not be surprising. In fact, the prefrontal cortex—a central component of the executive control network—has been shown to be a source of biasing signals in object-based attention (Baldauf and Desimone,  ). Thus, rather than directly implying a lack of interaction between the visual and dorsal attention networks—or, put differently, an exclusivity of the executive control network for top-down control over the visual network—our results point to the relevance of all three networks. 


#### Spatial laterality   w  
  
The lack of significant (Bonferroni corrected) group differences in any network for this parameter is not surprising in this sample of healthy young participants, given that no significant deviation from 0.5 in their   w   values was present. In neurologically impaired samples, by contrast, parameter   w   does exhibit high variance, such as in patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease, in which significant spatial biases have been revealed (Redel et al.,  ; Sorg et al.,  ). Accordingly, studies on groups with more evident lateralized attentional performance might well reveal a relationship of parameter   w   with FC. 



### Visual attention functions in the “resting brain” 
  
In mice, infra-slowly spontaneous neuronal fluctuations (i.e., 0.01–0.1 Hz) have been shown to underlie the intrinsic FC obtained from BOLD fMRI (Matsui et al.,  ). In humans, spontaneous slow cortical potentials (<0.5 Hz) measured with intracranial EEG have also been shown to be associated with intrinsic FC, where both have been proposed to reflect fluctuations of cortical excitability (He et al.,  ; Raichle,  ). These fluctuations indicate spontaneous subthreshold depolarizations of the cortical neuronal membranes, which influences the level of activation of cortical neurons (Wu et al.,  ). If spontaneous fluctuations of cortical excitability do indeed influence attention continuously, their spatial patterns of coherence among brain regions and networks could be captured by intrinsic FC. In consequence, the differential spatial patterns obtained by FC could, then, distinguish among separable attention traits. 

In support of such links, previous findings have suggested that particular functional interactions within (Markett et al.,  ; Rosenberg et al.,  ) and between (Kelly et al.,  ) spontaneously active functional networks relate to variability of performance in attention tasks. Here, we document that the differences among healthy individuals in attentional parameters that are assumed to reflect relatively stable capabilities or latent traits (e.g., Finke et al.,  ) correspond to the intra- and inter-network FC of particular functional networks. 


### Functional implications and further issues 
  
Healthy individuals differ in their ability to attend efficiently, and the TVA-based measurement provides for a systematic assessment of parameters expressing this variability (Habekost et al.,  ). While it is assumed that the different parameters reflect relatively stable capabilities of a given participant under stable environmental conditions (e.g., Finke et al.,  ), these capabilities might also change under particular circumstances. For example, the TVA parameters (Finke et al.,  ; Vangkilde et al.,  ) are influenced by certain pharmacological substances. Also, visual processing speed is enhanced by appropriate computerized training regimens (Schubert et al.,  ), whereas special populations such as patients with dyslexia (Stenneken et al.,  ), depression (Gögler et al.,  ), and schizophrenia (Gögler et al.,  ), exhibit reductions in visual processing speed. Furthermore, changes in attentional variability also occur during normal and pathological aging: healthy aging involves a slowing of visual processing (McAvinue et al.,  ; Habekost et al.,  ; Espeseth et al.,  ), and patients with mild cognitive impairment and the beginning of Alzheimer's disease reveal a staged decline of both visual processing speed (Bublak et al.,  ; Ruiz-Rizzo et al.,  ) and top-down control (Redel et al.,  ). 

Of theoretical importance, documenting specific relationships between changes in attentional functioning and intrinsic FC can stimulate hypothesis-driven analyses as to the brain mechanisms that underlie the changes. For instance, in studies employing neurocognitive enhancement procedures, it could be tested whether FC in specific networks might serve as a treatment target or a predictor of treatment success. Further, as regards disorders characterized by attentional dysfunction, focusing on changes in the FC of specific networks might help to better understand the cause of different attentional syndromes and improve diagnosis and treatment. As for patient populations, the advantage of our approach derives from its ready applicability: as information on multiple visual attention traits and functional networks can be obtained with two simple psychophysical tasks and one short, easy fMRI session, it can be used in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. This renders the approach particularly attractive for studies of aging populations to examine more directly whether the increasing severity of attentional dysfunctions is related to FC changes within and between particular networks. 

Our results highlight the relevance of particular functional networks for both visual attention capacity and weighting parameters. As a voxel-wise approach was used to identify the functional networks, differences were observed in specific regions within those networks. Note though that we do not consider those regions as being “responsible for” visual processing speed or top-down control, as the values associated with the voxels comprising those regions reflect their connectivity with a particular network (Beckmann et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ), rather than their activity. Accordingly, we see them simply as clusters whose voxels reached statistical significance in this particular sample; at best, they allowed us to identify the relevant networks for visual attention functions. Furthermore, given that we relied on the group median to divide our sample of healthy young adults, we cannot make strong claims about “increased” or, respectively, “decreased” FC in our sample. We propose it would be more useful to examine whether the directionality of FC holds practical significance in terms of, for example, predicting the level of BOLD activity or connectivity during the actual performance of the whole- and partial-report tasks. Previous task-related fMRI studies have shown that individual differences in visual attention functions might not be reflected that much in differences in BOLD-evoked amplitudes (e.g., Gillebert et al.,  ), but rather in differential connectivity between regions (e.g., Vossel et al.,  ). Given the previous evidence, it might be interesting to examine, in future studies, the associations between “offline” (i.e., during rest) and “online” (i.e., during task) measures of FC with separate visual attention functions in order to establish the practical relevance of the directionality of FC. 


### Limitations 
  
In interpreting our results, several limitations must be taken into account. First, although oculomotor activity was not monitored during the tasks, systematic eye movements are unlikely because of the brief exposure durations in both the whole- and partial-report tasks. Second, previous work has shown that frame-to-frame motion can impact resting-state FC (e.g., Power et al.,  ). Although we relied on the power of ICA to remove the noise from the signal corresponding to functional networks (Beckmann and Smith,  ; Zuo et al.,  ), a low-scale noise influence on FC measures remains possible. Thus, future studies ought to consider applying more stringent methods of head motion control such as scrubbing regressors even in samples of healthy young adults. 

Finally, although we checked that our participants had not fallen asleep during the resting-state fMRI sequence, we cannot entirely exclude that some of them had, without being aware of it. However, possible micro-sleep is unlikely to have compromised our intrinsic FC measures for two reasons. First, previous research has shown that FC of both higher-order and primary sensory networks can be maintained during the transition from wakefulness to sleep (e.g., Larson-Prior et al.,  ). And second, while spatial changes within functional networks (i.e., decoupling of the default mode network) have been reported during deep sleep (e.g., Horovitz et al.,  ), it is improbable that our participants had reached deep sleep within the ~11 min duration of the resting-state fMRI sequence, as they were not sleep-deprived and reaching deep sleep in an unknown and noisy environment is difficult. 


### Summary and conclusion 
  
In sum, our study shows that visual attention functions correspond distinctively to the functional connectivity both within and between particular functional networks. Within networks, (i) higher visual processing speed was associated with lower functional connectivity within the ventral attention network; and (ii) more efficient top-down control was associated with higher functional connectivity within the dorsal attention network and lower functional connectivity within the visual network. Between networks, higher functional connectivity was observed between (i) the visual attention and right frontoparietal networks for higher visual processing speed; and (ii) the visual and executive control networks for more efficient top-down control. Finally, lower functional connectivity within a network might be explained by the higher functional connectivity between networks. To conclude, our results point to a distinctive network-based functional representation of separable visual attention functions, laying the basis for testing specific hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying these functions in aging or pathology.

# Abstract
 
Multi-problem young adults (18–27 years) present with a plethora of problems, including varying degrees of psychopathic traits. The amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) have been implicated in moral dysfunction in psychopathy in adolescents and adults, but no studies have been performed in populations in the transitional period to adulthood. We tested in multi-problem young adults the hypothesis that psychopathic traits are related to amygdala and vmPFC activity during moral evaluation. Additionally, we explored the relation between psychopathic traits and other regions consistently implicated in moral evaluation. Our final sample consisted of 100 multi-problem young adults and 22 healthy controls. During fMRI scanning, participants judged whether pictures showed a moral violation on a 1–4 scale. Whole brain analysis revealed neural correlates of moral evaluation consistent with the literature. Region of interest analyses revealed positive associations between the affective callous-unemotional dimension of psychopathy and activation in the left vmPFC, left superior temporal gyrus, and left cingulate. Our results are consistent with altered vmPFC function during moral evaluation in psychopathy, but we did not find evidence for amygdala involvement. Our findings indicate the affective callous-unemotional trait of psychopathy may be related to widespread altered activation patterns during moral evaluation in multi-problem young adults.

## Introduction 
  
Psychopathy is a psychological construct characterized by affective callous-unemotional traits, impulsive and irresponsible behavior, and grandiose-manipulative interpersonal traits ( ). Individuals with high psychopathic traits engage in morally inappropriate behavior (e.g., committing crimes, lying, and cheating) and show a lack of guilt or remorse after performing antisocial actions ( ). However, research suggests they are generally capable of differentiating right from wrong when evaluating moral dilemmas or situations ( ,  ) and their moral reasoning can thus prove normal when assessed behaviorally. In the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in the underlying neurobiology of moral reasoning. Clarifying which neural processes are aberrant in persons with psychopathic traits may help understand why individuals with high psychopathic traits engage in their immoral behaviors. 

Previous studies have investigated the relationship between psychopathic traits and moral processing in (forensic) adolescents and adults, but as of yet no research has specifically focused on a young adult group (aged 18–27). Given that the transition from adolescence to adulthood ( ) is especially challenging for vulnerable populations ( ) young adulthood is an important period to study distinctly ( ). In the present study, we investigated a sample of young adults (18–27 years old) who dysfunction in society and suffer from multiple problems. These multi-problem young adults lack a stable income, do not have the prerequisites to get a job, most of them have engaged in criminal activities of ranging seriousness (e.g., from shoplifting to violent crimes), and two thirds of them have had Child Protection Service (CPS) interference, chiefly due to judicial problems before age 18 ( ). It is an ecologically valid sample in which antisocial behavior is displayed in varying degrees. Therefore, we expect their psychopathic traits to vary accordingly from very low to very high. We measured psychopathy continuously, which is preferable over a taxonomic approach ( – ) as it allows for the entire range of the construct to be taken into account. 

Brain areas that have been implicated in the processing of moral information in healthy populations include the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which are important for processing emotional information; the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which is engaged in utilitarian decision making; and the superior temporal gyrus (STG), which is important when thinking about others ( ,  – ). A recent meta-analysis of fMRI research of moral processing ( ) distinguished between studies investigating moral judgments about situations (moral evaluations) and studies requiring participants to make moral decisions as if they were the actor (moral response decisions), as evidence suggests these are at least partially different processes ( ). The current study focuses on moral evaluations. Six brain areas were found to be specifically involved in making moral evaluations ( ): the right and left STG, the left cingulate gyrus (CG), the right medial frontal gyrus (MFG; part of the vmPFC) and two distinct areas in the left MFG (one in BA9, one in BA10). 

It has been argued that amygdala and vmPFC dysfunction lie at the basis of the moral impairments of individuals high in psychopathic traits ( ). The amygdala is suggested to aversively reinforce actions that harm others; the vmPFC in turn processes this information and creates an outcome expectancy. When amygdala functioning is disrupted, the vmPFC fails to appropriately represent the valenced information, leading to immoral behavior. To date, decreased amygdala activity during moral processing (immoral minus nonmoral contrasts, where nonmoral stimuli are negative but not immoral) has been found in community volunteers with psychopathic traits ( ), but not in incarcerated males ( ), incarcerated adolescents ( ), or incarcerated women ( ). However, in the adolescent and female samples negative correlations between psychopathic traits and amygdaloid brain activity have been observed when contrasting both immoral and nonmoral stimuli with neutral stimuli (which are neither negative nor immoral). Negative correlations between vmPFC activity and psychopathic traits during moral processing have been reported in some studies ( ,  ), but not others ( ,  ). In short, although a theoretical basis for amygdala and vmPFC dysfunction underlying moral dysfunction in psychopathy exists ( ), neuroimaging results vary depending on samples and different ranges and variation of psychopathic traits within these samples. 

As mentioned, in the current study we investigated a sample of multi-problem young adults (18–27 years old) with varying levels of psychopathic traits. At the time of assessment, all participants were enrolled in a day treatment program intended to help reintegrate into society. Within this heterogeneous sample, we employed a task that requires participants to make moral evaluations about situations that are presented as pictures. We included a group of healthy controls primarily to assess whether the task worked appropriately and whether multi-problem young adults are capable of performing the task. We expected to find brain activity related to moral evaluation in line with the current literature (i.e., increased vmPFC, STG, and CG activity), and tested the hypothesis that the three psychopathic dimensions are negatively related to amygdala and vmPFC activity during moral evaluation in multi-problem young adults. We also tested whether psychopathic traits are associated with other regions consistently implicated in moral processing (i.e., STG and CG). We expected the affective callous-unemotional dimension of psychopathy to be specifically relevant as it is representative of behavior related to moral evaluation (i.e., shallow affect, lack of empathy, lack of remorse). We investigated the impulsive-irresponsible and grandiose-manipulative dimension exploratively. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Participants were 110 male multi-problem young adults [part of a larger study including 696 multi-problem young adults; ( )]. They were recruited at the start of day treatment program   De Nieuwe Kans   (DNK; translated as “New Opportunities”). DNK provides a multimodal day treatment program, which aims to increase the self-sufficiency and decrease recidivism of multi-problem young adults. Additionally, 25 age and gender group matched healthy controls were included in the study. Controls were selected to have average education. Exclusion criteria for the fMRI study were non-corrected defective vision and fMRI contra-indications. Ten multi-problem young adults were excluded due to excessive movement (  N   = 3) or poor task performance (e.g., more than 5 missed trials;   N   = 7). Three controls were excluded due to poor task performance. The final sample included 100 multi-problem young adults and 22 healthy controls. See Table   for an overview of the descriptive data.

This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Medical Ethical Committee of the VU University Medical Center. The protocol was approved by the VU University Medical Center Medical Ethical Committee (registration number 2013.422 - NL46906.029.13). All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants received a reimbursement of 30 euros for their participation in the fMRI protocol and an EEG protocol, which was administered on another day. 


### Instruments 
  
Psychopathic traits were assessed using the Youth Psychopathy Inventory – Short Version [( ); also validated in young adults; ( )]. The YPI-SV is a self-report measure that distinguishes three factors of psychopathy: an affective callous-unemotional factor, a behavioral impulsive-irresponsible factor, and an interpersonal grandiose-manipulative factor. We used the Measurements in the Addictions for Triage and Evaluation Questionnaire (MATE) to assess current and historic drug use. In order to measure intelligence, we used the short form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale third version (WAIS-III SF) consisting of four subtests ( ): digit symbol coding, information, block design, and arithmetic. The WAIS-III-SF was only assessed in the multi-problem group. See Table   for descriptive data. 


### Stimuli 
  
Three types of stimuli were used in the experiment: 25 immoral and negative (e.g., a person threatening another person with a knife); 25 non-moral and negative (e.g., people shouting at each other); and 25 neutral (e.g., people sitting next to each other). In order to select the stimuli, we first presented a set of 120 stimuli selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS;  ) (40 of each type as assessed by JZ) to a pilot group of 134 participants via the online tool Mechanical Turk ( ) and asked the participants to rate them on a 1-7 scale on their morality, valence, arousal, and complexity. From each category, 25 pictures were chosen in such a way that the immoral and nonmoral pictures matched on valence, arousal, and complexity, but not on morality. In other words, the moral and non-moral stimuli are specifically distinguishable on morality, which allows us to disentangle moral transgression from negative valence. For an overview of the average ratings of the stimuli see Table  .

### Procedure and task 
  
Participants were told they would be shown pictures that might contain moral violations and were instructed to judge whether this was the case or not on a scale from 1 to 4, where 1 indicated that no moral violation was presented in the picture and 4 indicated that a major moral violation was presented in the picture. Participants were asked to consider the morality of the event depicted whilst viewing the picture and to press on the appropriate button after the picture was replaced by a rating scale. Participants were told that there were no right or wrong answers and that we were interested in their personal opinion. 

Each trial consisted of a picture being shown for 5 s, a rating scale of 1–4 being shown for 3 s, and a variable inter stimulus interval of 3–8 s (average 5.5 s), introducing jitter into the experimental design. Pictures were presented pseudo randomly, with a maximum of three pictures of the same condition being shown sequentially. Participants performed three practice trials in order to ensure they understood the experiment. The experiment was administered in two sessions (the first with 38 stimuli, the second with 37 stimuli) with a small break in between so that the task would not be too demanding. The task is based on and similar to that used by Harenski et al. ( ). We adopted a different response procedure, requiring participants to press one of four buttons whenever they had decided on their answer, rather than pressing one button when the answer they wanted to give was shown on the screen. Also, we introduced jitter by varying the intertrial intervals around a mean value, rather than using three distinct intertrial intervals. The experiment was created and presented with Presentation 17.1 ( ). 


### MRI data acquisition and analysis 
  
MRI data were collected on a 3T GE Healthcare MRI scanner at Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam. Structural T1-weighted images were acquired with a fast-spoiled gradient pulse sequence in 180 sequential sagittal slices, with a thickness of 1.0 mm. The repetition time (TR) was 6.4 ms, the echo time (TE) 2.8 ms, the flip angle (FA) 12°, the field of view (FOV) 240 mm, and the matrix size 240 × 240 mm. Blood oxygen level-dependent T2 -weighted images were acquired axially with an echo planar imaging gradient echo pulse sequence in 42 slices of 3.5 mm with a slice spacing of 0.5 mm. The TR was 2,000 ms, the TE 30 ms, the FA 80°, the FOV 220 mm, and the matrix size 64 × 64 mm. 

Functional imaging data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12;  ). As preprocessing steps, for each participant functional images were realigned and unwarped, the structural scan was segmented and co-registered to the mean T2 -weighted image. Images were then normalized to the MNI template and smoothed with an 8mm full-width half maximum Gaussian filter. The three conditions were modeled as 5-s events with the standard hemodynamic response function. Six movement parameters were added as covariates of no interest. Our contrast of interest was the immoral > nonmoral contrast, which is expected to be representative of brain activity due to the moral salience of the stimuli, controlled for the (negative) emotional valence of the stimuli. 

We defined a priori regions of interest (ROI) based on the most recent meta-analysis concerning the neural correlates of moral decision-making ( ). We limited the ROIs to areas that were found to be consistently active during moral evaluation tasks. The a priori ROIs are the right and left superior temporal gyrus (STG;), the left cingulate gyrus (CG), the right vmPFC, and two distinct areas in the left vmPFC (one in BA9, one in BA10). Additionally, we included the right and left amygdala as ROIs since the amygdala has been implicated both theoretically ( ) and empirically ( ,  ) to be involved in moral processing and psychopathy. ROIs were created by forming 8mm-radius spheres around the peak coordinates (r-STG 53 12-28; l-STG-45-57 16; l-CG-3-59 26; r-vmPFC 3 59 4; l-vmPFC (BA9)-6 47 23; l-vmPFC (BA10)-4 54-5; l-amygdala-22-6-16; r-amygdala 24-4-14) that are reported in the literature ( ,  ). For the creation of the ROIs and the extraction of the ROI data we used the Marsbar toolbox for SPM ( ). 

For the behavioral and questionnaire data, in order to compare the ratings of the three picture types between each other and between the multi-problem group and the control group, we performed a repeated measures ANOVA with group as between subjects factor and   post-hoc t  -tests. To investigate the relationship with IQ in the multi-problem group we performed Pearson's correlations between psychopathy, IQ, and behavioral responses. All thresholds were set to α = 0.05 and   post-hoc   tests were Bonferroni corrected. 

For the neuroimaging data, we performed whole-brain analysis in SPM12. The conditions were modeled in the context of the general linear model, using the canonical hemodynamic response function. Standard family-wise error correction (  p   < 0.05) was applied. For the association between psychopathy and ROI-activity during moral evaluation in the multi-problem group, we performed multiple linear regression analyses using the total psychopathy score or psychopathy subscale scores as independent variables and the extracted ROI data as dependent variables. We performed the analyses with and without IQ and drug use as covariates. Cannabis was the only drug prevalent enough in our sample to take into account (see Table  ), we controlled for both recent cannabis use (past 30 days) and historic cannabis use (amount of years that the drug was used at least once per week). 



## Results 
  
### Behavioral results 
  
We compared the ratings of the three picture types between each other and between groups. A repeated measures ANOVA with picture type as within subjects factor and group as between subjects factor showed that the three types of pictures were rated differently in terms of moral violations across all participants [  F   = 530.52,   p   < 0.001]. Immoral pictures (  M   = 3.25,   SD   = 0.42) were rated as greater moral violations than nonmoral pictures [  M   = 2.11,   SD   = 0.65;   t   = 18.02,   p   < 0.001] and neutral pictures [  M   = 1.1,   SD   = 0.19;   t   = 52.34,   p   < 0.001]. Nonmoral pictures were rated as greater violations than neutral pictures [  M   = 1.11,   SD   = 0.19;   t   = 18.14,   p   < 0.001]. There was no main effect of group (  p   > 0.05), but we found a significant interaction between picture type and group [  F   = 6.84,   p   < 0.001]. 

Multi-problem young adults judged immoral pictures to represent smaller violations (  M   = 3.21,   SD   = 0.41) than controls did [  M   = 3.41,   SD   = 0.40;   t   = −2.10,   p   < 0.05]. In contrast, multi-problem young adults judged nonmoral pictures to represent larger violations (  M   = 2.17,   SD   = 0.65) than controls did [  M   = 1.86,   SD   = 0.64;   t   = 2.00,   p   < 0.05]. However, after Bonferroni correction, these tests failed to reach significance. Both groups rated the neutral pictures similarly (  p   > 0.05). See Table   for an overview. 

Within the multi-problem group, none of the ratings of picture types were significantly related to total psychopathy score and psychopathic traits (all   p  s > 0.05). We found a negative correlation between IQ and rating of the nonmoral stimuli (  r   = −0.41,   p   < 0.001) thus multi-problem young adults with lower IQs judged nonmoral stimuli to show larger moral violations. IQ was not significantly related to the ratings of immoral (  r   = 0.08,   p   = 0.41) and neutral stimuli (  r   = −0.17,   p   = 0.11). Finally, IQ was not significantly related to any psychopathic traits (all   p  s > 0.05). 


### Imaging results 
  
First, we performed a whole brain analysis of the contrast of interest moral > nonmoral across all participants. This revealed significant increased hemodynamic responses in the STG, in several distinct areas of the vmPFC, in the precuneus, the parahippocampal gyrus, in the middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and in the cerebellum (see Figure  ). Also, we found increased activation in the precentral gyrus and the thalamus, this is likely due to the setup of the task: when participants evaluated pictures as not representative of a moral violation or as representative of a slight moral violation they used their left hand, when participants evaluated pictures as representative of a somewhat immoral violation or a strong moral violation participants used their right hand (see Table   for an overview). No significant differences in activation patterns in any of the brain regions were found between the experimental group and the control group in the analyses of this contrast.

Second, we extracted the summary time courses for the a priori defined ROIs and performed linear regression analyses to examine the relationship between the level of psychopathy and brain activity of the immoral > nonmoral contrast in the multi-problem group. We found the total psychopathy score to be positively related to brain activation in the left vmPFC (BA10) (β = 0.22,   p   < 0.05) and the left STG (β = 0.23,   p   < 0.05). We found no significant relation in the other regions of interest. We performed hierarchical regression analyses adding one subscale of the YPI at each level in order to assess their individual contributions to the models. We found the affective callous-unemotional factor score of psychopathy to be positively related to brain activation in the left vmPFC (BA10) (β = 0.23,   p   < 0.05), left STG (β = 0.27,   p   < 0.01), and CG (β = 0.21,   p   < 0.05), see Figure  . The behavioral and interpersonal factors did not predict brain activity in any of the ROIs. See Table   for an overview.

Third, we added IQ and drug use as covariates in the models. This did not change any of the reported results, but IQ itself was positively related to brain activity in the left vmPFC (BA10; β = 0.18,   p   < 0.05), left STG (β = 0.20,   p   < 0.05), and left CG (β = 0.20,   p   < 0.05). 



## Discussion 
  
In this study, we investigated the relationship between psychopathic traits and the neural correlates of moral evaluation in a sample of male multi-problem young adults. Multi-problem young adults were able to discriminate between immoral and nonmoral stimuli, but less well so than the control group, as they gave nonmoral pictures higher moral ratings and immoral pictures lower ratings. In line with previous research, several specific brain regions showed increased activity during moral evaluation, most notably the vmPFC, STG, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus. We did not find any negative relationships between the brain activity in these regions and psychopathic traits in the amygdala and vmPFC. Rather, we found no effect in the amygdala and found positive associations in the left vmPFC, left STG, and left CG, indicating that multi-problem young adults high in psychopathic traits show a greater increase in brain activity in these areas during moral evaluation than multi-problem young adults low in psychopathic traits. 

Multi-problem young adults discriminated less between immoral and nonmoral stimuli than the control group. This difference does not seem to be driven by psychopathic traits, as both groups have similar psychopathic trait scores, and we found no relation between psychopathic traits and participants' responses to the stimuli. Potentially, this finding might be due to a difference in intelligence between groups. Although we did not formally assess the IQ of the control group, we can assume they have a higher level of intelligence than the multi-problem young adults given the low average IQ (mean IQ 83) and lower educational level of the multi-problem young adults. Furthermore, within the multi-problem group there was a moderately strong and negative correlation (  r   = −0.41) between IQ and the rating of the nonmoral pictures. It could be the case that individuals with lower IQs are less capable of separating negative situations from immoral situations or that they tend to overinterpret the information shown to them (e.g., if people are shouting, someone must have done something wrong). 

The lack of amygdala activity across both groups for the immoral > nonmoral contrast as well as the lack of relation between amygdala activity and psychopathy scores may indicate that amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy might not be specifically relevant to moral evaluations, nor to moral evaluation in general. There is strong evidence for amygdala dysfunction in emotion processing in psychopathy [e.g., ( – )], but the evidence for a relation with moral processing is less clear. For example, negative relations between amygdala activity and psychopathy have mostly been found in immoral + nonmoral > neutral, immoral > neutral, and nonmoral > neutral contrasts, but not in immoral > nonmoral contrasts ( ,  ). This would also explain why ( ) did find an effect in the amygdala as in their analysis they specifically contrasted “moral personal emotion-provoking” and “moral impersonal less emotional” dilemmas. Additionally, a recent and specific meta-analysis on moral processing found no evidence for amygdala involvement ( ) in contrast to an older meta-analysis ( ). 

In the vmPFC, we observed a positive relationship between psychopathic traits and brain activity during moral evaluation, indicating that young adults high in psychopathic traits show a greater increase in vmPFC activity during moral evaluation than young adults low in psychopathic traits. One possible explanation is that individuals high in psychopathic traits have to recruit this region to a greater extent in order to reach a normal level of moral evaluation. In fact, studies have shown increased prefrontal brain activity in criminal psychopaths during emotion processing ( ), increased dorsolateral prefrontal brain activity in community volunteers with high psychopathic traits during moral processing ( ), and the affective trait of psychopathy has been found to be positively related to frontal brain activity when viewing fearful faces ( ). Likewise, in a study in healthy participants, participants with lower moral judgment competence showed increased vmPFC activity during a moral evaluation task compared to participants with higher moral judgment competence scores. In this study, participants performing worse showed increased rather than decreased brain activity ( ). That such a mechanism of overcompensation is present in our sample and not in most studies on psychopathic traits and moral evaluation may be due to the specific age range of our sample or its low IQ. Whereas in other studies participants usually have average to high IQs, the average IQ within our sample is low and the variation is limited, it may be the case that a combination of high psychopathic traits and low IQ required multi-problem young adults to engage more brain activity in order to perform the task. Another explanation for the association is that as the vmPFC is a large brain area, distinct areas within the vmPFC may perform different functions when making moral evaluations. Therefore, generalizing activity from specific clusters across the vmPFC may not be prudent and future research disentangling distinct areas functioning within the vmPFC is needed to elucidate this. 

In addition to the effects observed in the vmPFC, we found positive relations of similar strength between psychopathic traits and brain activity during moral evaluating in the left CG and the left STG. In accordance with our vmPFC finding, the callous-unemotional affective factor of psychopathy accounted for these observations. A previous studies also reported a negative correlation between moral CG activity and psychopathic traits ( ) but no correlations between moral STG activity and psychopathic traits. However, a negative correlation in the STG has been observed using an immoral + nonmoral > neutral contrast ( ). As we included the CG and STG as ROIs, our analysis is more sensitive to effects in these areas and other studies may have missed these. Our results suggest that most of the brain regions associated with moral evaluating behave aberrantly in psychopathy, rather than the vmPFC and possibly amygdala specifically. 

As the effects we observed are all specific to the callous-unemotional affective trait of psychopathy, this is likely the main factor related to moral evaluation in our population. This does not seem surprising since moral evaluating requires empathy to assess a situation, whereas for example impulsivity and grandiosity may be more relevant when deciding what to do. It is possible that deficits in moral evaluation are driven by the callous-unemotional affective trait, whereas deficits in moral response decisions may also be driven by the impulsive and irresponsible behavioral, and grandiose-manipulative interpersonal traits. One study has shown psychopathic traits in a healthy sample to be related behaviorally to moral decisions, but not moral judgment ( ). It would be valuable for future research to delve into the neurobiological differences between moral evaluations and moral response decisions, and investigate whether distinct psychopathic traits are differentially related to these processes. 

A limiting factor in comparing our study to others is the fact that we used the YPI, which is a self-report questionnaire, to assess psychopathy rather than the more extensive PCL-R or PCL-YV ( ). The YPI has good convergent validity ( ) and the YPI and the PCL-YV correlate with moderate strength ( ), so it seems unlikely the positive relation between psychopathy and brain activity during moral evaluations is due to the use of a self-report measure. However, other research has suggested that psychopathy subscales specifically are not interchangeable between different assessment instruments ( ), so caution is warranted. Another limitation is that we did not use urine screens or breathalyzer to objectively assess whether participants adhered to the instruction to refrain from substance use prior to the MRI session, all participants reported adhering to the instructions. 

In conclusion, we found brain activation related to moral evaluation in the STG, in several distinct areas of the vmPFC, in the precuneus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and in the cerebellum in a group of multi-problem young adults and healthy controls; we found that brain activity in the left vmPFC, left STG, and left CG was associated with the affective callous-unemotional traits of psychopathy; and we found that IQ, but not psychopathic traits are related to the moral evaluations of participants. Our results add to the evidence that brain dysfunction underlies psychopathic traits in moral evaluation and suggest that most of the brain regions associated with moral evaluating are affected in young adults with higher levels of psychopathy, specifically on the affective callous-unemotional dimension, rather than the vmPFC and possibly amygdala alone.

# Abstract
 
Brainstem and midbrain nuclei are closely linked to cognitive performance and autonomic function. To advance the localization in this area, precise functional imaging is fundamental. In this study, we used a sophisticated fMRI technique as well as physiological recordings to investigate the involvement of brainstem/midbrain nuclei in cognitive control during a Stroop task. The temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) increased due to physiological noise correction (PNC) especially in regions adjacent to arteries and cerebrospinal fluid. Within the brainstem/cerebellum template an average tSNR of 68 ± 16 was achieved after the simultaneous application of a high-resolution fMRI, specialized co-registration, and PNC. The analysis of PNC data revealed an activation of the substantia nigra in the Stroop interference contrast whereas no significant results were obtained in the midbrain or brainstem when analyzing uncorrected data. Additionally, we found that pupil size indicated the level of cognitive effort. The Stroop interference effect on pupillary responses was correlated to the effect on reaction times (  R   = 0.464,   p   < 0.05). When Stroop stimuli were modulated by pupillary responses, we observed a significant activation of the LC in the Stroop interference contrast. Thus, we demonstrated the beneficial effect of PNC on data quality and statistical results when analyzing neuronal responses to a cognitive task. Parametric modulation of task events with pupillary responses improved the model of LC BOLD activations in the Stroop interference contrast.

## Introduction 
  
Accumulating research has revealed the close interrelationship between the autonomic state and motivation, attention, mood, or cognition. For instance, in addition to the strong influence of cognitive strains on autonomic function, feelings in the body that are associated with emotions (somatic markers) profoundly influence our decisions ( ;  ). Thus, the internal state determines the way we react to the environment ( ). It has been assumed that behavioral states might be related closely to neuromodulatory brainstem systems. Thus, assessing the activity of the autonomic nervous system is indicative of the functional state ( ;  ). Therefore, inclusion of peripheral indicators of autonomic function is an important addendum to research in neurosciences. 

One excellent example of such a close interaction is the human pupil reflecting both the autonomic state as well as cognitive demand ( ;  ). Thus, pupillometry has become a powerful tool in psychophysiology (e.g., see review by  ). Pupils have been shown to react to various types of cognitive demand, such as memory load ( ), arithmetic tests ( ), or speech processing ( ). A higher level of cognitive effort leads to a greater magnitude of pupillary reaction ( ;  ). The size of the pupil is determined by the sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow to the muscles of the iris ( ). Parasympathetic activation leads to constriction, whereas sympathetic stimulation results in dilation of the pupil. Preganglionic sympathetic neurons receive input from the posterior nuclei of the hypothalamus and project from the intermediolateral nucleus in the spinal cord through the sympathetic trunk to the iris. The Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWN) is considered to be the primary origin of parasympathetic influence on the pupils. In addition, the locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of noradrenaline in the brain, exhibits inhibitory influences on the EWN ( ;  ;  ). Given the reported co-variation of LC firing rate and pupillary responses ( ;  ), the dilation of the pupil has been considered as a proxy of noradrenergic activity in humans ( ;  ). 

The LC has been proposed to facilitate the dynamic reorganization of neural networks in response to external stimuli ( ).   highlighted its role in attention shifting and cognitive flexibility. They postulated that the LC is significantly involved in the dynamic switch between functional networks. The dorsal fronto-parietal network including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the dorsal parietal cortex is important for the selection of stimuli and generation of responses. The ventral fronto-parietal network with the temporo-parietal junction, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula as core regions, detects salient stimuli, interrupts and redirects attention ( ). 

Another physiological marker that has been proposed to indicate mental effort is the level of skin conductance ( ;  ;  ;  ). The secretion of sweat changes the electrical properties of the skin that can be recorded superficially ( ). In competitive analyses,   and   demonstrated measures of skin conductance and pupil size to be similarly suitable for indicating mental workload.   reported the pupil size to be more accurate than skin conductance to reflect cognitive load. 

The differential involvement of neurotransmitter systems in the generation of skin conductance responses (SCR) is still unclear.   showed that lesions to noradrenergic fiber bundles in cats abolish SCR and spontaneous fluctuation of skin conductance. In contrast, microinjections into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the midbrain’s dopaminergic center, had no effect on skin conductance. Neuroimaging studies reported that BOLD changes and metabolism in regions congruent to LC and VTA are related to spontaneous skin conductance fluctuations at rest ( ), and responses to fear ( ).   proposed a crucial influence of the reticular formation, a brainstem network including the LC, on skin conductance. Thus, the noradrenergic system might have a decisive role in generating SCR. 

Recently, we reported that the LC and VTA/Substantia nigra (SN) are significantly involved in cognitive and especially inhibitory control ( ,  ). We used the well-established   Stroop Color-Word   Test [SCWT, ( )] to investigate the neural correlates of cognitive control processes in the brainstem/midbrain. In the SCWT, participants shall name the color in which a word is presented ignoring the word itself. The color either matches the meaning of the word (congruent condition) or not (incongruent condition, IC). Incongruent trials require an inhibition of an overlearned, pre-potent response tendency (reading the word) in favor of an unusual, less pre-potent action (naming the color of the ink). We observed that BOLD activation of the LC and VTA/SN was higher in incongruent than in congruent trials. Compared to the VTA/SN, the LC was functionally connected to the dorsal fronto-parietal network. We additionally demonstrated differential activation of VTA/SN and LC modulated by demands of cognitive control. Our data gave additional evidence that phasic activation of LC facilitates cognitive conflict resolution and optimizes behavioral responses by activating specific task-related brain networks. 

However, brainstem and midbrain nuclei are small compared with the cortical regions involved in cognitive control, and are more susceptible to signal distortion and artifacts arising from local tissue interfaces and physiological noise ( ). Especially the position of the LC at the posterior border of the brainstem impedes its functional imaging. Neuromelanin-sensitive scans have added significant information on the anatomical location of the LC ( ,  ;  ) that can be used to validate the identification of LC ( ;  ;  ). Standard anatomical scans can also be used to detect activation of the LC ( ;  ). To link structures such as the LC with specific functions using fMRI, a precise match of anatomical and functional information is essential. To really advance our understanding in this field, improvement of functional data analysis is needed. 

In our present study, we used the SCWT to corroborate the involvement of LC and VTA/SN in cognitive control. To further enhance image quality, we prepared our data by applying physiological noise correction (PNC) and a specialized brainstem/cerebellum normalization technique. To improve anatomical and functional distinction between brainstem and midbrain nuclei, we applied functional scans with a high spatial resolution of 1.4 mm  and assessed simultaneously physiological responses of pupils and skin conductance to indicate cognitive efforts. We assumed a close association of LC activation and pupillary dilation in the Stroop interference contrast. Therefore, we hypothesize that including pupillary responses to model BOLD activation within the LC might enhance its identification. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Subjects 
  
Fourteen healthy subjects (nine females, five males, age: 27 ± 7 years) participated in this study. The following exclusion criteria were applied: any disease or impairment of the circulatory system, the peripheral nervous system or the endocrine system, alcohol- or drug abuse. Subjects with past or current neurological or psychiatric diseases according to M.I.N.I ( ) and/or first-degree relatives with Axis I psychiatric disorders were excluded from the study. None of the study participants was taking any psychopharmacological medication. 

Three subjects were excluded due to inadequate quality of the eye tracker signal (see below). Thus, eleven subjects were analyzed (seven males, four females, age: 28 ± 7 years). All participants were German native speakers, right-handed according to the modified version of Annett’s Handedness Inventory ( ). All participants gave written consent to a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Jena in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 


### Experimental Paradigm 
  
Participants conducted the manual version of the Stroop color word task ( ;  ). In brief, participants had to choose the color of the word written in the center of the projected screen. In the congruent condition, the color of the word matches its meaning. In the IC, the color word is displayed in a color, which is not denoted by the word. Subjects were instructed to indicate one of two possible answers presented at the bottom of the screen by pressing a button of the pad with the right index or middle finger. Correct answers were counterbalanced on the right and left sides of the display. In a pseudorandomized order, 18 congruent and 18 incongruent stimuli were presented for 1500 ms each, with an inter-stimulus interval of 10.5 s. Additionally, a temporal jitter was introduced to enhance the temporal resolution. 


### MRI Parameters 
  
Functional data was collected on a 3 T Magnetom PRISMA fit whole-body system (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 64-element receive-only head matrix coil. Head immobilization was achieved using head pads within the coil. T2 -weighted images were obtained using a gradient-echo EPI sequence (TR = 2040 ms, TE = 33 ms, flip angle = 75) with 100 contiguous transverse slices of 1.4 mm thickness and a multi-band acceleration factor of four covering the entire brain and including the lower brainstem. Matrix size was 138 × 138 pixels with in-plane resolution of (1.4 × 1.4) mm . A series of 220 whole-brain volume sets were acquired in one session. High-resolution anatomical T1-weighted volume scans (MP-RAGE) were obtained in sagittal orientation (TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.07 ms, TI = 900 ms, flip angle = 9%, FOV = 256 mm, matrix = (256 × 256) mm , number of sagittal slices = 192, with an isotropic resolution of (1 × 1 × 1) mm . 


### Physiological Recordings 
  
Photoplethysmogram (PPG), respiration and skin conductance were recorded throughout MR image acquisition at 500 Hz using an MR-compatible polygraph MP150 (BIOPAC Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, United States). Respiratory activity was assessed by a strain gage transducer incorporated in a belt that was tied around the chest, approximately at the level of the processus xiphoideus. The respiratory signal was amplified between 0.05 and 10 Hz and temporally smoothed (250 samples). The PPG sensor was attached to the proximal phalanx of the left index finger. The finger pulse signal was recorded in a frequency range of 0.05–3 Hz and smoothed over 50 samples. Skin conductance was measured continuously (constant voltage 1technique) at the left hand’s palm with Ag/AgCl electrodes placed at the thenar and hypothenar eminence. The signal was amplified below 10 Hz, median filtered (150 samples) and smoothed (250 samples). 

Pupillometric recordings were conducted using a MR-compatible ASL Long Range Optic Eye Tracker (Applied Science Laboratories, Bedford, MA, United States). Pupil diameter (PD) and gaze position were extracted from the video stream and sampled at 120 Hz. Artifacts and closed eyes were automatically detected by the software and replaced offline by linear interpolation of adjacent values. PD was smoothed over 100 samples. Only recordings with artificial samples less than 10% of all acquired data during the recording were analyzed (mean artifact rate of the final sample was 3.3%). Trigger output of the MR scanner was logged by the presentation software and recorded by the polygraph and the eye tracker to synchronize all the acquired data with the task paradigm. 


### Physiological Noise Correction 
  
Prior to preprocessing, physiological fluctuations synchronized with cardiac and respiratory cycles were removed using the RETROICOR approach ( ). To account for low frequency variations in the BOLD signal through slow blood oxygenation level fluctuations, five respiration volumes per time (RVT) regressors were additionally removed ( ). The RVT regressors consisted of the RVT function and four delayed terms at 5, 10, 15, and 20 s ( ;  ), while eight low-order Fourier time series (four based on the cardiac phase and four on the respiratory phase) were created using the RETROICOR algorithm. All regressors were generated on a slice-wise basis by AFNI’s RetroTS.m script implemented in MATLAB 2016b, which takes the cardiac and respiratory time series synchronized with the fMRI acquisition as input. 


### Image Data Preprocessing 
  
For image processing and statistical analyses, we used SPM12 . The first four images were discarded to avoid contributions from non-steady-state tissue magnetization. The remaining 216 images were corrected for differences in time acquisition by sinc-interpolation and realigned to the first image. The co-registered anatomical images were segmented using the tissue probability maps. Functional images were then spatially normalized to the MNI space using parameters estimated during the segmentation process. 


### Specialized Brainstem/Midbrain Co-registration 
  
To improve the image normalization at the brainstem level, data was normalized to the spatially unbiased infra-tentorial template [SUIT, version 3.1, ( )]. Using the SUIT toolbox, we applied the following preprocessing steps: (i) segmentation of the whole-brain image; (ii) cropping of the image, retaining only the cerebellum and brainstem; (iii) normalization using the DARTEL engine ( ) that uses gray and white matter segmentation maps produced during cerebellar isolation to generate a flow field using Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping ( ), and (iv) re-slicing to a voxel size of (1.5 × 1.5 × 1.5) mm . 

Whole brain and cropped data were smoothed with a Gaussian filter of 4 mm FWHM and high-pass filtered with a cutoff period of 128 s and corrected for serial correlations choosing AR (1). 


### Temporal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (tSNR) 
  
The quality of the data was quantified in terms of the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR). It was calculated voxel-wise as the BOLD signals temporal mean divided by its standard deviation ( ). To compare the change of quality due to PNC at the brainstem level, we calculated mean tSNR maps after standard preprocessing of corrected and uncorrected data (standard co-registration, unsmoothed). Additionally, we estimated a mean tSNR map of the data used for our analyses (with specialized co-registration, PNC and smoothing). 


### Physiological Recordings: Event-Related SCR and PDR 
  
Physiological responses were extracted at the onset of stimulus presentation (reference time   t   = 0) with a duration of 10 s and referenced to baseline (mean value within 1 s before stimulus onset). We averaged reactions in congruent and incongruent Stroop trials. The area under the curve (AUC) and maximum of each PD and SC reaction was estimated and compared in terms of a paired   t  -test between conditions. The AUC per subject was used as measure of the strength of PD and SCR in all further analyses. The pupillary Stroop effect was defined as percentage increases of PDR in IC compared to CC ( ). Stroop interference effect, i.e., the percentage increase of reaction times from CC to IC was correlated to the pupillary Stroop effect. 


### FMRI Statistical Data Analysis 
  
Reaction times and characteristics of physiological responses to congruent and incongruent Stroop stimuli were compared by a paired   t  -test. To assess a possible decline of physiological reactions over trials, we standardized all reactions (AUC) to the first trial and correlated these ratios to the trial number. 

In   model 1  , neural responses to incongruent (IC) and congruent Stroop stimuli (CC) were modeled by convolving a series of impulses at stimulus onset times by the hemodynamic response function. The single-subject general linear model (GLM) included the regressors of CC and IC, as well as six head motion parameters estimated during image realignment. 

In   model 2  , each Stroop stimulus was weighted by the evoked SCR. Therefore, SCR was added as a parametric modulator to   model 1  . Single subjects GLMs included modulated task regressors (CC and IC) and six head motion parameters as covariates. 

In   model 3  , pupillary responses were used for parametric modulation of Stroop stimuli in the same manner as in   model 2  . 

Subject-specific parameter estimates were then entered into a second-level RFX analysis. We set up an ANOVA design with the within-subject factor TASK (CC and IC) and tested for the interference contrast IC vs. CC. All statistical maps were thresholded at the voxel-level with   p   < 0.005 (uncorrected) and cluster-level corrected with the number of expected voxels per cluster ( ). To investigate the influence of PNC,   model 1   was estimated on data corrected for physiological noise as well as uncorrected data.   Model 2   and   model 3   were estimated on PNC data. To assess an overlap between activated brainstem clusters and LC location, we used the anatomical mask image in the MNI coordinate space based on  . This mask represents the extent of peak LC signal distribution, obtained from a sample of 44 healthy adults using high-resolution T1-weighted Turbo Spin Echo MRI. 

We investigated the changes of luminance due to the presentation of color words of different length and ink color. In our lab outside the scanner, we used the toolbox phyphox  (RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany) running on a Samsung Galaxy tablet to record luminance during the Stroop task. Mean luminance changes during stimulus presentation were calculated to check for a difference of luminance between task conditions. 



## Results 
  
### Effect of Physiological Noise Correction on tSNR 
  
We detected increases of the tSNR throughout the brainstem (see   Figure   ). The improvement was most pronounced around tissue borders to cerebral spinal fluid, but also within the midbrain, brainstem and cerebellum. The tSNR of our data used for analyses was 67.8 ± 15.9 on average within the SUIT template (  Figure   ).

### Effect of Physiological Noise Correction on Statistical Results (Stroop Interference Contrast) 
  
Without PNC, a cluster in the upper anterior pons showed increased activations in the incongruent compared to the congruent condition (  x   = 0,   y   = -24,   z   = -21,   t   = 3.69,   p   < 0.005,   k   = 12). Three clusters in the cerebellum also showed significant activation in the Stroop interference contrast (see   Figure    and   Table   ).

After PNC, we found that three clusters in the midbrain were more activated in the incongruent than in the congruent condition (  Figure   ). One cluster most probably overlapped with the substantia nigra (SN,   x   = -6,   y   = -19,   z   = -16,   t   = 4.29,   p   < 0.005,   k   = 28) and one was situated adjacent to the aqueduct (periaqueductal gray, PAG,   x   = -7,   y   = -30,   z   = -4,   t   = 3.89,   p   < 0.005,   k   = 56). Additional activations were found in the cerebellum (see   Table   ). There was no overlap of significant clusters of uncorrected and PNC data in the Stroop interference contrast. 


### Behavioral and Physiological Reactions to the Stroop Task 
  
Subjects responded significantly slower in incongruent (1223 ± 328 ms) than in congruent trials (1036 ± 216 ms,   t   = -4.16,   p   < 0.01), indicating a reliable induction of the Stroop effect. Errors and missing responses (  n   = 11) occurred in the IC only. Reaction times decreased with increasing trial number of the IC (  R   = 0.333,   p   < 0.05) and the CC (  R   = 0.349,   p   < 0.01) revealing a general learning effect. 

As shown in   Figures  –  , pupil diameter responses (PDR) were higher in incongruent (IC, green) than in congruent trials (CC, blue). The area under PDR was lower in the CC (1241 ± 1043 n.u.) compared to the IC (2155 ± 1110 n.u.,   t   = -2.24,   p   < 0.05;   Figure   ). The maximum pupil size was 1.135 ± 0.038 n.u. in CC trails and 1.159 ± 0.041 n.u. in IC trials (  t   = -2.45,   p   < 0.05;   Figure   ). There was a significant habituation of pupillary responses during CC (R  = 0.459,   p   < 0.01) and IC (R  = 0.223,   p   < 0.05). The pupillary Stroop effect correlated to the Stroop interference effect (R  = 0.464,   p   < 0.05).

(B)   Area under PDR during the CC (blue) and IC (green).   (C)   Maximum PDR during the CC (blue) and IC (green).   (D)   Mean skin conductance reactions in the CC (blue) and IC (green), with standard deviation indicated by shaded areas.   (E)   Area under SCR during the CC (blue) and IC (green).   (F)   Maximum SCR during the CC (blue) and IC (green).   p   < 0.05. 
  
There was no significant difference between SCR during the incongruent and congruent condition (  Figure   ). Similarly, the maximum, the area under SCR and the latency of SCR were not different (  Figures   ). We found no linear decrease of SCR indices over trials and no correlation to reaction times. 

During the task, luminance decreased by 2.15 ± 1.45% in CC and 2.11 ± 1.44% in IC trials. There was no significant difference of luminance between the two conditions. 


### SCR Parametric Modulation of Stroop Stimuli 
  
Modulating Stroop stimuli using SCR, a significant activation of the SN in the Stroop interference contrast was replicated (  x   = -6,   y   = -24,   z   = -15,   t   = 3.91,   p   < 0.005,   k   = 39) together with most cerebellar clusters (see   Table   ). In contrast, no activation of the periaqueductal gray was detected.

### PDR Parametric Modulation of Stroop Stimuli 
  
When Stroop stimuli were weighted by PDR, the Stroop interference contrast revealed a significant activation of a tube-like cluster at the posterior brainstem (  Figure    and   Table   ). The overlap with the anatomical mask of the LC suggested that the activated cluster overlaps with both lateral branches of the upper LC (  Figure   ).

## Discussion 
  
In this study, we combined high-resolution fMRI, advanced brainstem co-registration, PNC and physiological recordings in order to precisely identify brainstem and midbrain regions involved in cognitive control. We demonstrate the enhancement of signal quality due to PNC as well as its beneficial effect on the statistical results. The signal to noise ratio was increased especially in tissue adjacent to arteries and spaces filled with cerebrospinal fluid. The analysis of PNC data replicated the involvement of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic system in cognitive control whereas uncorrected data revealed no brainstem/midbrain activations. We found that pupil size was a sensitive indicator of the level of cognitive demand. When Stroop stimuli were modulated by pupillary responses, we observed a significant activation of the LC. 

About 20,000–50,000 neurons build the LC as a symmetric structure at the dorsal brainstem with a rostrocaudal extent of 12–17 mm and a diameter of about 2.5 mm ( ;  ). It begins rostrally in the caudolateral part of the mesencephalic central gray, at the level of the inferior colliculus, and extends caudally to a position in the lateral wall of the fourth ventricle ( ;  ). Neurons of the LC project to various regions throughout the cerebral cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, brainstem, midbrain, cerebellum, and the spinal cord ( ;  ;  ). Electrophysiological studies have shown that the LC selectively responds to salient stimuli that entail attention disruption and reorientation ( ;  ). The recorded LC activity was previously decomposed into a tonic and phasic component ( ). Tonic activity represents a kind of baseline arousal and is low during certain automatic behavior and drowsiness. LC neurons become phasically activated by salient stimuli ( ;  ). 

The LC is an important relay of the noradrenergic and dopaminergic circuitry of the brainstem ( ). The LC-noradrenergic system regulates the balance between selective and flexible attention. At rest, we have recently shown that the LC is functionally integrated into the executive-control network ( ). Under external stimulation, the LC seems to dynamically moderate the switch between distinct functional networks depending on the salience of incoming stimuli ( ;  ). It has been demonstrated previously that the incongruent Stroop task condition, requiring inhibitory control, activates the neural cognitive control network consisting of the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the posterior parietal cortex and subcortical structures ( ;  ;  ). In our recent study, we additionally found that incongruent Stroop stimuli trigger the activation of the LC ( ). In the current study, we wanted to investigate the influence of enhanced preprocessing techniques on BOLD activations during the Stroop task. 

Considering the spatial extent of brainstem nuclei, functional MR imaging requires highly precise approaches ( ). In our current analysis, the spatial resolution is far more sensitive compared to previous investigations ( ;  ). Additionally, we prepared the acquired functional data by PNC involving cardiac and respiratory signals. We demonstrated that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of brainstem images benefits from PNC due to the presence of nearby major arteries and cerebrospinal fluid filled spaces ( ). Especially along the posterior border of the brainstem, an increase of temporal SNR was detected. In this region important nuclei of the ascending reticular system, the serotonergic system, the noradrenergic system etc. are located. After PNC and brainstem/cerebellum specialized co-registration an average temporal SNR of 67.8 was achieved. The SNR map resamples the results reported by  . He highlighted the effect of noise from non-neural sources and reviewed different correction approaches (e.g., RETROICOR). In brainstem fMRI, the increase of signal quality by using RETROICOR was documented previously (see  ;  ). In our approach here, we use five respiration volume per time regressors additionally to the RETROICOR cardiac and respiratory phase regressors ( ). 

In this study, we show that PNC has a crucial impact on the results that revealed the analysis of BOLD activations during the Stroop task. Without PNC, the only activated cluster outside the cerebellum was located along the midline of the upper anterior pons. When analyzing PNC data, significant activations within the SN and a region adjacent to the aqueduct, presumably in the periaqueductal gray, were detected. The activation of the dopaminergic VTA and SN in the Stroop interference contrast was demonstrated previously ( ). The periaqueductal gray is an important interface of the midbrain/brainstem to cortical area with connections to areas involved in cognitive control such as the prefrontal and cingulate cortex as well as the ventral striatum ( ;  ). Via nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways, BOLD activations of the VTA/SN are associated with goal-directed motivational behavior ( ;  ). Therefore, the detected activations appear far more plausible when underlying data was corrected for the influence of physiological noise. As significant clusters in the Stroop interference contrast of corrected and uncorrected data did not overlap, PNC has fundamental influence on the results of our study. The analysis of uncorrected data revealed an activation running along the midline of the upper pons – an area susceptible to physiological noise. As our sample is rather small, statistical analyses are particularly vulnerable to spurious results due to artifacts and inaccurate co-registration. Thus, the correction for physiological noise seem essential to reveal adequate results. 

In agreement with previous reports, the pupillary response (PDR) was sensitive to different demands of cognitive control in the Stroop task ( ;  ;  ). Similar to reaction times, PDR decreased over the course of the experiment with a more pronounced decline in the congruent than in the IC. Thus, the learning effect during the task seems to be reflected in pupillary reactions. 

Skin conductance responses were not different between both task conditions and were neither related to reaction times nor trial number. However, we observed a marked increase of SCR in the incongruent compared to the congruent condition, which might be statistically detectable in a bigger sample. The time course of skin conductance is determined by a tonic and a phasic component. Stimuli might elicit multiple overlapping SCR as well as an increase of the tonic level ( ). Although the area under curve was demonstrated to capture SCR characteristics appropriately ( ;  ), the variance of SCR measures seems to be higher than pupillary indices. 

The reactions of physiological signals were used to weight Stroop stimuli. Parametric modulation with SCR led to similar results as the analysis without modulation. In the brainstem/midbrain, the only activation was found in the SN. When events are combined with pupillary responses, a significant activation of a tube-like cluster at the posterior brainstem was found. The activated cluster overlapped with both lateral branches of the upper LC as indicated by the anatomical mask of the LC ( ). Given the strong co-variation of LC activity during task performance and PD, we hypothesized that the pupillary signal might be useful to track LC activity ( ;  ;  ). It seems that the modulation of Stroop events with physiological information was more accurately modeling the BOLD activation in the LC than the standard GLM. 

However, the activated cluster is not completely matching the anatomical demarcation of the LC. The remaining activation between the two lateral branches of the LC might be due to a response of other nuclei located in this region, such as medial reticular nuclei or the dorsal raphe nucleus. Spatial smoothing might blur individual blobs of activation to a great cluster. However, smoothing improves the validity of statistical tests by normalizing the error distribution and compensating for small variations of individual brain anatomy. 

Some limitations of our study have to be addressed. A drawback of our experimental design is the lack of luminance control as words presented on the screen vary in length and color. Because luminance was not different in both conditions, a systematic influence on our results seems unlikely. Furthermore, the statistical power is limited with respect to sample size and number of Stroop stimuli. The parametric modulator had a strong impact on our results, which might be due to the restricted statistical power. However, our results indicate that the statistical analysis benefits from a precise modulation of BOLD activation using physiological markers. 


## Conclusion 
  
In conclusion, we used a sophisticated fMRI technique and physiological recordings to investigate the involvement of brainstem/midbrain nuclei in cognitive control. We demonstrated a positive effect of PNC on data quality and statistical results. Finally, we corroborated previous findings that the dopaminergic SN and noradrenergic LC play a central role in cognitive control and demonstrated the reproducibility of this result on a small sample ( ). We investigated PD and skin conductance as autonomic markers of cognitive demand. By including the pupillary responses in our functional data analysis, we validated the location and functional role of the LC. We conclude that physiological signals are useful for modeling noise contaminating the BOLD signal but also BOLD signal changes of interest.

# Title

Cerebellar and premotor activity during a non-fatiguing grip task reflects motor fatigue in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
Fatigue is a common and highly disabling symptom of multiple sclerosis. Patients experience an effort-independent general subjective feeling of fatigue as well as excessive fatigability when engaging in physical or mental activity. Previous research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revealed heterogeneous findings, but some evidence implicates the motor system. To identify brain correlates of fatigue, 44 mildly impaired patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and 25 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla, while they performed alternating blocks of rest and a non-fatiguing precision grip task. We investigated neural correlates of fatigue using the motor subscore of Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC ) using the bilateral motor cerebellum, putamen, and dorsal premotor cortex as regions of interest. Patients and healthy controls performed the grip force task equally well without being fatigued. In patients, task-related activity in lobule VI of right motor cerebellum changed in proportion with individual FSMC  scores. In right dorsal premotor cortex, linear increases in activity across consecutive task blocks scaled with individual FSMC  scores in healthy controls, but not in patients. In premotor and dorsomedial prefrontal areas, patients were impaired at upscaling task-related activity the more they were affected by motor fatigue. The results support the notion that increased sensorimotor processing in the cerebellum contributes to the experience of motor fatigue and fatigability in multiple sclerosis. Additionally, downscaling of motivational input or sensorimotor processing in prefrontal and premotor areas may constitute an additional pathophysiological factor.

Fatigue is one of the most common and disabling symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS) [ – ]. Fatigue is a complex phenomenon to study because the patients experience an effort-independent general subjective feeling of fatigue as well excessive fatigability when engaging in physical or mental activity [ ]. Effort-independent fatigue is often referred to as the “trait” fatigue, whereas fatigability is referred to as a “state” feature of fatigue. In a clinical setting, the two aspects are usually measured jointly using standardized scales [ – ]. 

The precise mechanisms that determine the emergence and magnitude of effort-independent “state” fatigue and effort-evoked “trait” fatigability in a given patient are still largely unknown and treatment remains a challenge [ ]. Whatever the causal mechanisms may be, the experience of excessive fatigue and fatigability are underpinned by pathophysiological changes in functional brain networks [ ]. Identifying brain activity that scales with the experience of fatigue and fatigability during everyday life may not only reveal important insights into the pathophysiology of fatigue, but may be a step towards establishing neuroimaging-based biomarkers of fatigue that can supplement the subjective clinical scores. 

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used in patients with MS to link task-related brain activity patterns to subjectively experienced fatigue during everyday life, yet results have been relatively incongruent across studies [ – ]. This can be attributed to the fact that MS is a heterogeneous disease and most studies examined relatively few patients. Additionally, there are several methodological differences in the studies, e.g. regarding the experimental tasks, the MS phenotypes, age range, disease-related disability (i.e. as reflected by EDSS scores), disease durations, fatigue questionnaires, etc. Only a couple of the studies share some common ground regarding the fatigue related brain activation changes [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Specogna et al. [ ] acquired fMRI, while patients performed a self-paced, sequential, thumb-to-finger opposition task. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) [ ]. In fatigued patients with a score above 5, task-induced fatigue was associated with stronger task-related activity in right middle frontal gyrus, dorsal premotor cortex and putamen compared to non-fatigued patients with a score below 4 [ ]. Pardini et al. [ ] studied mildly affected patients, while they performed an acoustically paced, sequential thumb-to-finger opposition task twice per second. None of the patients perceived the task as fatiguing. Using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale as index of fatigue (MFIS) during everyday life [ ], a positive correlation was found between experienced fatigue and task-related activity in right motor cerebellum (lobule VI) as well as orbitofrontal cortex [ ]. In another fMRI study, mildly disabled patients and healthy controls made repetitive finger flexion–extension movements [ ]. Healthy controls showed a linear increase in task-related activity across task blocks in right and left putamen, and left precentral cortex [ ]. This time-dependent linear increase in activity was reduced in patients who suffered from fatigue [ ]. In a recent fMRI study, 14 MS patients performed an acoustically paced, sequential thumb-to-finger opposition task with their right hand twice per second to test fatigability by evoking effort-induced fatigue [ ]. Among other parts of the basal ganglia, patients recruited the putamen already at the beginning of the task before fatigability arose [ ]. This initial activation differs from the activity pattern found in healthy subjects [ ]. Healthy subjects recruited the putamen first after continuous task performance had induced a state of fatigue, but not at the beginning of task performance [ ]. Furthermore, other fMRI tasks have been used to study neural correlates of fatigue in MS such as stress or reward-processing tasks [ ,  ]. 

This current study took a new step in the search of the pathophysiological changes in functional brain networks related to fatigue in a well-defined group of MS patients. Extending previous fMRI studies, we chose a tonic precision grip task as sensorimotor paradigm, because this task required the continuous integration of visual and somatosensory input with the generated motor output to maintain the required target force level [ ]. We reasoned that the nature of the task would engage sensorimotor control regions that contribute to motor fatigue in MS. We performed whole-brain fMRI to further clarify the relation between sensorimotor brain activity during a non-fatiguing sensorimotor task and the amount of motor fatigue and fatigability experienced during everyday life. Since previous fMRI studies of repetitive finger movements pointed to an alteration of task-related activity in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), motor cerebellum, and putamen [ ,  ,  ,  ], we defined these areas as region of interest. We expected that patients suffering from motor fatigue and fatigability in their everyday life would display overall differences in task-related recruitment or differences in the time-dependent modulation of task-related activity levels in these areas. We further hypothesized that task-related activity in the ROIs would reflect the amount of motor fatigue and fatigability that patients experience during daily activities. 


## Material and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
50 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 25 healthy individuals were initially included in the study. Inclusion criteria were age between 18 to 55 years and right-handedness according to Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ]. Patients had to have a maximal Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 3.5 and to be attack-free and on same treatment for the last three months. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, contraindication for MRI, pharmacological treatment of fatigue, medical or psychiatric comorbidity, history of infection, sleeping problems, drug, or alcohol abuse. Approval was given by the Ethics committee of the Capital Region of Denmark (Protocol H-4-2013-182) and written informed consent was obtained before inclusion in the study. 


### Clinical assessment 
  
Self-reported fatigue was assessed with the Danish validated version of the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC) [ ,  ]. The questionnaire has been developed to assess the subjective experience of fatigue in MS patients during normal day-to-day life in general. The questions capture both, effort-independent “trait” fatigue and effort-dependent “state” fatigue (i.e., fatigability). The questionnaire has a motor subscale and a cognitive subscale and gives three measures of fatigue: an overall score, a motor score and a cognitive score ranging from 20–100 and 10–50, respectively. There is a high correlation between the cognitive and motor sub-scale of the questionnaire [ ]. Since the focus of this study was on the motor component of fatigue and fatigability, only the motor sub-score of the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC ) was considered and used to quantify the magnitude of motor fatigue and fatigability experienced during everyday life. Based on the individual FSMC  score, patients were divided into patients with fatigue (score ≥ 27) and patients without fatigue (FSMC  score ≥ 27) and patients without fatigue (score ≥ 27) and patients without fatigue (FSMC  score < 27) corresponding to the cut-off point for moderate motor fatigue [ ]. Overall disease-related disability was assessed with the EDSS [ ]. Skilled hand function was quantified with the Nine Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) [ ] and Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT) [ ]. The severity of depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment, sleep problems were assessed with well-established tests or questionnaires such as the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) [ ,  ], Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT) [ ], Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) [ ], Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) [ ,  ], and Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Index (PQSI) [ ]. 


### Magnetic resonance imaging 
  
Whole-brain MRI was performed with an Achieva 3 Tesla scanner and a 32-channel head coil (Philips, Best, The Netherlands). Blood oxygen level dependent fMRI [ ] was acquired using Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) with a repetition time (TR) of 2500 ms, echo time (TE) of 30 ms and flip-angle of 80°. Each brain volume consisted of 42 axial slices acquired in interleaved order with a slice-thickness of 3 mm and 3x3x3 mm voxel resolution, covering a field-of-view (FOV) of 192x192x126 mm. Whole-brain fMRI was acquired throughout three phases, a pre-fatigue phase, a fatigue induction phase, and a post-fatigue induction phase. This paper is only using the fMRI data, which were acquired in the pre-fatigue phase, corresponding to the first 201 acquired brain volumes of the fMRI session. The fatigue induction phase was variable across subjects due to the individual differences in fatigability and lasted from 39 seconds to 494 seconds and was used to induce motor fatigue in the subjects. The post-fatigue phase was similar to the pre-fatigue phase, so the total duration of the fMRI scan was between 19.3 minutes and 28.5 minutes (including pauses in between the different phases). Here we will only report the results from the first pre-fatigue phase, results for the two other phases will be presented elsewhere. 

Structural MRI scans were additionally acquired to measure lesion load and brain atrophy and included a three-dimensional high-resolution T1-weighted image acquired with a sagittal magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TR = 6 ms, TE = 2.70 ms; flip-angle = 8°, 0.85 mm isotropic voxel size, FOV = 245x245x208 mm). A T2-weighted image was acquired with a turbo spin echo sequence (TR = 2500 ms, TE = 270 ms; flip-angle = 90°, 0.85 mm isotropic voxel size, FOV = 245x245x190 mm) and a fluid attenuated inversion recovery image (FLAIR) (TR = 4800 ms, TE = 327ms, 1 mm isotropic voxel size, FOV = 256x256x202 mm). We also performed diffusion weighted MRI of the brain, which will be reported separately. 


### Tonic grip force task during fMRI 
  
Detailed oral and written task instructions were given and the subjects were familiarized with the task before fMRI. Participants were holding a force sensitive device with their right hand using a pincer grip and produced a steady force level, which was individually adjusted to 20% of their maximal force. The force produced by the participant was continuously visualized as expanding circle on a screen. The circle had to match the size of a ring, which indicated the target force level ( ). To avoid fatigue, alternating 20-s task blocks, during which subjects produced a force level at 20% of individual maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), alternated with 20-s periods of rest. Performance was continuously monitored on a screen in the MRI control room. The acquired grip force data was scaled to reflect force in Newton and the mean and standard deviation of the applied force were extracted using Matlab (The Mathworks Inc., USA,  ). 
   The precision grip task and parametric modulation.  
 (A)   The tonic precision grip task consisted of 12 task blocks (each 20 s) alternated by periods of rest (20 s). During the grip task, visual feedback of the exerted grip force (blue area) and the required target force (grey circle) was continuously provided.   (B)   Participants had to maintain a target force corresponding to 20% of the individual maximal voluntary contraction and the grip force output was continuously recorded.   (C)   Task-related activity was analysed using a General Linear Model in which the constant main effect of task (main effect) as well as linear modulation of task-related activity (linear time effect) were modelled. Task-related activation during the first block (red line) was separately modelled and treated as effect of no interest. 
  

### Pre-processing and analysis of MRI data 
  
Lesions were automatically delineated on the FLAIR images using Jim software (JIM version 6.0 Xinapse System, Leicester, UK,  ). The delineated lesions were checked and if necessary, corrected by an expert using the co-registered T2- and T1-weighted images as support. The individual subject’s T1-weighted image was normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM 12, Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK,  ) and the normalization warp was then applied to the lesion mask. The normalized lesion masks were then summed across subjects to form a lesion frequency image in MNI space. 

Structural reconstruction and volumetric segmentation of structural MRIs were performed with FreeSurfer software (version 5.3.0;  ) using a standard processing pipeline [ ,  ], which includes intensity normalization to MNI space, skull stripping, filtering, segmentation, and surface deformation. To increase the segmentation accuracy for the patients, the semi-automated lesion delineations were entered into FreeSurfer as white matter hypointensity (on T1w) voxels in the segmentation pipeline [ ]. Quality of the skull stripping and accuracy of grey and white matter outer boundaries were reviewed by a trained researcher. The volumetric data of estimated total intracranial volume (TIV), white matter volume (WMV), and grey matter volume (GMV) were extracted using specialized FreeSurfer tools for automated parcellation of grey and white matter [ ]. The extracted volume measures were transformed into z-scores for further analyses. 

The fMRI data were analysed using SPM 12. Images were realigned to the mean EPI image using a six-parameter, rigid-body transformation and spatial normalized to the MNI ICMB European brain template, using the mean realigned image to determine the transformation. The images were resampled to 2x2x2 mm3 voxels in MNI space and smoothed with a 6 mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel. For each participant, a general linear model (GLM) was used to model the fMRI time series. The design matrix modelled task-related activation as a boxcar function reflecting the alternation of task and rest periods convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. A second regressor modelled the first-order (linear) modulation of task-related BOLD signal changes across the session orthogonalized to the main task regressor [ ]. The design matrix included additional 24 nuisance regressors derived from the realignment parameters [ ] and a regressor-of-no-interest for the first block of the tonic precision grip task during which subjects reached steady-state performance. 


### Statistical analyses 
  
Group analysis of the fMRI data employed random effects analysis to test for voxel-wise significance within and between groups, yielding mean statistical parametric maps for each group and for between-group difference using one-sample and two-sample T-tests, respectively. The group models for within and between group analyses contained the FSMC  score as effect of interest, and the two nuisance regressors “age” and “hand function” measured with the JTHFT. Separate group models were set up for the main effect of task and the first-order modulation of task-related activation during the session. 

Group analyses tested for differences in task-related activity between healthy controls and patients with MS as well as differences between patients with excessive fatigue (FMS group) and patients without fatigue (NFMS group). In the latter analysis, individual BDI-II scores were included as a covariate in the model to isolate the effect of fatigue from those associated with the presence of depressive symptoms. 

The correction for multiple non-independent comparisons at the peak voxel level was performed using the family-wise error method implemented in SPM based on Gaussian random fields and the statistical threshold was set to p < 0.05. A single mask consisting of the cerebellum lobule VI, putamen, and PMd of both hemispheres were used to define the region of interest ( ). The PMd ROI was defined based on the Human Motor Area Template (HMAT) number 9 and 10 [ ] converted from Talairach to MNI space with tal2mni ( ). The putamen ROI was defined with the Automated Anatomic Labelling Atlas (AAL) [ ]. The cerebellar lobule VI was defined with the probabilistic MRI cerebellum atlas by Diedrichsen et al. [ ]. For voxels within the ROI, small volume correction was applied considering all voxels within the ROI mask. In addition, we used the lesion frequency map to exclude voxels, which was labelled as a lesion voxel in one or more patients, which was done to restrict the analysis to non-lesion brain tissue. For descriptive purposes, all group statistical parametric maps used an uncorrected, cluster-forming threshold of p < 0.001.

Clinical, behavioural and structural MRI measures are given as mean (± standard deviation) and were analysed with SPSS software (version 22, IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA), using repeated measures ANOVA, t-tests and Pearson or Spearman correlation when appropriate. Significance threshold was set at p < 0.05. 



## Results 
  
### Clinical and grip force data 
  
Forty-nine of the 50 patients underwent MRI scanning, but three fMRI data sets could not be used because of motion artefacts or insufficient task compliance. Two additional patients were excluded because of high BDI-II scores. In these two patients, the total BDI-II score indicated the presence of severe symptoms of depression, although these patients had no clinical diagnosis of depression. Thus, 44 MS patients (27 FMS patients and 17 NFMS patients) and 25 healthy controls were included in the group analyses. Clinical characteristics and group data of the structural MRI analyses are summarized in  . Healthy controls and the MS patients had comparable age and sex distributions. Patients had higher total, motor, and cognitive FSMC scores than healthy controls. Patients also had significantly higher average BDI-II, PQSI, and JTHFT scores than healthy controls. 
   Clinical characteristics of MS patients and healthy controls.        
In the patient group, individual FSMC  scores showed a positive correlation with BDI-II scores (r = 0.53, p < 0.001) and EDSS scores (r = 0.47, p = 0.001). The individual FSMC  scores did not correlate with disease duration or total white matter lesion volume. Accordingly, the FMS group had higher BDI-II and EDSS scores than the NFMS patients, while other clinical scores did not differ significantly between the two groups ( ). TIV and GMV were higher in the NFMS group than in the FMS group ( ). 
   Clinical characteristics of the MS patients.        
Patients performed the precision grip task equally well as healthy controls during fMRI. Mean grip force was 16.17 (±4.67) N in healthy controls and 16.20 (±2.40) N in MS patients. The mean variability across subjects of the applied force was 0.54 (±0.80) N in healthy controls and 0.52 (±0.31) N in patients. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed no time or group effect and no interaction between time and group for mean force levels and the variability or grip force during the task. 


### Task-related activity during tonic grip force task 
  
#### Task-related activation 
  
The tonic grip force task activated a well-known sensorimotor network that has been shown to be engaged in visually guided control of precision grip force [ ]. The network comprised cortical clusters in the prefrontal, premotor, sensorimotor, parietal and occipital cortex, as well as cerebellum and basal ganglia bilaterally. The task-related activity pattern was very similar in both groups with no significant between-group differences in task-related activation between MS and healthy controls ( ) or between the FMS and NFMS groups.

#### Relation between task-related activation and motor fatigue 
  
Patients with MS showed a linear relationship between task-related activation and individual FSMC  scores in the right upper cerebellar lobule VI ( ). The cerebellar cluster was located in the hand motor representation ipsilateral to the hand performing the task ( ), indicating that cerebellar task-related activity scaled positively with the magnitude of self-reported motor fatigue and fatigability during everyday life. No linear relationship between individual fatigue scores and task-related cerebellar activity was found in healthy controls.

     Group results of the fMRI data.        
We divided the patient group in patients with fatigue (FMS group) and without fatigue (NFMS group). When comparing these groups, we found regional differences in the scaling between task-related activity and FSMC  scores in two clusters within the left PMd, peaking at MNI-coordinates x, y, z = -30, 4, 46 and x, y, z = -26, -12, 74 ( ). In these PMd regions, NFMS patients who did not experience excessive motor fatigue during everyday life showed a linear increase in task-related activation with the magnitude of experienced motor fatigue ( ). This relationship between task-related activity and FSMC  scores was absent in FMS patients who reported excessive levels of motor fatigue ( ). The same pattern was found in a cluster in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) rostral to the pre-supplementary area. Here task-related activity scaled positively with individual FSMC  scores in the NFMS group, but not in the FMS group ( ).

(A  ) The left ventral part of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) (p  = 0.017),   (B)   left caudal part of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) (p  = 0.049) and   (C)   left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) showed increased linear correlation between task-related activation and FSMC  scores in the non-fatigued MS patients (blue) compared with the fatigued MS patients (red) (p  = 0.038). 
  

#### Linear changes in activation during repeated task performance 
  
Compared to patients with MS, healthy controls showed a stronger time-dependent increase in task-related activity in the right posterior cingulate cortex and adjacent lingual gyrus ( ). Conversely, patients showed no brain region where task-related activation increased more strongly with time than in healthy controls. We also found no differences in time-dependent task modulation between the FMS and NFMS groups. 

Considering only the patients with MS, we found a negative linear effect of time on task-related activity in the motor territory of the left cerebellum contralateral to the hand performing the grip force task ( ). In contrast, no brain region showed a significant linear increase or decrease in task-related activity with the duration of task performance in healthy controls. 

A correlation analysis between the individual FSMC  scores and the task-related brain activity revealed a difference in the linear time-dependent modulation of task-related activity ( ). In right caudal PMd, the time-dependent increase in task-related activity scaled more strongly with the individual FSMC  scores in healthy controls than in patients with MS ( ). The higher the individual FSMC  scores, the stronger the time-dependent increase of task-related PMd activity in healthy controls, but not in MS patients ( ). The same pattern was found in a rostromedial cluster of the left cerebellum and lingual gyrus. When each group was tested separately, the relationship between time-dependent modulation of PMd activity and FSMC  scores did not reach significance. 
   MS patients compared to healthy controls.  
MS patients’ task-related activity scaled with individual FSMC  scores relatively to the scaling in healthy controls. Healthy controls showed a stronger time-dependent increase in task-related activity in the right dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) than patients with MS (p  = 0.031). In healthy controls, the linear time modulation of task scaled with the individual FSMC  scores (blue). The more controls experienced fatigue during daily life; the more they displayed a linear increase in task-related activity with time during the non-fatiguing grip force task. This relationship was not present in MS patients (red). 
  
There were no clusters in the brain where the time-dependent increase in task-related activity correlated more strongly with FSMC  scores in MS patients than in controls. There was also no influence of the FSMC  scores on time-dependent activity changes, when contrasting FMS and NFMS patients. 




## Discussion 
  
Here we used task-related fMRI to map sensorimotor brain activity evoked by a tonic right-hand grip force task in mildly impaired patients with MS and healthy controls. We identified distinct regions in the cerebellum and premotor cortex where sensorimotor activity in the non-fatigued state scaled with the amount of motor fatigue that patients experienced during everyday life. Task-related activity in right motor cerebellum increased in proportion with self-reported fatigue. Furthermore, patients lacked a “normal” upscaling of regional task-related activity in premotor and dorsomedial prefrontal areas with the level of subjectively experienced fatigue. As pointed out above, self-reported “motor fatigue”, as probed with the FSMC  or other standardized clinical scales, reflects both effort-independent “trait” fatigue as well as effort-induced “state” fatigue (i.e., fatigability) [ – ]. 

### Cerebellar activity and self-experienced fatigue 
  
The right motor cerebellum ipsilateral to the grasping hand was the only brain region, where functional activation during a non-fatiguing tonic grip force task scaled significantly with the amount of experienced motor fatigue in patients with MS ( ). This finding confirms and extends previous fMRI studies on fatigue in MS. In 14 mildly affected patients with relapsing-remitting MS, subjective fatigue during everyday life correlated positively with task-related activation of the right cerebellar lobule VI ipsilateral to the moving hand [ ]. In that study, patients had to generate externally paced finger-to-thumb opposition sequences with their right hand at a rate of 2 Hz during fMRI. A possible correlate at the metabolic level has also been reported in a study using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [ ]. Likewise, an early fMRI study reported a stronger overall activation of the right motor cerebellum in mildly impaired MS patients suffering from fatigue as opposed to those without fatigue, when patients performed flexion–extension finger movements with their right hand at a paced rate of 1 Hz [ ]. In summary, our and previous fMRI studies consistently show across a range of non-fatiguing manual tasks, that task-related activation of the sensorimotor cerebellum reflects how much fatigue patients experience during their everyday live. 

Functional and structural changes in the cerebellum contribute significantly to disease-induced motor disability in MS [ ,  ] as well as to cognitive and emotional disturbances [ ]. The motor cerebellum is involved in the detection of motor errors and their correction during on-going movements and motor learning [ ,  ] and secures temporal and spatial precision and fluency of movements based on internal models [ ,  ]. Accordingly, in addition to individual fatigue scores, the temporal accuracy of repetitive finger movements correlated positively with the activity in right cerebellar lobule VI and temporal accuracy during the task correlated positively with the self-reported fatigue in the study by Pardini et al. [ ]. This ‘‘fatigue-motor performance paradox” prompted Pardini et al. to propose that patients who experience fatigue may be the ones who excessively monitor their errors to optimize performance [ ]. In other words, scaling-up cerebellar sensorimotor control might be a compensatory mechanism to secure good performance but at the same time cause fatigue. Excessive sensorimotor processing in the cerebellum may lead to a faster exhaustion of neural resources, and thereby promote effort-induced experience of fatigue. Given that the cerebellum plays an important role in a range of non-motor functions [ ], a similar consideration may apply for non-motor aspects of fatigue and altered processing in other non-motor territories in the cerebellum. 

The increase in cerebellar motor activity with increasing individual fatigue scores was found during both tonic motor activity in the present study and phasic repetitive activity in the study by Pardini et al. [ ]. The sensorimotor task employed by Pardini et al. [ ] required temporal error processing to optimize the timing of finger movements relative to an auditory pacing cue. In contrast, the sensorimotor task used in the present study engaged the processing of magnitude errors in force output based on the simultaneous visual display of the exerted force and the target force. Although the two tasks implicated different types of error processing, they both required the continuous integration of external target signals with sensory feedback created by the motor output. Both sensorimotor settings revealed a positive relationship between task-related motor activation of ipsilateral cerebellar lobule VI and self-reported magnitude of fatigue, supporting the notion that the motor cerebellum excessively monitors performance during relatively simple motor tasks that has yet not induced fatigability. 

In the left sensorimotor cerebellum contralateral to the grasping hand, patients displayed a time-dependent linear decrease in task-related activity during the fMRI session ( ). In addition, the time-dependent linear increase in task-related activity in the rostromedial part of the left motor cerebellum scaled more strongly with the individual FSMC  scores in healthy controls than in patients with MS. The higher the individual FSMC  scores, the stronger was the time-dependent increase of task-related cerebellum activity during the fMRI session in healthy controls, but not in MS patients. This finding indicates that not only the constant level of ipsilateral cerebellar sensorimotor activation, but also the lack of temporal modulation of contralateral cerebellar activity during continued task performance may be related to motor fatigue experienced during everyday life. 


### Premotor activity and self-experienced fatigue 
  
The premotor cortex forms multiple reciprocal loops with the parietal cortex, through which sensory information is processed and transformed into actions [ – ]. The PMd is a key region for manual motor control and is involved in response selection and non-routine visuo–motor mapping [ – ]. PMd participates both in motor planning and execution [ ], displaying a rostro-caudal functional gradient with the more caudal part being associated more closely with motor execution [ ,  ,  ]. 

In accordance with our hypothesis, several clusters in PMd showed an altered activation profile in patients with MS that change in proportion with the amount of motor fatigue experienced during daily life. In the caudal part of right PMd, patients and controls showed differences in the linear time-dependent modulation of task-related activity during the fMRI session, which scaled linearly with the individual FSMC  scores. In the right caudal PMd, healthy controls showed a stronger time-dependent increase of task-related activity with the experienced magnitude of motor fatigue than MS patients ( ). This difference between groups suggests that healthy individuals gradually increase task-related recruitment of the PMd during repeated task blocks, the more they experience fatigue during daily life. Of note, none of the healthy controls reported a level of fatigue that was of clinical relevance. Hence, the relationship found in healthy controls between the time-dependent modulation of PMd activity and the FSMC  scores applies to normal inter-individual variations in the physiological range. One might speculate that the ability to recruit the right PMd during continuous task performance might protect against the occurrence of excessive fatigue or fatigability. 

The positive relationship between the temporal modulation of PMd activity and experienced daily-life fatigue was absent in the patient group, even though patients showed a wider inter-individual spread and overall higher FSMC  scores. Using a non-fatiguing hand flexion-extension task, a recent fMRI study found that MS patients suffering from fatigue showed a reduced activation change over time in left putamen and precentral gyrus compared to healthy controls [ ]. Our results extend the findings showing a deficient time-dependent task-related activation over time in the right caudal PMd the more patients experienced motor fatigue during daily life. In addition, the comparison of the FMS and NFMS groups revealed that overall task-related activity in a ventral cluster and a caudal cluster of left PMd depended on the presence of motor fatigue during daily life ( ). In these left-hemispheric clusters, task-related activity scaled differentially with the magnitude of fatigue in the FMS groups relative to the NFMS group. NFMS patients, who had FSMC  scores close to the normal range, showed a linear increase in task-related activation of left PMd with their individual FSMC  scores. In contrast, FMS patients, who had abnormally high FSMC  scores, showed a linear decrease or no change in task-related activation depending on their individual FSMC  scores. In agreement with our findings, Specogna et al. [ ] found stronger task-related activity in a ventral cluster of the left PMd during a self-paced sequential finger-tapping task in NFMS patients relative to healthy controls. This increase in task-related premotor activation was not present in MS patients with fatigue [ ]. The results suggest a link between the inability of task-related PMd recruitment and the daily experience of motor fatigue in patients with MS. The NFMS group upscaled task-related activation of PMd, the more patients experienced signs of motor fatigue during everyday life. Conversely, the FMS group failed to up-scaled the task-related activation of PMd with the increasing severity of daily-life motor fatigue. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that patients who suffer from motor fatigue may fail to gradually upscale task-related engagement of PMd. The inability to sufficiently recruit PMd during prolonged performance of non-fatiguing motor tasks might reflect deficient sensorimotor integration within the PMd and contribute to abnormal fatigability during daily activities. 


### No consistent abnormality of task-related activity of the putamen 
  
The putamen was the only pre-defined region of interest where we found no significant alteration of the regional activation profile in relation to fatigue. This negative finding may be related to the nature of the task, which did not rely critically on the basal ganglia, but rather on cerebellar integration of the produced motor output and the visual and somatosensory input to produce a constant force output. Other motor tasks, for instance tasks that require repetitive or sequential movements, might reveal altered activity patterns in the basal ganglia that are related to motor fatigue in MS as seen in other studies [ ,  ]. 


### Motivational drive and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex 
  
The left dorsomedial part of the prefrontal cortex showed a difference in task-related activation in the patient group depending on whether patients suffered from excessive fatigue or not. Patients without fatigue showed a positive relationship between task-related dmPFC activity and their individual FSMC  scores, whereas patients with motor fatigue did not show this pattern ( ). In the FMS group, dmPFC activity did not change in proportion with the magnitude of self-reported motor fatigue. In accordance with our finding, a recent task-related fMRI study reported reduced activation of dmPFC in FMS patients compared to NFMS patients and HC during a repetitive extension-flexion task [ ]. 

Furthermore, a fMRI study in healthy individuals has identified a motivational action control circuit that secures consistent force production “despite changes in emotional context” and includes the dmPFC, PMv and PMd [ ]. The study showed that dmPFC and PMv increase task-related activity during a visually cued phasic grip task, when the task context is emotionally salient [ ]. Additional connectivity analysis revealed a stronger functional coupling of dmPFC with ventral and dorsal portions of premotor cortex in an emotionally salient versus a neutral context. In present study, we find that the more severe motor fatigue the patients are experiencing, the more the task-related activity was downscaled in left dmPFC and PMd. Taking into account the work by Coombes et al. (2012) in healthy individuals, we speculate that a downscaling of dmPFC and PMd activity may point to a dysfunction of the motivational action control circuit in MS patients who suffer from motor fatigue, reducing the internal motivational drive. 


### Methodological considerations and limitations of this study 
  
The FSMC questionnaire has been developed to assess fatigue in MS and requests the subject to evaluate how much they experience an extreme form of tiredness (fatigue) i.e. the “overwhelming state of lethargy, exhaustion and lack of energy which comes on abruptly and is unrelated to any obvious external causes” during their day-to-day life [ ]. Hence, the questionnaire probes the subjective experience of fatigue during day-to-day life in general rather than the momentary expression of fatigue at the time of examination. The questionnaire contains items that capture effort-independent “trait” fatigue as well as effort-related “state” fatigue (i.e., fatigability). Since we used the FSMC  score as proxy for motor fatigue in this study, it is impossible to disentangle whether the brain activation changes are related to “trait” fatigue, fatigability and/or an interaction between the two. Furthermore, it remains controversial whether”trait” fatigue and “state” fatigability can be dissociated [ ]. While fMRI can help to pinpoint abnormal patterns of regional brain activations related to motor fatigue in MS, fMRI provides no insights into the specific neurobiological mechanisms through which MS gives rise to these functional activation changes [ ]. Furthermore, whether these brain activation changes are a response, cause or mediator of fatigue cannot be inferred from the present study. This question may be tackled with an interventional study design in which the amount of fatigue or the activation patterns are altered by a targeted intervention (e.g. pharmacological therapy or focal brain stimulation). 

The present study deliberately focussed on relatively mildly affected patients with a relapsing-remitting presentation of MS. Therefore the generalizability to other clinical forms of MS such as primary or secondary progressive MS or more severely impaired patient groups is limited. 

We used a visual-spatial grip force control task to study neural correlates of motor fatigue in sensorimotor brain networks. While the focus was on the motor component of fatigue, the motor and cognitive subscales of the FSMC questionnaire were highly correlated in our sample, in agreement with the literature [ ]. Therefore, it remains unclear how much the present findings are really specific to motor aspects of fatigue or generalize to the cognitive domain. 

In addition, the task did not activate motor networks implicated in the control of other motor effectors such as legs (gait) or mouth (speech and swallowing). The relatively simple task also did not capture the physical and mental challenges of skilled manipulative actions during everyday life. This implies that the present findings need to be interpreted in the context of the specific motor task and generalization to other motor tasks should be made with caution. Another inherent limitation is that MS leads to motor impairment, and the effects of motor impairment on task-related activation may confound the activation patterns related to motor fatigue. However, we consider it highly unlikely that the present findings were accounted for by disease-related impairment of hand function. Inter-individual differences in hand function were taken into account in our statistical model. In contrast to task-related fMRI, resting state fMRI has the advantage of not being confounded be type of task type or task performance. 

Patients and healthy controls performed the grip force task equally well during the fMRI session, and there were no between-group differences in task-related brain activation. However, the results of this study are limited by the lack of controlling for regional lesion burden. 

Finally, it is generally accepted that fatigue and depression constitute two different but closely related conditions [ ]. This results in an inherent problem when studying fatigue, as patients rating high on a fatigue questionnaire will also score high on a depression rating scale, even when excluding patients with a clinical diagnosis of major depression. In this study, to make sure the differences in brain activation was not biased by depression none of the patients had a clinical diagnosis of depression, patients with high BDI scores indicative of severe depressive symptoms were excluded and the comparison between the NFMS and FMS group was corrected for depression. 



## Conclusions 
  
The present study advances the current understanding of the neural underpinnings of fatigue in MS. We show that the functional activation of the motor cerebellum during a non-fatiguing tonic grip force task reflects the severity of motor fatigue and fatigability experienced during daily life. In dorsal and ventral premotor as well as dorsomedial prefrontal areas, inter-individual difference in task-related activation scaled with the level of experienced fatigue during everyday life. MS patients showed a reduced upscaling of task-related activity in this prefrontal-premotor network, the more the patients were affected by motor fatigue. In summary, the results are compatible with the notion that motor fatigue in MS is associated with an upscaling of cerebellar sensorimotor integration along with a downscaling of motivational drive and sensorimotor processing in prefrontal and premotor areas. However, whether these brain activation changes are a response, a cause or a mediator of fatigue cannot be concluded.

# Abstract
  Background/Objective  
In this study we explored the neuroimaging characteristics of persons with specific small animal (cockroach) phobia to determine whether there are differences in cerebral activity between persons with and without cockroach phobia under conditions of phobic and non-phobic stimulation.   Method  : 24 adult persons (12 with phobia) were studied. The diagnosis of phobia was obtained with a structured interview and questionnaires. All participants were exposed to a 3D video presentation during an fMRI session.   Results  : The phobic group showed significant differential activations that were congruent with a dual route model of fear processing through the thalamus-amygdala (route I) and the thalamus-sensory and association cortex-entorhinal cortex-hippocampus-subiculum-amygdala (route II). Apart from this dual route, we also found differential activations in the globus pallidum, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, pars orbitalis, triangularis and opercularis of the frontal cortex, and cerebellum. Respect to non-phobic group, no activations were found in the insula or the anterior cingulate cortex.   Conclusions  : There seems to be a dual route depending on how persons with phobia to cockroaches process phobic stimuli. This double processing can have implications for the psychological treatment of specific phobias. 
 

# Body
 
Neuroimaging studies of patients with mental disorders have been conducted with the main aim of providing evidence of the neurological bases of such diseases. Such knowledge is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the neuropsychological mechanisms of psychopathology and consequently to the improvement of psychological and biological treatments ( ;  ). Phobias are a type of anxiety disorder and refer to a high persistent anxiety response that people usually (but not always) consider excessive or irrational to the presence or anticipation of a threatening object or situation (American Psychiatric Association,  ). According to the APA, three groups of phobias (i.e., agoraphobia, social phobia, and specific phobias) are the most prevalent mental disorders overall. Of these, specific phobias have the highest prevalence rates, which range from 7% to 12.1% ( ;  ).   pointed out that small animal phobia is one of the most disabling phobias because there is a possibility of encountering the animal in everyday life. According to these authors, 40% of specific phobias are phobias of small animals. 

As shown by systematic reviews ( ,  ) and meta-analyses ( ;  ), neuroimaging studies of phobias have found a group of similar brain areas and circuits to be related to brain responses to phobic stimuli. The areas most often found are those associated with limbic and paralimbic structures. The amygdala (especially the left amygdala) is the brain structure that has been found to be most closely associated with specific phobia in several studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, other brain areas have also been found to be activated by phobic stimuli. Such is the case of the left insula, cingulate gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and orbitofrontal cortex ( ;  ;  ;  ). 

The differences between those studies illustrate the complexity of neurological processes in phobias. However, the differences found may also be due to the methodological characteristics of those studies. In fact, studies differ from one another in many ways. A few examples are the use of clinical or subclinical samples, the type of phobia, age, gender, the presence or absence of a control comparative group, and procedural differences. In this regard, not all studies used the same type of fMRI machine. Despite commercial differences, most of the studies used 1.5 T machines. Machines with higher spatial resolution such as the one used in this study–3 T–allow a better delimitation of the brain structures detected and may explain some slight differences found between studies. There may also be specific effects depending on whether participants are shown pictures or a video presentation. 

Considering the above, a more refined meta-analysis was performed of studies including an fMRI procedure whose participants included persons with small animal phobia and a healthy control group. The left amygdala and insular cortex were the brain areas found to be associated with the presence of phobic stimuli. Other structures involved in phobic responses were the fusiform gyrus, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the left cingulate cortex. Overall, this review found that the role of frontal areas seemed to be less stable than that of limbic areas ( ). Considering the findings of the above-mentioned review, the aim of the present study was to provide data about brain activation in individuals with specific phobia (i.e., cockroach phobia). To do so, we intended to compare a group of persons with cockroach phobia to a control group of individuals without phobia. The fMRI was performed while participants watched a 3D video presentation of the stimuli, cockroaches moving around, to enhance the sensation of presence. This study was designed with these methodological requirements in order to avoid the heterogeneity of data obtained in previous studies. Apart from taking into account patients’ treatment preferences ( ), as   pointed out, a multi-method approach is needed to increase the accuracy in selecting the best psychological treatment. In this regard, knowing which nuclei of the brain are related to fear can be a predominant step to improve the strategies aimed at eliminating its pathological learning ( ). 

## Method 
  
### Participants 
  
The sample was composed of 24 adults, of whom 12 had cockroach phobia and 12 did not have any phobias. Each of these two groups included eight female participants and four male participants. The mean age of phobic individuals was 40.08 years (  SD   11.96) and that of non-phobic individuals was 24.08 years (  SD   7.73). There was a significant difference between both groups in age (  F  (1)= 15.15;   p   = .001). All participants were right handed. For phobic individuals, we applied the following inclusion criteria: Being an adult with this type of phobia; the phobia had to be a primary psychological disorder and not be explained by another health condition, including another phobia or panic attack. The remaining inclusion criteria were not receiving any treatment for cockroach phobia, being right handed, having normal vision, and not having any impediment for a magnetic resonance imaging session. Non-phobic participants were recruited in a similar way among the students of the University of La Laguna in Tenerife, Spain. In this case, subjects obtained course credit in exchange for their participation. 


### Instruments 
  
In order to verify the diagnosis of phobia, we used the questions about phobias and panic disorder of the   Composite International Diagnostic Interview   (CIDI), Version 2.1 ( ). The CIDI is a structured interview for major mental disorders according to the CIE-10 criteria (World Health Organization,  ). For the purposes of this study, items/questions related to specific phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, and panic attack were selected. In addition, to verify whether participants met the inclusion criteria, a semi-structured interview was conducted asking for each specific criterion. Participants diagnosed with specific small animal phobia were included (F40.218;  ). The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and S-R Inventory of Anxiousness were administered as a complementary diagnosis. 

The HAM-A ( ) is a rating scale for clinicians developed to measure the severity of a patient's anxiety. It assesses 14 areas with a 5-point scale. It is a well-established scale ( ) with adequate psychometric properties, especially inter-rater reliability (interclass correlation coefficients ranged from .74 to .96;  ). In phobic participants, a score of 14 or higher was required. 

The S-R Inventory of Anxiousness ( ) is a 14-item inventory that assesses the most usual symptoms (physiological, cognitive, and behavioral) associated with the response to an anxious stimulus with a 5-point Likert scale. The evaluator points out the target phobic stimulus (in our case, cockroaches) prior to the participant's response. This instrument has high internal consistency (.95;  ) and adequate convergent validity ( ). 

Hand preference was assessed with the   Edinburgh Handedness Inventory   ( ). 

The nuclear magnetic resonance device used was a GE 3.0 T Signa Excite HD. Given that anxious participants could drop out of the study if they felt distress in the magnetic resonance device, an ASSET method (with 35 images with ang= 50°, TE= 2.1 ms, TR = 150 ms, 32 × 32 matrix and 6 mm slice width) was chosen to reduce time in the machine. Functional images were recorded with Gradient Echo (TR= 2000 ms, TE= 30 ms, FA = 75°, FOV = 25.6, Dim. Image = 64 × 64 × 32, Dim. Voxel = 4 × 4x4 mm). 


### Design 
  
A two-group experimental design was used ( ): phobic versus non-phobic individuals. Both groups were exposed to two different conditions: phobic stimuli (cockroaches) and neutral stimuli (wooden balls). Given that we used passive stimulation, a block design was used to present the stimuli in the magnetic resonance device. Each participant was randomly presented with 16 blocks of cockroach images and 16 blocks of images of wooden balls. The duration of each block was 20 seconds. All images had an identical white background. Participants were exposed to phobic and neutral stimuli in a stereoscopic 3D video with VisualStim digital MRI compatible 3D glasses (graphics card: GeForce 8600GT). 


### Procedure 
  
The study was conducted from April to July 2016. Phobic participants were recruited through various media (website, press, flyers, radio, TV, and newspapers), asking for persons with small animal phobia to participate in an fMRI research study. It was explained that after participating in the study, subjects would receive an eight-session psychological treatment for cockroach phobia. Once verifying participants met the inclusion criteria (through the interview and questionnaires), participants were asked to undergo the magnetic resonance test. Prior to that, they signed an informed consent protocol. All participants who met an initial diagnosis of specific phobia (according questionnaire scores), was corroborated by the semi-structure interview (only participants with no-removable metallic belongings, such as implants or devices, were excluded due its interference with fMRI analysis). Participant in non-phobic group were assessed with the same instruments in order to determine they did not meet the criteria for phobic disorder. 

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research and Animal Welfare of the University of La Laguna (ref. CEIBA2012-0033). 


### fMRI and data analysis 
  
Brain images were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 12) software. Pre-processing procedures included realigning, co-registering, segmenting (with forward deformation fields), normalizing (structural images with a 1 × 1x1 mm voxel size and functional images with a 4 × 4x4 mm voxel size), and smoothing (Gaussian Kernel of 8 mm, FWHM). Images were rendered and adjusted to the standard brain template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). In addition, the Xjview 8.14 package was used for neuroanatomic identification of active brain structures. 

As regards specific statistical analyses, a whole-brain study with hierarchized random effects was performed as a general linear model. Intra- and intergroup analyses were made by conducting   t  -test comparisons. Because there was a significant difference in age, the age variable was introduced as a vector in those analyses (as a covariate). 

As a conservative strategy, the Family-Wise Error (  p  <.05 FWE corrected) correction was used to assume when brain activation reached statistical significance. However, non-corrected probabilities were admitted when they were congruent with the biological model of phobias (but never higher than .005, uncorrected). With a voxel size of 4 × 4 × 4 mm, activations equal to or higher than a cluster size of 5 were selected. 



## Results 
  
In order to test for internal validity, preliminary ANOVAs were performed to compare the differences in anxiety and phobia scores between the phobic group (PhG) and the non-phobic control group (CG). In general anxiety (HAM-A scale), the PhG showed a mean (  M  ) of 18.25, with a standard deviation (  SD  ) of 10.18. The CG had a   M   = 0.67, and a   SD   = 1.37. The ANOVA yielded an   F  (1) = 35.15, which was statistically significant (  p   = .001). In the phobia score (S-R scale), the PhG had a M = 27.5 (  SD   = 7.88) and the CG had a   M   = 7.75 (  SD   = 5.88). This difference was also significant [  F  (1) = 48.42;   p   = .001]. These data show that the PhG had higher scores in anxiety and cockroach phobia than the CG. 

After testing for internal validity, the analyses were divided into two groups: First, we compared the brain activation of both the PhG and CG in the presence of phobic stimuli and neutral stimuli. Second, we compared the responses of the PhG and CG. 

### Phobic group 
  
In this section we describe the results in brain activation obtained by the PhG when phobic stimulation and neutral stimulation were compared. Data are summarized in  . These results correspond to the situation when phobic stimuli elicited a greater activation than neutral stimuli, because, as expected, participants did not show a greater activation in the presence of neutral stimuli compared to phobic stimuli.   
Differences in functional brain activation in phobic participants. A greater activation was recorded in the presence of phobic stimuli, with FWE corrected and uncorrected   p  -value. 
  Table 1     

As can be observed, differences in brain activation (i.e., phobic stimulation) were found in the thalamus, pulvinar nucleus, and amygdala; all areas were bilaterally activated). Differential activations were also detected in the superior occipital gyrus (bilateral), and inferior (left), left hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus (bilateral). Similar results were found for the cingulate gyrus: the posterior cingulate gyrus showed a bilateral activation but the anterior cingulate (and superior parietal) gyrus only showed activation on the left side. 

Two areas were activated on the right side: the fusiform gyrus and middle temporal gyrus. The insula had bilateral activation. The inferior frontal gyrus had a differential activation depending on the brain side: its pars triangularis and opercularis were activated on the right side. By contrast, the pars orbitalis showed activation in two areas on the right side and in one area on the left side. 

Finally,   shows the differences in both left inferior and left precentral circonvolutions, in the posterior part of the right medial frontal gyrus, in the globus pallidum, and in two areas of the left cerebellum. 


### Non-phobic group 
  
The initial results were similar to those of the phobic group but affected fewer brain areas. As shown on  , the thalamus, pulvinar nucleus, and amygdala were bilaterally activated by phobic stimuli. The inferior occipital gyrus (left), hippocampus (but only the right side), hippocampal gyrus (only left), and superior parietal lobule (only right) were also activated. The superior occipital gyrus was activated by phobic stimuli, but only on the right side and not bilaterally, as happened in the PhG; moreover, in the non-phobic group activation on the right side was observed in the inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis and opercularis) and fusiform gyrus. The precuneus was activated in this group but not in the phobic group.

### Differences between the phobic and non-phobic groups 
  
Given that a significant difference was found in age between both groups, the age variable was introduced as a covariate. No statistically significant results were found regarding the modulating role of age in the following results. For all dependent variables, there were not F value higher than   F  (1,20) = 14.82 (coefficient from which age could be considered to play a significant role). 

When both groups were compared in the phobic stimuli condition (see  ), the PhG showed a significantly higher activation in left side structures such as the thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, and inferior temporal gyrus. On the right side of the brain, a higher activation was observed in the parahippocampal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis), and middle temporal gyrus. The non-phobic group showed a higher significant activation in the left middle temporal gyrus.

  Table 3   

To illustrate the differential activations found between both groups,   shows standardized brain activations during phobic stimulation for the phobic and non-phobic groups. As can be observed, both groups produced an emotional activity responding to phobic stimuli. But PhG attained higher brain activity (more yellow colour). This higher hemodynamic response can be observed, practically, in all brain slices. Also, it can be observed a more bilaterally activation in phobic individuals.

## Discussion 
  
In this study we attempted to answer two questions about brain activation in specific phobia. We intended to explore the differences under phobic stimulation vs. non-phobic stimulation and the differences between phobic and non-phobic individuals under phobic stimulation. In order to obtain a sample with greater homogeneity than that of previous studies, cockroach phobia was selected as the specific phobia. In addition, to increase the realism of stimuli, a 3D video stimuli presentation was used. 

When we analyzed the brain responses of phobic individuals under phobic vs. neutral stimulation, we found a significant differential activation pattern that was consistent with previous data. The results obtained were congruent with a model of the existence of a two-route functional network in processing feared stimuli ( ,  ,  ). According to this model, the information related to emotional stimuli follows a dual route toward the amygdala: (i) a “short and non-conscious route” that involves a direct link between the thalamus and the amygdala; and (ii) a “long and conscious route” that involves the thalamus-sensory and association cortex-entorhinal cortex-hippocampus-subiculum-amygdala. Both routes are used by emotional responses to phobic stimuli, with their behavioral, cognitive, physiological, and endocrine components. 

In our study, individuals with phobia exhibited a differential bilateral activation of the thalamus that was greater on the left side and a differential activation of the amygdala (“short route”). In the “long route” we observed a differential activation of the superior and inferior occipital gyri (also detected by  ).   found that these areas were highly sensitive to emotional visual information. Moreover, the intense activation of the hippocampus (bilaterally) indicates a certain level of perceived threat ( ,  ). The pulvinar portion is associated with the integration of sensory stimulation and attention. Along with the amygdala, the anterior cingulate gyrus is also involved in fear processing (with awareness in the long route and without awareness in the short route) and response modulation ( ). In phobic individuals, the anterior cingulate gyrus is activated on the left side, while the posterior cingulate gyrus is bilaterally activated. These data are consistent with those reported by  , and  . By contrast,   found that the posterior cingulate gyrus was de-activated during differential conditioning. 

Apart from this   dual route  , the bilateral activation of the globus pallidum (a structure involved in movement regulation, inhibiting cerebellum impulses) has been found in other studies on specific phobias ( ,  ). The bilateral activaction of the parahippocampal gyrus–a memory area particularly associated to the coding and recognition of enviromental stimuli–has been found in the studies reviewed by  . The bilateral activation of the insula is associated with subjective distress in phobic individuals ( ) and conditioned fear ( ). 

The pars orbitalis, triangularis, and opercularis (inferior frontal cortex) exhibited a differential activation in the presence of phobic stimuli. These areas are involved in emotional regulation of phobias, generally according to the information received from the amygdala ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In addition,   found that areas such as the inferior frontal gyrus, parietal lobule, temporal areas, and anterior cingulate gyrus are involved in the inhibition of both cognitive and motor responses. This may suggest that the phobic participants in our study were inhibiting cognitions and escape behaviors in the presence of phobic stimuli. 

The cerebellum is a structure involved in the acquisition and expression of emotional associative learning that is directly related to fear behavior ( ;  ). Our data are consistent with previous studies that found activation of the cerebellum in response to phobic stimulation ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). 

When controls were exposed to phobic stimulation compared to neutral stimulation we also found activation in several similar brain areas, such as the thalamus, amygdala, occipital and parietal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and supraorbital cortex. This result is similar to those reported by  . Yet, there were no differences in the insula and anterior cingulate gyrus. The prefrontal activation pattern was different compared to phobic individuals. There was activation in the pars triangularis and opercularis, but not in the pars orbitalis. 

A possible explanation may be that non-phobic individuals were expressing emotional activity, but without the cognitive distress process (assigned to the left insular cortex) or the emotional regulation of the medial and orbital prefrontal cortex. Indeed, these participants did not show anxiety, as shown by their scores on the inventories. Other authors have found similar results, supporting the differences between anxiety (phobic individuals) and distress (non-phobic individuals).   studied individuals with spider phobia and suggested that the insula is related to a defensive response and the amygdala is related to the detection of emotionally relevant stimuli.   also found higher activation of the amygdala to faces with emotional expressions than to phobic stimuli involving small animals. 

These findings are consistent with our results, since seeing cockroaches caused emotional changes in both phobic and non-phobic individuals. Cockroaches as stimuli may be more likely to elicit disgust, aversion, and fear, because they are associated with the transmission of diseases, dirty places, sewers, etc. Yet, the phobic group also showed a defensive behavior, due to the activation of the insula. It would be interesting to test if this same pattern of activation can be found in individuals with specific phobia of small animals less associated with contamination and dirt (e.g., spiders or lizards). 

Complementary results are provided by  , who found bilateral activation of the amygdala in response to unpleasant pictures, and joint activation of the amygdala and insula in response to phobic pictures. In our study, although cockroaches are insects that are likely to lead to a response of disgust and distress in non-phobic persons, the defensive response was only shown by phobic individuals. 

In relation to the above, phobic individuals exhibited a higher activation of the right middle temporal gyrus than non-phobic individuals. However, controls showed higher activation of the left middle temporal gyrus. According to  , this is consistent with our results, because activation of the right middle temporal gyrus is more associated with a phobic response, and activation of the left middle temporal gyrus is more associated with a disgust response. 

This study has several limitations. First of all, sample size may affect the reliability of results ( ). This study only used a type of specific phobia (cockroach phobia) with few experimental stimulation conditions. We cannot establish if these results are due to a phobic condition or can also be observed in anxious non-phobic individuals. Moreover, we did not assess participants’ level of disgust as an emotional state different from fear/phobia ( ). Also, due to sample size, gender differences could not been taken into account. 

In conclusion, the data support the existence of a dual route in the processing of phobic stimuli: one route directly related to emotional processing (short/non-conscious), and another route involving several brain areas more related to a cognitive processing of feared stimuli (long/conscious).

# Abstract
 
The aim of this study was to investigate changes in regional homogeneity (ReHo) and the functional connectivity of the entorhinal cortex (EC) in vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) and to evaluate the relationships between such changes and neuropsychological measures in VaMCI individuals. In all, 31 patients with VaMCI and 32 normal controls (NCs) underwent rs-fMRI. Differences in whole-brain ReHo and seed-based bilateral EC functional connectivity (EC-FC) were determined. Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate the relationships between regions with significant group differences and different neuropsychological measures. Vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) patients had lower scores in Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and higher ones in Activity of Daily Living (ADL) (  p   < 0.05). Vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) individuals had significantly lower ReHo in the left cerebellum and right lentiform nucleus than NCs (  P   < 0.05, TFCE FWE correction). Vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) subjects showed significant decreases in the FC of the right EC in the right inferior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral pre-central gyrus, and right post-central/superior parietal lobules (  P   < 0.05, TFCE FWE correction). Significant positive correlations were found between ReHo and MoCA scores for the right lentiform nucleus (  r   = 0.37,   P   < 0.05). The right post-central/superior parietal lobules showed a significant positive correlation between right EC-FC and MoCA scores (  r   = 0.37,   P   < 0.05). Patterns in ReHo and EC-FC changes in VaMCI patients and their correlations with neuropsychological measures may be a pathophysiological foundation of cognitive impairment, which may aid the early diagnosis of VaMCI.

## Introduction 
  
Dementia is a public health issue ( ,  ). Vascular dementia is now recognized as the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, and there is increasing awareness that early intervention may help prevent dementia, even of the Alzheimer type ( ,  ,  ). Therefore, the early identification of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), particularly vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI), is particularly important. 

Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), which has been established as a useful non-invasive technique for determining how structurally segregated and functionally specialized cerebral centers are interconnected, has been receiving increased attention in brain science research in recent years and is widely used in the study of diseases of cognitive impairment ( – ). A valuable method for analyzing the local features of rs-fMRI signals ( ), regional homogeneity (ReHo) measures the temporal synchronization of time series of nearest neighbors and can be used to map local spontaneous neural activity, making it a useful tool for identifying changes in cerebral activity ( – ). Functional connectivity (FC) can be used to map long-distance connectivity and to detect the undiscovered haemodynamic responses that ReHo cannot reveal ( ). 

ReHo has also been used in several clinical studies, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), AD, and MCI ( ,  ). Zhang et al. report that the patients with MCI exhibit altered ReHo in the medial prefrontal cortex, the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and higher of ReHo in the left IPL could indicate the presence of a compensatory mechanism in MCI ( ). For FC analysis, the choice of regions of interest (ROI) is not always the same previous studies mainly focus on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) connectivity and its crucial role in cognitive function and memory. Ding et al. report that patients with subcortical VCI (sVCI) exhibit decreases in FC of the left thalamus with the PCC ( ). In addition, Deng et al. found that the patients with VaMCI exhibited altered ReHo in ACC-FC in some regions, and decreases in the left pre-central gyrus ( ). Wang et al. and Li et al. selected the thalamus and Meynert basal nuclei (BNM), respectively, as the seed voxel and demonstrated a markedly abnormal FC mode in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) ( ,  ). Less attention has been devoted to the potential role of brain regions that are significantly related to cognitive function, such as the entorhinal cortex (EC). 

EC is the gate for multimodal information from many cortices, which converges onto the hippocampus. The EC–hippocampal neural network is the key center for learning, episodic memory and performing spatial navigation ( ). Hafting et al. found grid cells with strong discharge on specific location of space in EC, and the specific anatomical basis determined the relative specificity of spatial memory ( ). Von Gunten et al. found that alteration starts from the EC and then gradually expanded to the hippocampus and surrounding structures from MCI to AD ( ,  ). According to previous studies, the EC, a vital region for widespread cognitive function, was defined as ROI in the current study. We hypothesized that the ReHo and EC functional connectivity (EC-FC) would be disrupted in VaMCI patients. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Subjects and Assessments 
  
All participants were given a detailed explanation of the study and signed an informed consent form prior to its commencement. During the selection of subjects, all of the subjects were performed T1-weighted image (T1WI), T2-weighted image (T2WI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR), and rs-fMRI scanning routinely. 

In all, 31 right-handed VaMCI patients were recruited from among outpatients and inpatients of the neurology department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi Medical University from January 2017 to December 2017. The inclusion criteria for the VaMCI group were based on the statement of the Society for Vascular Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders and the diagnostic guidelines for VaMCI in China, which include the following ( ,  ): there exist risk factors for cerebrovascular disease or cerebral vascular diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipemia, or others; imaging examination revealed evidence of cerebrovascular lesions such as white matter lesions in key infarcts and multiple lacunar infarcts. In addition, we took a coronal scanning to exclude the patients with hippocampal atrophy; patients themselves or their families complain of a decline in cognition, with such symptoms of cognitive decline lasting for at least 6 months and having a fluctuating course; damage to cognitive function and risk factors of cerebrovascular disease are directly related to cerebrovascular disease; activity of daily living (ADL) is normal or near normal with a ADL score < 26; cognitive abilities is normal, with a Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥24; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score < 26; Hachinski Ischemic Score (HIS) ≥7; Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 0.5; and cognitive impairment has not yet reached the standard of a diagnosis of dementia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). 

From the community, 32 right-handed NCs were recruited for comparison. The inclusion criteria for the NCs were as follows: no current or previous diagnosis of any neurological or psychiatric disorders; no neurological deficiencies in physical examinations; absence of abnormal findings on brain MRI; no complaints of cognitive changes; and a CDR = 0. Additional exclusion criteria for both VaMCI and NCs participants included contraindications for MRI such as use of cardiac pacemakers and claustrophobia ( ). 

A medical history was taken on all participants, who also received physical examinations and neuropsychological tests. MMSE was used to assess patient status in cognitive abilities in five aspects, including orientation, memory, attention, computation power, and language competence. The level of education for all participants was required to be junior high school and above. MoCA was used to assess cognitive abilities in the following eight aspects: visual space, executive function, naming, attention, language, abstract, delayed recall, and directional force. An MoCA score < 26 points means that the patient's cognitive function is damaged. ADL was used to assess the patients' activities of daily living. CDR was used to assess the degree of cognitive impairment of patients. HIS was used to differentiate the nature of the cognitive impairment. An HIS score ≥7 points means that the patient's cognitive impairment is caused by vascular factors. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAMD) were used to assess the patients' activity. 


### MRI Acquisition 
  
MRI data were acquired with a 3-Tesla Trio scanner (General Electric Discovery silent, MR750W, America). All participants were asked to lie still, with their eyes closed. Foam padding was employed to limit head motion, and headphones were used to reduce scanner noise. Functional images were acquired using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with a repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)/flip angle (FA) = 2,000 ms/30 ms/90, field of view (FOV) = 220 × 220 mm, slice thickness/gap = 3.6/0.4 mm and a data matrix = 64 × 64. 


### Image Data Pre-processing and Analysis 
  
Rs-fMRI data were pre-processed and analyzed using statistical parametric mapping software (SPM12,  ) and the data processing assistant for rs-fMRI (DPARSF V 4.3,  ), created using Matlab R2014a. The original data from the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format were converted into a Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIFTI) format using SPM12 software ( ). The first 10 functional images were discarded to reduce the fluctuation of MRI signals during the initial stages of scanning. To correct all layers to the same point, different time points among layers in the course of scanning needed to be corrected. It took several minutes to scan the functional images, so the subjects would inevitably move their heads, caused by breathing, blood flow, or other physiological factors. The geometric displacement caused by the head motion was corrected: data from subjects whose head translation was more than 2 mm in any direction (x, y, or z) or whose angle of head rotation was >2° were deleted in the process of scanning. To compare the images of different subjects using the same method, each participant's image was converted into a standard size and orientation. All subjects' functional images were registered onto an EPI cerebral template ( ). Then these image data were resampled based on a 3 × 3 × 3 mm  volume unit, and all functional data were standardized in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space through parameter conversion. To reduce baseline drift caused by noise, the linear trend was removed after functional images were spatially normalized. To reduce physiological interference, all functional images were processed using low-frequency filtering, from 0.01 to 0.08 Hz. A linear regression model was used to further remove the interference of other possible influencing factors, such as head and white-matter cerebrospinal fluid. The ReHo calculation was performed using pre-processed images, and the resulting images were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 4 mm full-width half-maximum ( ). FC methods based on low-frequency (0.01–0.08 Hz) spontaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations in rs-fMRI provide a powerful tool for characterizing intrinsically functional associations among brain regions. In this study, the bilateral EC ROI were generated using the free Anatomy Toolbox software V2.2b ( ). For each seed region, the BOLD time series of the voxels within the seed region was averaged to generate a reference time series. To further enhance the normality of the data analysis, the correlation r value was transformed into a   z  -value using the Fisher   r  -to-  z   transformation. 



## Statistical Analysis 
  
The statistical software package SPSS 19.0 was used to compare demographic and Neuropsychological measures. A two-sample   t  -test was adopted to compare the age, education and neuropsychological measures between the VaMCI and NC groups. The chi-square test was used to compare sex differences between groups. The difference was statistically significant when   P   < 0.05. 

A one-sample   t  -test was used to acquire the mode patterns of ReHo and EC-FC using the statistical analysis tool REST ( ,  ). A result was considered statistically significant at   P   < 0.05 (threshold free cluster enhancement family wise error, TFCE FWE corrected) and voxels >10. A two-sample   t  -test was used to compare differences in ReHo and EC-FC between VaMCI and NC. A   P   < 0.05 and cluster size threshold >10 voxels was considered statistically significant (FDR corrected). The XjView software package ( ) was used to confirm the specific anatomical positions corresponding to the MNI coordinates, which were statistically significant for the brain region. 

ROI analysis was performed on the regions showing significant ReHo or EC-FC changes in patients with VaMCI compared to NCs. Partial correlations were conducted to evaluate the relationship between abnormal functional changes demonstrated by ReHo or EC-FC values in these ROIs and neuropsychological assessments in patients with VaMCI. Statistical significance was set at   p   < 0.05.

## Discussion 
  
Previous studies have shown that normal brain development experiences local to holistic tissue patterns, which are important for revealing the neural mechanisms of cognition ( ). Moreover, certain diseases, such as schizophrenia, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, exhibit synchronicity changes in local functions that can also spread to distant brain regions ( – ). Our study shows that compared to NCs, patients with VaMCI had significantly lower ReHo in the left cerebellum and right lentiform nucleus and significant decreases in the FC of the right EC in the right inferior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral pre-central gyrus, and right post-central/superior parietal lobule. The right lentiform nucleus showed a significant positive correlation between ReHo and MoCA scores and a significant positive correlation between the FC of the right EC and MoCA scores. 

The cerebellum plays an important role in maintaining the balance of the body and coordinating its movements. An increasing number of studies have shown that the cerebellum also functions in cognitive regulation ( ,  ). In their SPECT studies, Baillieux et al. found that the main cognitive function of the left cerebellum is attention and the function of visual space, confirming the cross-connection pattern of a loop passing from the cerebellum to the brain to the cerebellum again ( ). Zheng et al. using BOLD-fMRI, found that both the cerebellum and cerebral cortex participated in the cognitive process of spatial memory ( ). Similar to that study, we found that patients with VaMCI had significantly lower ReHo in the left cerebellum. Moreover, we also found that patients with VaMCI had significantly lower ReHo in the right lentiform nucleus. The lentiform nucleus which received the cholinergic projection of the Meynert basal forebrain and had extensive fibrous connections with the rest of the brain, playing a variety of functions such as motor coordination and cognitive activity. A wide range of diseases are related to the injury of the lenticular nucleus (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and so forth) ( ,  ). As part of the basal ganglia, the lentiform nucleus is not only the core structure of the related motor system but also plays an important role in cognitive activities, such as working memory, executive function, learning, emotive behaviors, and reward. Cao et al. found a significant reduction in rCBF in the lentiform nucleus ( ). In our study, the changes we observed in the ReHo of VaMCI patients imply that the left cerebellum and right lentiform nucleus were impaired; this is a pathophysiological foundation for the cognitive impairment evident in early stages of the disease. 

Our study adds new evidence to the disconnection hypothesis because we investigated EC connectivity with all other brain regions. We found that several regions such as the right post-central/superior parietal lobule have disrupted connectivity to the right EC. In addition, Colby et al. using EEG, proved that the parietal lobe plays an important role in spatial memory ( ). We found that VaMCI patients had significant decreases in the FC of the right EC in the right post-central/superior parietal lobule. This is related to the impairment of multiple cognitive domains such as orientation. In the frontal lobe region, we found that the lateral frontal regions (right inferior/middle frontal gyrus) showed disrupted connectivity to the right EC, which is related to attention processing ( ). In addition, we also noticed that the bilateral pre-central gyrus showed decreased connectivity to the right EC. This may imply that the change in connectivity extended into the primary motor cortex in VaMCI patients. The relationship between EC and the above regions in VaMCI patients must be further investigated. 

Based on correlation analyses, the decreased right lentiform nucleus showed a significant positive correlation between the ReHo and MoCA scores; there was a significant positive correlation between the decreased FC of the right EC connectivity with the right post-central/superior parietal lobule and MoCA scores. That is, the lower the FC, the lower the MoCA score. As noted above, the lenticular nucleus and the right post-central/superior parietal lobule play an important role in a variety of cognitive functions; these brain areas are also known to be the site of the pathophysiological foundations of cognitive impairment caused by the early stages of the disease. 

As far as we know, our study is the first in which both ReHo and EC-FC analysis have been applied to rs-fMRI in VaMCI. We hypothesize that the ReHo and EC-FC would be disrupted in VaMCI patients. In theory, increased functional activity could provide a compensatory mechanism, through plasticity, helps limit the consequences of cognitive impairment. However, this putative compensatory function is at odds with what we have found in this study. These include the fact that no areas showed increased ReHo and EC-FC were detected in VaMCI patients than in the NCs. Hence, we consider that might be contribute to the light degree of cognitive impairment in the patients screened and the relatively small sample size, which requires more investigation ( ). 

There were some limitations to the current study. First, our sample size was small. Second, we could not exclude the interference of potential confounding factors such as artifacts of the respiratory and cardiac cycles, and so on. Third, we did not add the MCI case groups which the early stage of AD for further analysis. Fourth, we used neuropsychological measures that reflected overall cognitive function in correlation analyses; more detailed measures, particularly for specific cognitive domains, must be further investigated. The last, we were unable to observe dynamic changes in ReHo and EC-FC following the onset of VaMCI. A longitudinal study is needed. 


## Conclusion 
  
The patterns of changes in ReHo and EC-FC in VaMCI patients and the correlation with neuropsychological measures may be a pathophysiological foundation of cognitive impairment, which will aid the early diagnosis of VaMCI.

# Abstract
 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by dysfunction in distributed functional brain networks. Previous studies have reported abnormal changes in static functional connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, the dynamic characteristics of brain networks in PD is still poorly understood. This study aimed to quantify the characteristics of dynamic functional connectivity in PD patients at nodal, intra- and inter-subnetwork levels. Resting-state fMRI data of a total of 42 PD patients and 40 normal controls (NCs) were investigated from the perspective of the temporal variability on the connectivity profiles across sliding windows. The results revealed that PD patients had greater nodal variability in precentral and postcentral area (in sensorimotor network, SMN), middle occipital gyrus (in visual network), putamen (in subcortical network) and cerebellum, compared with NCs. Furthermore, at the subnetwork level, PD patients had greater intra-network variability for the subcortical network, salience network and visual network, and distributed changes of inter-network variability across several subnetwork pairs. Specifically, the temporal variability within and between subcortical network and other cortical subnetworks involving SMN, visual, ventral and dorsal attention networks as well as cerebellum was positively associated with the severity of clinical symptoms in PD patients. Additionally, the increased inter-network variability of cerebellum-auditory pair was also correlated with clinical severity of symptoms in PD patients. These observations indicate that temporal variability can detect the distributed abnormalities of dynamic functional network of PD patients at nodal, intra- and inter-subnetwork scales, and may provide new insights into understanding PD. 
 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people around the world. The prominent symptoms in PD are the motor deficits including tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which are mainly due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra ( ;  ). Previous studies had proposed that the dysfunction of corticostriatal network pathways and neural circuits is related to the impairments in PD ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Despite being extensively investigated, mechanisms underlying disturbances in PD are still poorly understood. 

The past decade has seen remarkable growth of network neuroscience and neuroimaging techniques and their applications to abnormal brain connectivity in psychiatric and neurological disorders. Several previous studies highlighted that PD could be considered as a disease related to the disruptions in several networks using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) ( ;  ), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) ( ), task fMRI ( ) and other imaging techniques ( ). Functional network analysis based on resting-state fMRI data, accounting for the intrinsic blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations, offers an effective tool for characterizing interactions between brain regions and quantifying abnormal organization of brain network in disorders ( ;  ,  ). Previous studies on large-scale network of PD patients by graph theoretic analysis revealed disruptions in the topological properties of brain networks and these network measures have been demonstrated to serve as potential biomarkers of PD for clinical diagnosis ( ). Furthermore, altered modular organization of functional brain networks in PD patients has also been reported ( ;  ), implying an abnormal functional integration of PD. 

However, the majority of earlier studies have adopted a “static” point of view, whereas functional connectivity (FC) between regions are actually associated with dynamic brain activity over time ( ;  ). Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis has been directed to assess relevant FC fluctuations and examine how functional organization evolves over time. It sheds new insights on the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of resting brain activity and captures FC alterations induced by disease pathologies ( ;  ). For example, previous studies have found that Schizophrenia (SZ) patients displayed within-network disruptions of the DMN ( ) as well as weaker across-network connectivity between DMN and other resting-state networks (RSNs) ( ;  ). In addition, the dynamic connectivity patterns have served as features to gain better identification output in the classification of MCI subjects ( ) and of autism patients ( ) than the standard static approaches. These results suggest that the abnormal network characteristics of PD may emerge from dynamic functional connections that cannot be completely captured by static approaches and may help deepen our understanding of this disease. 

Despite these applications, alterations in the dynamic properties of PD individuals still remain largely unknown.   first investigated the temporal states of dFC and variability of network topology in PD patients using k-means clustering, and found that PD patients showed a decrease in the sparsely connected State I, paralleled by an increase in the stronger interconnected State II, suggesting the altered functional segregation and abnormal global integration in brain networks.   employed Product Hidden Markov Models (PHMM) to assess the connectivity state changes between a set of RSNs in dementia with Lewy bodies, a disease sharing similar features to PD, and figured out networks (i.e., occipito-parieto-frontal network, the medial occipital network and the right fronto-parietal network) related to impairment of cognitive function in patients. However, these studies mainly focused on the connectivity state changes of the whole brain, ignoring the dynamic connectivity profile of particular brain regions. A recent work ( ) investigated the temporal properties of dFC by defining the temporal variability of FCs associated with a specific brain region, and the temporal variability reveled a strong correlation with BOLD/EEG activity. This approach allows localization of regions showing significant variability between groups, thus helping to reveal the abnormality of regional dynamics of functional brain networks in various brain diseases. Another work ( ) integrated both temporal and spatial variabilities of dynamic functional networks for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease and boosted the diagnosis performance, demonstrating that the spatio-temporal interaction patterns can provide important information on the underlying nature of neurodegenerative disease. Actually, PD is a disease associated with a disruption across diffuse areas of brain and interactions of multiscale organization. However, the temporal properties of subnetworks (e.g., the intra- and inter-network variability) have not been investigated yet. Temporal variability may help elucidate the aberrant changes underlying PD patients from the perspective of regional dynamics of functional brain networks. A systematic examination of dFC patterns and temporal variability in aspects of nodal, intra- and inter- subnetworks may further deepen our understanding of PD. 

In this study, we performed dFC analysis built on non-overlapping networks to investigate the aberrant dFC patterns in PD patients. With a focus on temporal variability of FC profiles, we systematically examined the dFC changes at nodal, intra- and inter- subnetwork levels. Our major goal was to demonstrate whether: (1) the temporal variability could characterize the underlying alterations in the PD cohort and/or (2) the changes in temporal variability could account for some clinical symptoms of PD. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants and Assessment 
  
Forty-four PD subjects were recruited from Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The inclusion criteria included: (i) a diagnosis of PD without any record of other neurological or psychiatric disorders; (ii) age ≥ 45 years; (iii) Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE ( )] ≥ 24; (iii) no depressive symptoms [evaluated by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) ( )]. Clinical evaluation was assessed with Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) score ( ) for the disease stage and the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-Part III (UPDRS-III) ( ) for severity of motor symptoms. Forty-three normal controls (NCs) were also included for the study. Three normal participants with head motion >2 mm of translation or >2 degree of rotation and two PD patients with poor co-registration in cerebellum were excluded in the following analysis (see section “Data Preprocessing” for details), leaving 42 patients and 40 normal controls for analysis. The relevant demographic and clinical information are summarized in  . This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the “ethics committee of Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China” with written informed consent from all subjects.

### MRI Acquisition 
  
Data acquisition was carried out on a GE 3.0 T HDxt MRI scanner with an 8-channel phased-array head coil. High-resolution T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired using a fast, spoiled gradient echo sequence (FSPGR) with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 5.528 ms, echo time (TE) = 1.74 ms, matrix size = 256 × 256, flip angle = 12°, slice thickness = 1 mm, 196 sagittal slices. A total of 210 volumes of resting-state fMRI data were acquired using an EPI sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, matrix size = 64 × 64, flip angle = 90°, voxel size = 3.75 × 3.75 × 4 mm . Subjects were required to remain still and awake with eyes closed during the scan. 


### Data Preprocessing 
  
Preprocessing of fMRI data was performed using the DPARSF toolbox ( ). The first 10 volumes of each functional time series were discarded considering instability of the initial MRI signal and adaptation of participants to the circumstance, leaving 200 volumes in total for processing as follows: slice-timing, realignment to the mean image, co-registration to the T1 image, motion correction, normalized to a standard template (Montreal Neurological Institute), reslicing to 3 × 3 × 3 mm , spatial smoothing (FWMH = 6 mm) and band pass filtered (0.01–0.1 Hz). Finally, the nuisance covariates, including 24 head motion parameters, white matter signal, and CSF signal were regressed out. The resulting time courses were used for the following brain network construction and analysis. In order to limit the impact of head motion, we excluded the subjects with head motion greater than 2 mm of translation motion or more than 2 degrees of rotation. 


### Definition of Functional Brain Networks 
  
We adopted the spherical 264 functional Region of Interests (ROIs) defined by   across cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar structures, and extracted a representative BOLD time series by averaging signal in all voxels within each ROI. These brain regions were defined by resting-state FC mapping and multiple task fMRI meta-analysis, ensuring the functional significance of network nodes. In brain network analysis, each ROI was defined as a node, and the functional connectivity between ROIs was estimated from the corresponding representative BOLD time series. Consistent with previous study ( ), the whole brain were mapped into 13 putative functional modules, including sensorimotor (SMN), default mode (DMN), cingulo-opercular (CON), fronto-parietal (FPN), subcortical, salience (SAN), auditory, visual, ventral attention (VAN), dorsal attention (DAN), memory retrieval, cerebellum, and uncertain networks ( ). This parcellation offers a comprehensive view for the study of functional brain modules, allowing to identify connectivity patterns and interactions between different modules. In this study, we would mainly report and discuss the results related to the 12 main networks but paying no attention to the “Uncertain” network, as it does not constitute specific cortical networks with explicable function. 
  
Schematic overview of the temporal variability calculation.   (A)   Network partition of 264 putative functional regions defined by   L, Left; R, right.   (B)   Each regional BOLD signal was segmented into non-overlapping windows, and the whole brain functional connectivity network was constructed using Pearson correlation of the representation BOLD time series in each window.   (C)   From the raw functional connectivity matrix in one time window, nodal connectivity profile is the vector that describes its connectivity with all the other nodes (e.g., the column marked by black line); intra-subnetwork connectivity profile is the upper triangle (due to symmetry) of the connectivity matrix within one subnetwork (e.g., SMN); inter-network connectivity profile is the connectivity matrix between two subnetworks (e.g., SMN-visual, as the block marked by a small black rectangular window).   (D)   Calculation of temporal variability. The nodal, intra- and inter-network connectivity profile in each window was unfolded into connectivity vectors, respectively, and the temporal variability was calculated as the average correlation coefficients of the connectivity vectors across different windows with a deduction from 1. 
  
For better interpretation for the anatomical location of specific regions, the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas ( ) was also used in this study. 


### Temporal Variability 
  
For each participant, dFC were computed based on sliding temporal window approach. Following the strategy in Zhang’s work ( ), we used segments of BOLD time series without overlapping to calculate temporal variability (nodal, intra- and inter-network variability). Briefly, the entire BOLD time series for each subject was divided into non-overlapping windows. Then within each window, connectivity between each pair of nodes was estimated by the Pearson’s correlation coefficients of the BOLD time series ( ). 

#### Nodal Variability 
  
To characterize the dynamic configuration of a specific region across all time windows, we calculated the temporal variability of each node ( ;  ). For a given region   k  , the connectivity profile at time window   i   can be denoted as   F  , which is a vector with   M   values that describes the connection map based on the connectivity between region   k   with all other regions. Then the connectivity vectors in different windows were subsequently used to estimate the variability   V   of brain region   k  , which is defined as one minus the average correlation of that region’s connectivity profile across all time windows ( ;  ), that is, 

where   N   denotes the number of windows ( ). The second part of   V   is the averaged correlation values between any two connectivity profiles derived from different time windows, indicating the similarity between connectivity profiles. A small value of variability   V   indicates a high correlation of a node’s functional architecture across different time windows. 

As for the parameters selection, previous studies suggested that window size around 30–60 s should be suitable to capture the resting-state dFC fluctuations and produce robust results ( ;  ;  ). And another study ( ) showed that changes of brain connectivity are not sensitive to the specific time-window length (in the range of 10–20 TRs, 20–40 s). We performed the variability analysis at different window length (  l   = 10, 11, 12, …, 20 volumes, corresponding to 20, 22, 24, …, 40 s, respectively), and found that variability obtained from different window lengths produced highly correlated results (  r   > 0.98,  ), indicating that this metric is not sensitive to the choice of window length. Therefore, in the following sections, we reported the results obtained with the window size of 20TRs (40 s). 


#### Intra- and Inter-Network Variability 
  
The connectivity patterns within and between subnetworks also fluctuate dynamically over a short period of time ( ;  ;  ). In order to assess the dynamic interactions within and between subnetworks and identify the system-level dynamic brain organization, we defined the intra- and inter- network variability in a way similar to the definition of nodal variability. For a subnetwork, all the intra-network connectivity in each window were unfolded into a long connectivity vector, and then the intra-network variability was estimated as the average correlation coefficients of the connectivity vectors across different windows with a deduction from 1 ( ). Intra-network variability characterizes the changes of connectivity within subnetwork over time. High value of intra-network variability means the functional architecture within the network is poorly correlated across different time windows, implying an unstable state. Similarly, for two subnetworks, all the connectivity between the two subnetworks were unfolded into a long connectivity vector, and then the inter-network variability was estimated as the average correlation coefficients of the connectivity vectors across windows with a deduction from 1 ( ). High value of inter-network variability means that the interactions between the two networks reconfigure frequently but not maintain a stable pattern. 



### Statistical Analysis 
  
Non-parametric permutation tests ( ;  ) were applied to test the between-group differences in nodal, intra- and inter-network variability. In each permutation, each subject was randomly reassigned to one of a pair of groups with the same number of subjects as in the original patient and control groups. Then the nodal, intra- and inter-network variability were computed for each randomized group and the between-group difference for all the metrics was calculated, respectively. This randomization procedure was repeated 10000 times, resulting in a sampled null between-group difference permutation distributions for each metric. Finally, the   p  -value was then calculated as the proportion of total entries resulting from the permutation distribution that were greater than (or smaller than) the observed group effect. 

Statistical analysis for head motion parameters and demographic measures were performed using two sample   t  -test. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between altered temporal variability and clinical variables of disease severity (UPDRS-III score and Hoehn and Yahr staging) at a threshold for statistical significance of   p   < 0.05. Statistical analysis of all the metrics were implemented using Matlab (version 2014a; MathWorks). Visualization of results were performed using Python. 


### Validation Analysis 
  
To evaluate the robustness of our main results, we conducted some validation analysis. (i) Parcellation scheme: given that the variability may be affected by the topological spatial constraints and definition of ROIs, we also constructed functional brain networks using an additional functional whole-brain parcellation scheme consisting of 268 ROIs ( ) (referred to as Shen268 atlas), in which all the ROIs are assigned to eight different functional networks. (ii) Window length: to investigate the potential effects of window length, we performed the correlation analysis of temporal variability obtained at different window lengths, and also repeated the analysis with the average value of variability across different window lengths, following the strategy used in  . 



## Results 
  
### Nodal Variability 
  
We found significant nodal variability changes in PD patients across several regions. The nodal variability of precentral and postcentral gyrus (in SMN), middle occipital gyrus (in visual network), putamen (in subcortical network) and cerebellum in patients showed significantly increased variability (  p   < 0.005, 10000 permutations, uncorrected) compared to NCs ( ). While in this PD cohort, no nodes showed significantly decreased variability.

### Intra-Network Variability 
  
Among the 13 subnetworks, we found that subnetworks including subcortical network, SAN and visual network tended to display greater intra-network variability in PD than NCs (  p   < 0.05, 10000 permutations,  ). Only the variability of intra-subcortical network showed a positive correlation with UPDRS-III by spearman correlation analysis ( ).

#### Correlation Between Inter-Network Variability and UPDRS-III 
  
We further identified the subnetwork pairs which showed significant correlation (  p   < 0.05, Spearman correlation) to the clinical status. To ensure correlations are not driven by a few extreme values, we removed outliers in the data prior to performing linear regression. We defined an outlier as a value outside of 3 standard deviation from the group mean. Performing regression with and without outliers actually did not qualitatively change the results. 

Significant correlation between inter-network variability and UPDRS-III mainly appeared in subnetwork pairs associated with subcortical network and cerebellum ( ). Compared with NCs, PD group had greater inter-network variabilities for the subnetwork pairs of subcortical network with respect to sensorimotor, visual, ventral attention, dorsal attention, and cerebellum networks, and their variability also had significant positive correlation with UPDRS-III in PD patients ( – ). In addition, the inter-network variability for subnetwork pairs of cerebellum and auditory network also showed group difference as well as significant positive correlation with UPDRS-III ( ). We have also evaluated the correlation between temporal variability and H-Y scores, while the results showed that the nodal/intra- and inter-network variability had a weak correlation (all   r   < 0.23, all   p   > 0.14) with H-Y scores.

### Validation Results 
  
We validated our main findings using different analysis strategies, involving sliding window lengths (  and  ), parcellation schemes (  and  ). We found that the temporal variability including nodal, intra- and inter- network variability estimated from windows of different lengths were highly correlated, indicating that these metrics is not sensitive to the choice of window length. For further validation of the results, we also used the average variability across different window lengths for the same analysis procedures, the main results are highly similar with those at window length of 20TRs. For the results obtained at Shen268 atlas, we observed similar pattern of variability difference of two groups, which were mainly located at Subcortical-cerebellum, Motor, and Visual (Visual I, Visual II, Visual association) networks. Besides, the significant correlation between temporal variability and UPDRS-III also mainly appeared in subnetwork pairs associated with Subcortical-cerebellum network. These results replicated the main findings obtained with Power-264 atlas. 



## Discussion 
  
In the present study, we investigated the variability of the dynamic functional brain network of PD patients at nodal, intra- and inter-network levels. Our results demonstrated that PD patients exhibited increased nodal variability involving precentral and postcentral areas, occipital area, putamen, and cerebellum. Moreover, PD patients demonstrated significantly increased intra-network variability within subcortical, salience and visual networks, as well as distributed increase in inter-network variability of several subnetwork pairs. Furthermore, the intra-network variability of subcortical network and the inter-network variability of subcortical network with respect to SMN, visual network, VAN, DAN and cerebellum showed significant correlation with the clinical score UPDRS-III, suggesting the special role of subcortical network in functional abnormality of PD. Besides, the inter-network variability of the cerebellum-auditory pair also had significant correlation with the clinical score UPDRS-III. These results suggest that PD patients showed widespread functional network abnormalities in term of temporal variability, and the abnormal temporal variability also correlated with clinical manifestations and thus offering new insights in understanding PD. 

### Distributed Variability Changes in PD Patients 
  
At the nodal and intra-network level, we found a widespread pattern of increased variability in PD patients, encompassing sensorimotor (SMN), visual, subcortical networks and cerebellum. A similar pattern was also observed in ROIs defined by the Shen268 atlas, that is, the variability difference was mainly located in Subcortical-cerebellum, Motor, and Visual (Visual I, Visual II, Visual association) subnetworks (  and  ). Previous study has reported that the primary sensorimotor area in normal subjects changed little over time ( ;  ). Conversely, in this study, the precentral and postcentral areas (in sensorimotor network) revealed higher variability in patients, unveiling that nodes in SMN of PD patients demonstrated a non-stationary functional configuration with other regions. In fact, several studies have identified abnormal functional connectivity in SMN which is indicative of impaired sensorimotor integration occurred in PD ( ;  ). Besides, the increased variability has also been observed in visual network both at nodal and intra-network levels. Indeed, visual network is another major complex sensory domain affected by PD, and PD may lead to visual hallucinations, perceptual, executive and sleep dysfunction ( ;  ;  ). These results together suggest that the altered dFC patterns observed in our study may be related to the deficits in these sensory regions. Moreover, the salience network, mainly comprised of the anterior insula, is a central hub involved in integrating the somatosensory and cognitive-affective information to guide behavior ( ). The increased intra-salience network variability found in our data corroborated previous findings of reduced hub role ( ) and abnormal activation patterns in insula in PD patients ( ,  ). In addition, there were other between-group differences in regional or inter-subnetwork variability associated with subcortical network and cerebellum, many of which have been suggested to be related to structural or functional impairment in PD patients ( ). Taken together, the abnormality of regional variability identified in our study indicates altered dFC across distributed nodes and subnetworks, reflecting those regions are at an unstable state. 

For the inter-network variability, we found that the inter-motor variability was higher than intra-motor variability, which is consistent with previous studies ( ) that lower variability within subnetwork may maintain a more stable configuration. In addition, significant higher inter-network variability was found across distributed subsystem pairs. The varying interactions between subsystems may be tied to functional coordination between subnetworks ( ), the increased inter-network variability in PD patients implies an unstable state and more dynamic interactions. Our observations was consistent with  , which reported an increase in the number of transitions between states and higher variability in global efficiency of brain network of PD patients, implying a less efficient and more unstable information transfer within/between functional subnetworks. Furthermore, substantial efforts have been made in previous studies to elucidate the neural basis of PD, with mounting evidence indicating deficits of distributed brain networks and wide-spread white matter damage in PD ( ;  ;  ). Our results putatively reflect the abnormal global integration of the brain networks in PD from the dynamic perspective. 


### Variability Associated With Subcortical Network 
  
Despite the distributed alteration of temporal variability in PD patients, the variability showing significant correlation with clinical score was particularly associated subcortical network ( ), suggesting its clinical significance in PD. Results obtained with the Shen268 atlas showed a similar trend, which were mainly associated with the Subcortical-cerebellum subnetwork ( ). At nodal and intra-network levels, a higher nodal variability in putamen and intra-network variability within subcortical network was observed, which is compatible with previous study highlighting the severely affected striatal dopamine depletion in putamen and reduced connectivity between striatal and thalamus within subcortical network ( ). At the inter-network level, the increased inter-network variability between subcortical network and cortical networks (sensorimotor, visual, and attention network) in PD patients also correlated with worsening motor symptoms in PD. All these cortical networks are known to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PD ( ), and the dysfunction of cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical circuit associated with motor deficits is well documented in PD patients ( ). More specifically, altered functional connection and integration of subcortical to sensorimotor and visual networks have been reported in PD ( ;  ;  ). Connectivity changes and dysfunctional integration in attention work (including dorsal attention network (DAN) and ventral attention network (VAN)) have also been reported in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment and visual hallucinations, respectively ( ;  ). Here the higher level variability of FC profile in subcortical-cortical coupling may therefore provide further information for the prediction of disease severity. Furthermore, a significantly increased variability of cerebellum-subcortical coupling in PD patients was positive associated with UPDRS-III in our study. According to  , the reciprocal connections between basal ganglia and the cerebellum provide the anatomical substrate for the cerebellar contributions to a wide range of behaviors. The increased variability pattern between cerebellum and subcortical network, could also support the markedly lower striatal connectivity with cerebellum in PD group reported in  , thus reinforcing the relevance to parkinsonism of the described circuits connecting the cerebellum to the basal ganglia ( ;  ). 


### Variability Associated With Cerebellum 
  
Interestingly, in the present study, the node in the cerebellum showed significantly increased nodal variability in PD patients. Studies have shown that the cerebellum is involved in motor coordination ( ) as well as integration of motor and cognitive networks. Pathological changes in the cerebellum have been reported in a previous study ( ). Considering this, our results revealed an abnormal dynamic connectivity profile between nodes in the cerebellum with other regions, which may be related to the dysfunction of cerebellum in PD patients. 

We also found that a significantly increased inter-network variability between cerebellum and cortical network (auditory network) showed positive correlation with UPDRS-III. This emphasizes that the unstable dynamic interaction between the cerebellum and auditory network may also relate to the motor symptom of PD. Similar to basal ganglia in subcortical network, cerebellum has also shown anatomical loops between cerebellum and nearly all cortical subnetworks, suggesting its high global brain connectivity ( ;  ;  ). Combined with the observations that the inter-network variability between subcortical network and other cortical subnetworks as well as cerebellum were also correlated with clinical score (UPDRS-III) noted above, our results uncover the fact that cerebellum also serve as an important role in PD pathology. 

In fact, the subcortical network in this study (mainly comprised of basal ganglia and thalamus) and the cerebellum are densely interconnected at the subcortical level and formed an integrated network ( ). These subcortical systems support the convergence of diverse cortical and subcortical afferents, as well as neuromodulatory signals from the brainstem, thus serving as a hub for large-scale network integration in the human brain ( ). Previous studies revealed that pathological lesions of most disorders were concentrated in hub regions, especially in the striatum and thalamus, implying that subcortical hubs represent key pathological foci across multiple brain disorders ( ). Evidence from previous studies has shown that cortico-subcortical circuits are linked to a diverse range of limbic, cognitive and motor control functions ( ;  ). PD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe and early subcortical pathology as well as clinical impairments extend across cognitive and motor domains. Our results provide further evidence of a subcortical hub by capturing the dynamic variability changes in the subcortical network of PD, suggesting that the subcortical dysfunction may contribute to pathological changes in PD. 


### Limitations 
  
Several limitations of this study should be recognized. First, motor manifestations of PD subjects are evaluated only using the motor portion of UPDRS without other neuropsychological tests for the diagnosis of PD. There are other substantial non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction and sleep disorders experienced by PD patients ( ). Future work could investigate variability metrics and their association with other neuropsychological scores and cognitive performance to establish the relationship between dynamic analysis and clinical diagnosis. Second, PD is a heterogeneous disorder with different symptoms and functional connectivity patterns ( ). Due to the diversity of possible status of drug use, personality, or genetic factors in our data and a large number of comparisons, some results didn’t pass a false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple comparisons correction. Accordingly, we reported the results by setting a relative low significance level (  p   < 0.005) in nodal variability and different statistic levels (  p   < 0.05 and   p   < 0.005) in intra- and inter-network variability. Actually, a more heterogeneous status in the patients’ group will most likely lead to higher statistical variance, rendering it more difficult to detect significant functional connectivity differences between patients and controls. Therefore, a larger sample size and more strict inclusion criteria will be needed in further study to reveal temporal variability differences. 



## Conclusion 
  
This study reported alterations of temporal variability in PD patients at nodal, intra- and inter-network levels. Our analysis showed that PD patients have higher nodal variability in precentral and postcentral area, middle occipital gyrus, putamen, cerebellum as well as the increased intra- and inter-motor variability across several distributed subnetworks compared with normal controls. Moreover, the higher intra- and inter-network variability associated with the subcortical network and cerebellum showed significant correlation with UPDRS-III motor score, suggesting its clinical significance. Our results suggest that temporal variability of functional connectivity profile can detect the aberrant dynamic connectivity patterns, which were associated with the clinical deficits in PD and thus may deepen our understanding of the disease.

# Title

The ventromedial prefrontal cortex is particularly responsive to social evaluations requiring the use of person-knowledge

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
Humans can rely on diverse sources of information to evaluate others, including knowledge (e.g., occupation, likes and dislikes, education, etc.) and perceptual cues (e.g., attractiveness, race, etc.). Previous research has identified brain regions supporting person evaluations, but are evaluations based on perceptual cues versus person-knowledge processed differently? Moreover, are neural responses consistent when person-knowledge is available but unnecessary for the evaluation? This fMRI study examined how the use and availability of person-knowledge shapes the neural underpinnings of social evaluations. Participants evaluated well-known actors based on attractiveness or body of work (i.e., person-knowledge) and unknown models based on attractiveness only. Analyses focused on the VMPFC, following research implicating this region in positive evaluations based on person-knowledge. The VMPFC was sensitive to the (1) availability of person-knowledge, showing greater responses as ratings became more positive for actors (but not models) regardless of rating dimension and (2) use of available person-knowledge, showing greater activity as ratings for likability based on body of work became more positive for actors versus models rated on attractiveness. These findings indicate that although brain regions supporting person evaluation are sensitive to the availability to person-knowledge, they are even more responsive when judgments require the use of available person-knowledge. 
 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
We can efficiently form impressions of others based on a multitude of perceptual characteristics. For example, our evaluations can be based on perceptual cues conveying social traits  or group membership . Although evaluations based on perceptual cues are efficient  and ubiquitous , the availability of person-knowledge (i.e., target-specific biographical information) allows more individualized evaluations . Conceptually, these two sources of knowledge are thought to be processed simultaneously and interactively . 

Although the majority of social neuroscience research focuses on how perceptual cues alone affect evaluations , a few studies have compared social judgments based on the simultaneous presentation or use of both perceptual cues and person-knowledge . These studies have primarily examined perceived consistency of appearance-behavior pairings  or the impact of perceptual and knowledge-based familiarity on face perception . One transcranial magnetic stimulation study reported a causal role for the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in processing new information about faces previously paired with positive and negative person-knowledge . In that study, participants formed impressions of congruent face-behavior pairs (e.g., a trustworthy face paired with sentences conveying positive behaviors) and then indicated whether their impressions were consistent with subsequently presented trait words. Researchers found that the DMPFC played a causal role in updating impressions based on new person-knowledge . Other research suggests that such sensitivity to valenced person-knowledge in the DMPFC is relatively spontaneous . 

Importantly, theoretical and empirical work suggests that more ventral aspects of the medial prefrontal cortex (e.g., VMPFC) may more directly index increasingly positive explicit evaluations of others  compared to the DMPFC. In the present study, we therefore examined activity in the VMPFC and other exploratory regions (e.g., DMPFC) as participants explicitly evaluated people based on (1) perceptual cues or person-knowledge when such knowledge was available (e.g., for known actors) or (2) perceptual cues only when person-knowledge was unavailable (e.g., for unknown models). A direct examination of percept- and knowledge-based forms of explicit evaluations, both independent of one another and in combination, is necessary to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the neural processes supporting person evaluations. Although both kinds of evaluations may indeed recruit a similar set of brain regions, novel insights into person evaluation can be gained by identifying (1) the relative impact of percept- versus knowledge-based information on regions supporting explicit person evaluations, (2) the convergences and divergences in regions across this network (e.g., VMPFC vs. DMPFC), and (3) the combined impact when both percept- and knowledge-based information are present. 


## Perceptual Cues 
  
Perceptual cues provide valuable information that can be gleaned just from looking at another person. For example, we can often gather information about someone’s socioeconomic status via clothing, dominance via physical size, or trustworthiness via facial expression . Many neuroimaging studies on person evaluation have focused on novel faces lacking prior knowledge associations . Irrespective of accuracy, perceptual cues frequently guide evaluations as they are often the only or most salient source of social information . 

Past research has implicated different neural regions in various percept-based evaluations. For example, the amygdala is frequently implicated in studies involving race , valence of emotional expressions , or trustworthiness based on facial cues . Some regions have been shown to respond to variations in attractiveness. For example, the ventral striatum has been shown to be involved in reward processing and positive attractiveness ratings . To a lesser extent than the amygdala and ventral striatum, the VMPFC has also been shown to be sensitive to positive evaluations of others (e.g., positive ratings of facial attractiveness) . 


## Person-knowledge 
  
Although evaluations based solely on perceptual cues (e.g., attractiveness) are efficient, we also evaluate others based on person-knowledge , often leading to more complex individuated impressions . In the present study, we examined brain regions associated with the availability and use of person-knowledge during explicit evaluations. Specifically, we were interested in whether these processes are supported more by the DMPFC or VMPFC. The DMPFC has been implicated in various aspects of thinking about people including the retrieval of person-knowledge , the formation and updating of impressions , and mentalizing . The VMPFC is also believed to support relatively explicit social evaluations based on person-knowledge, with typically greater activity for positively evaluated people . Consistent with its sensitivity to both social and evaluative information , meta-analyses and reviews of the literature purport that the VMPFC more broadly supports the flexible generation of affective meaning by integrating evaluation-relevant information from multiple dimensions and time points . In other words, the VMPFC is suggested to support the process of combining current environmental cues and past knowledge, possibly to predict future outcomes. In the context of person evaluation, the VMPFC is sensitive to explicit positive evaluations based on previous knowledge . For example, greater VMPFC activity is observed when person-knowledge about someone’s high compared to low moral status is available . Moreover, the VMPFC is sensitive to personally relevant and well-liked individuals about whom perceivers have extensive knowledge . Based on previous research implicating the VMPFC in explicit evaluations solely from perceptual cues  or solely from person-knowledge , we focused on this region as our primary region of interest (ROI). We anticipated that the VMPFC may be particularly involved in person evaluations based on the simultaneous presentation of both types of information. 


## Study overview 
  
In the current event-related fMRI investigation, we examined how the availability and use of person-knowledge shapes neural responses during percept- and knowledge-based evaluations. Specifically, participants evaluated: (1) unknown models on attractiveness (i.e., absence of person-knowledge), (2) well-known actors on attractiveness (i.e., availability of person-knowledge that is irrelevant to evaluations), and (3) well-known actors on likability based on body of work (i.e., availability of person-knowledge is required for evaluations). We focus on attractiveness and body of work because these two dimensions best allow us to differentiate the influence of perceptual cues and person-knowledge. Attractiveness judgments can be made based solely on perceptual cues and in the absence of person-knowledge (e.g., unfamiliar models). However, even if person-knowledge is available, one can presumably assess attractiveness based on perceptual cues without being influenced by person-knowledge (e.g., familiar actors). On the other hand, body-of-work judgments rely on person-knowledge and should not depend on attractiveness. We first examined the relative impact of the absence, mere availability, and use of person-knowledge during deliberative evaluations by identifying potential increases in VMPFC activity in response to increasingly positive physical-based evaluations of models (i.e., attractiveness), increasingly positive physical-based evaluations of actors (i.e., attractiveness), and increasingly positive knowledge-based evaluations of actors (i.e., likability based on body of work), respectively. We additionally compared each of the three conditions to each other to determine whether the relationship between positive ratings and VMPFC activity was especially pronounced for a given form of person evaluation. 

### Predictions 
  
Based on previous research , we anticipated that the VMPFC would generally respond to targets associated with relatively positive (vs. negative) evaluations regardless of rating dimension (i.e., body of work vs. attractiveness). Additionally, the VMPFC may be sensitive to positive evaluations when person-knowledge is available (vs. not available). Specifically, we predicted preferential activity following positive evaluations when person-knowledge is either available (viz., evaluating the physical attractiveness or body of work for well-known actors) or required during person evaluation (viz., evaluating actor likeability vis-a-vis their body of work). In other words, we expected the VMPFC to be more involved when evaluating actors more positively regardless of rating dimension compared to when evaluating models more positively based on attractiveness. Lastly, the VMPFC may be particularly sensitive to positive evaluations when person-knowledge is required. Specifically, we predicted preferential recruitment of the VMPFC when evaluating actors based on person-knowledge (i.e., likeability vis-à-vis their body of work) versus perceptual cues (i.e., attractiveness). 

Because it has also been implicated in the relatively more spontaneous retrieval of person-knowledge , we also explored neural responses to the availability and use of person-knowledge in the DMPFC. We anticipated that this region may be particularly sensitive to the availability of person-knowledge when it is not explicitly required for evaluations. 



## Results 
  
### ROI analyses 
  
Our primary analyses focused on the VMPFC as our a priori ROI. We conducted exploratory analyses for other regions relevant to person evaluation, including the DMPFC. Because all effects in the DMPFC were non-significant, we report only results from the VMPFC here. (See Supplementary Material   for full results from all exploratory ROIs.) 

#### Do evaluations based on person-knowledge or attractiveness modulate VMPFC activity? 
  
We first examined whether increased positive evaluations led to greater VMPFC activity when those evaluations were based on (1) perceptual cues without person-knowledge (i.e., models rated on attractiveness), (2) perceptual cues with available person-knowledge (i.e., actors rated on attractiveness), and (3) person-knowledge (i.e., actors rated on body of work). Ratings provided in the scanner were included as parametric predictors separately for each of the three conditions in our design (see Materials and Methods). We then conducted separate one-sample t-tests on parameter estimates for each of the three parametric predictors (i.e., models rated on attractiveness, actors rated on attractiveness, and actors rated on likability based on body of work) compared to zero. This analysis was conducted to examine the potential involvement of the VMPFC in supporting positive ratings within each condition separately. 

We observed a significant VMPFC involvement for evaluations based on perceptual cues with available person-knowledge (i.e., actors rated on attractiveness),   t  (54) = 2.672,   p   = 0.010, such that VMPFC activity increased as ratings of attractiveness for actors became more positive. We also observed significant VMPFC involvement for evaluations based on person-knowledge (i.e., actors rated on likability based on body of work),   t  (54) = 3.660,   p   < 0.001, such that VMPFC activity increased as ratings of likability based on body of work became more positive. However, we did not observe a significant VMPFC involvement for percept-based evaluations made in the absence of person-knowledge (viz., models rated on attractiveness),   t  (54) = 0.678,   p   = 0.501. Taken together, these results indicate that the VMPFC is sensitive to positive evaluations when person-knowledge is available, irrespective of whether that person-knowledge is directly relevant to evaluations. 


#### Do person evaluations modulate VMPFC activity more when person-knowledge is used or when it’s simply available? 
  
To examine whether sensitivity to positive ratings was especially pronounced for a particular condition (e.g., use of person-knowledge: actors’ body of work) relative to other conditions (e.g., mere presence of person-knowledge: actors’ attractiveness), we next conducted a one-way ANOVA on parameter estimates to detect the presence of any differences amongst the parametric predictors. 

The results indicated that the parametric predictors differed in magnitude: significant effect of parametric predictor on VMPFC activity,   F  (2,162) = 3.479,   p   = 0.033. We followed up on this finding by conducting linear regressions to test all possible pair-wise contrasts between the parametric predictors. We found evidence of a significant linear relationship between positive ratings and the combined availability/use of person-knowledge (contrast codes: parametric predictor for actors’ body of work = 0.5, parametric predictor for actors’ attractiveness = 0, and parametric predictor for models’ attractiveness = −0.5),   b   = 0.753,   SE   = 0.288,   CI   = [0.188, 1.317],   F  (1,163) = 6.833,   p   = 0.010. Specifically, VMPFC activity increased more as ratings of likability based on body of work for actors became more positive compared to when ratings of attractiveness for models became more positive. No other significant differences emerged: (1) ratings of likability based on body of work for actors compared to ratings of attractiveness for actors,   b   = 0.276,   SE   = 0.293,   CI   = [−0.298, 0.851],   F  (1,163) = 0.889,   p   = 0.347; and (2) ratings of attractiveness for actors compared to ratings of attractiveness for models,   b   = 0.477,   SE   = 0.292,   CI   = [−0.095, 1.048],   F  (1,163) = 2.670,   p   = 0.104. Taken together, these results indicate that the VMPFC is particularly sensitive to the use of available person-knowledge relative to the absence of person-knowledge (Fig.  ).

We conducted pair-wise contrasts of VMPFC parameter estimates for the parametric predictors when participants were rating actors on likability based on body of work (i.e., person-knowledge available and necessary), actors on attractiveness (i.e., person-knowledge available and unnecessary), and models on attractiveness (i.e., person-knowledge unavailable and unnecessary). Results indicate that VMPFC activity is particularly sensitive to the use of available person-knowledge relative to the absence of person-knowledge. The significant simple effect (*) is indicated,   p   = 0.010. All other pair-wise contrasts were non-significant,   p   > 0.104. 
  



### Exploratory whole-brain analyses 
  
Complementing our a priori focus on the VMPFC, we conducted exploratory whole-brain analyses to determine whether (1) any other regions (e.g., DMPFC) would show a similar pattern of activity to that observed in the VMPFC ROI and (2) the activity observed in our a priori ROI analysis would be robust to multiple comparison correction at the whole-brain level. 

#### Analysis parameters 
  
Separate whole-brain analyses at the second level were performed to examine increases and decreases in neural activity as a function of in-scanner ratings provided during each of the three conditions: (1) actors rated on body of work, (2) actors rated on attractiveness, and (3) models rated on attractiveness. Using the Monte Carlo simulations included in AlphaSim, the minimum cluster size required for a whole-brain correction at   p   < 0.05 with an uncorrected threshold of   p   < 0.001 was estimated to be 51 contiguous voxels. We summarize results from each of the whole-brain analyses below. The results for all analyses are reported in Table  .

#### Impact of person-knowledge use (actors rated on body of work only) 
  
We observed greater activity in the calcarine sulcus, VMPFC, and superior occipital cortex as body-of-work ratings increased for the actors, but no reliable changes as body-of-work ratings decreased (Fig.  ). These findings converge with the ROI findings reported above showing that VMPFC activity was sensitive to increasing positivity in body-of-work ratings for well-known actors.

Increased body-of-work ratings for the actors were associated with increasing activity in the VMPFC (peak MNI  = [6, 63, 0]). 
  


#### Impact of person-knowledge availability (actors rated on attractiveness only) 
  
We observed greater activity in the lingual gyrus as attractiveness ratings increased for the actors, but no reliable changes as attractiveness ratings decreased. Although the VMPFC was reliably modulated by increasingly positive ratings of actor attractiveness in our reported ROI analyses, this region did not survive thresholds for multiple comparison in this corresponding whole-brain analysis. 


#### Impact of percept-based evaluations without person-knowledge (models rated on attractiveness only) 
  
We observed greater activity in the superior parietal gyrus as attractiveness ratings decreased for the actors, but no reliable changes as attractiveness ratings increased. 



### Supplementary Analyses Controlling for Post-scan Stimulus Familiarity 
  
In order to see if differences in perceptual familiarity (and not differences in person-knowledge, as hypothesized) could account for differences arising between comparisons of actors and models rated on attractiveness, we conducted analyses while controlling for post-scan familiarity ratings in Supplementary Material  . Specifically, we re-analyzed the ROI data while accounting for post-scan familiarity ratings as a parametric modulator in the level-1 GLM. Results from these analyses were consistent with the corresponding original ROI analyses reported in the main text and Supplementary Material  , suggesting that perceptual familiarity is unlikely to account for these differences. 

Finally, in order to account for post-scan ratings of familiarity in the whole-brain exploratory analyses reported in the preceding section, we also re-analyzed these data while accounting for post-scan familiarity ratings as an additional parametric modulator in the level-1 GLM for each of the three whole-brain parametric analyses (see Supplementary Material  ). With the exception of clusters in the parietal cortex (see Supplementary Material  ), results from the whole brain analyses were consistent with the whole-brain findings reported in the preceding section (cf. Table   and Fig.  ). 


### General Discussion 
  
The goal of the current study was to examine how VMPFC activity is impacted by the availability and use of person-knowledge. Our findings indicate that the VMPFC is especially sensitive to the use of available person-knowledge but also to a lesser extent to the availability of person-knowledge. Moreover, person-knowledge may be spontaneously used in evaluations of others even when such knowledge is not necessary for the task at hand, such as when judging familiar people based on their attractiveness. Although existing research has implicated the VMPFC in explicitly assessed positive evaluations based on person-knowledge and, to a lesser extent, based on perceptual cues, these two forms of explicit evaluation have not been directly compared in a single brain imaging study. 

Importantly, our predictions for the involvement of the VMPFC in positive explicit evaluations when person-knowledge was available were confirmed. VMPFC was more involved in increasingly positive evaluations when person-knowledge was required compared to when person-knowledge was unavailable. Although VMPFC activity also tracked with increasingly positive evaluations when person-knowledge was available but not necessary for evaluation, the magnitude of this relationship did not differ relative to the non-significant relationship between VMPFC activity and positive evaluations in the absence of person-knowledge. In contrast, our prediction that the VMPFC would be involved in positively evaluating others regardless of person-knowledge availability was not supported. It appears that the VMPFC may be less involved in evaluations of others based solely on perceptual cues in the absence of person-knowledge. 

There are several key take-aways from these findings. First, results suggest that when person-knowledge is available it influences how we evaluate others, even when the knowledge in question is not necessary for the judgment at hand. Second, VMPFC may be particularly involved in the implementation of person evaluations requiring the use of person-knowledge. Third, the current findings suggest that contributions from the VMPFC to explicit evaluations critically depend on the presence of person-knowledge. In other words, this region does not appear to support positive evaluations based on a perceptual attribute in the absence of person-knowledge. Finally, these effects were observed in the VMPFC, but not the DMPFC (see Supplementary Material  ), illustrating an important divergence in the medial prefrontal cortex during explicit social evaluations, at least when person-knowledge is available. 

Consistent with previous research, the VMPFC is not always sensitive to attractiveness in the absence of person-knowledge . Indeed, with respect to attractiveness ratings, the VMPFC only showed enhanced sensitivity to ratings of attractiveness when person-knowledge about the targets was available (i.e., actors). These results provide further evidence of an extended neural system supporting the various aspects of person perception . In particular, the VMPFC may be spontaneously sensitive to the availability of person-knowledge, even when that person-knowledge is not needed (e.g., when evaluating the attractiveness of familiar actors). 

The VMPFC’s spontaneous sensitivity to person-knowledge during social evaluations is noteworthy given evidence that the DMPFC may also be involved in the spontaneous use of person-knowledge. However, one key difference is that the present study involved explicit evaluations. With few exceptions , studies finding sensitivity in the DMPFC to valenced person-knowledge have tended to rely on indirect comparisons. At least during the critical contrasts reported in these studies, person-knowledge was not used for direct and explicit evaluations (e.g., impression consistency judgments , n-back task ). Even when critical analyses involve explicit evaluations, the DMPFC is not directly sensitive to increasingly positive evaluations of others. Instead, the DMPFC appears to be sensitive to evaluative inconsistency  or impression updating based on evaluatively inconsistent information . For studies reporting DMPFC sensitivity to impression updating as a function of the valence of new information, the DMPFC is either not sensitive to valence  or shows increased activity to increasingly   negative   impression updating . This contrasts with the present finding that activity in the VMPFC (but not the DMPFC) tracks increasingly   positive   evaluations based on person-knowledge. Rather than directly indexing the valence of explicit evaluations based on person-knowledge as in the VMPFC, we speculate that the DMPFC is sensitive to potentially diagnostic person-knowledge that conflicts with an existing impression. Because participants in this study were not systematically presented with evaluatively inconsistent information (e.g., unattractive actors whose body of work is nonetheless impressive), it is perhaps to be expected that we did not observe activity in the DMPFC as a function of explicit evaluations or otherwise. 

The present study also raises the question of whether the VMPFC is involved in the integration of the evaluative impact of perceptual and knowledge-based cues on social evaluations even when one or more of these cues are irrelevant to the explicit evaluation at hand. To better understand whether perceptual and knowledge-based information are integrated (vs. processed in parallel) in the VMPFC, future work will need to examine these processes in a more orthogonal fashion. For example, evaluating actors’ likability based on their body of work in the absence of perceptual cues (e.g., using names rather than faces) would provide a useful contrast with the same rating in the presence of both facial cues and person-knowledge. Greater VMPFC activity when rating actors’ body of work after seeing their faces compared with their names would provide clearer support that the VMPFC is involved in the integration of the evaluative impact from perceptual cues and person-knowledge. 

Complementing our ROI approach, the whole-brain analyses provided convergent information about the role played by the VMPFC in person evaluation. Consistent with our ROI analyses of the VMPFC, we observed greater activity as body-of-work ratings increased for the actors. As mentioned previously, this pattern did not manifest in the DMPFC. However, we did observe effects in bilateral amygdala that were similar to those observed in the VMPFC ROI (see Supplementary Material  ). 

Contrasting with the observed effects of person-knowledge in this study, we observed few effects of increasingly positive evaluations in percept-based evaluations (i.e., attractiveness judgments) in the whole-brain (see Results) or exploratory ROI analyses (see Supplementary Material  ). Regions emerging in analyses of attractiveness ratings (actors or models) did not coincide with areas previously implicated in reward or attractiveness (e.g., ventral striatum) . It is possible that variability in another trait that is frequently conveyed through both perceptual and knowledge-based antecedents (e.g., competence ) may better delineate networks implicated in evaluations based on perceptual (vs. knowledge-based) cues. 

In the current study, we used actors with whom participants were already familiar and therefore were not able to experimentally control for exact amount of information known about the actors. Nonetheless, we did attempt to control for effects of familiarity in our models in a set of supplemental analyses (see Supplementary Material  ). Results from these supplementary analyses were consistent with those reported in the main text, suggesting that perceptual familiarity is unlikely to account for observed differences, particularly those arising in the contrast of actors versus models for attractiveness ratings. Future research should explore how the amount and kind of knowledge impacts neural networks involved in person evaluation. Furthermore, it is worth nothing that there may not have been as much variability in the negativity of the targets utilized in the current study (in either attractiveness or body-of-work judgments; see Supplementary Material  ). As such, it would be useful in future research to provide participants with varying amounts of person-knowledge about novel individuals that equally varies in positivity and negativity. This would allow for a more systematic examination of the relative impact of valence and amount of knowledge on networks supporting person evaluation. Additionally, as our sample only included male participants, the current findings may not generalize to female participants because evaluations of attractiveness may be sensitive to perceiver gender . However, it remains unclear how perceiver gender might affect evaluations based on person-knowledge. 

In conclusion, our findings indicate that activity in the VMPFC is sensitive to positive evaluations when person-knowledge is available, irrespective of whether that knowledge is relevant to one’s evaluation. Previous research has found that key components of the extended brain networks supporting person perception are especially sensitive to faces associated with person-knowledge . It will be critical for future research to examine the role of the VMPFC within this broader neural network, and particularly the degree to which this region may support the dynamic integration of perceptual and knowledge-based information during person evaluation and impression formation . 



## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Sixty-one self-identified White male participants were recruited from the Chicago area via leaflets, online postings, and advertisements on public transportation for monetary compensation ($60–105). See Supplementary Material   for screening procedures. Six participants who completed the study were excluded due to an incomplete post-scan familiarity questionnaire (  n   = 1), in-scanner ratings not being recorded (  n   = 1), excessive movement in the scanner (  n   = 1), and familiarity with the model stimuli and/or lack of familiarity with actor stimuli (  n   = 3; see Procedures and Supplementary Material  ). The remaining 55 participants were 18–35 years old (  M   = 24.255 years,   SD   = 4.608 years) and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Although this final sample size was approximately twice the size of an average fMRI study, it nonetheless falls short of recommended sample sizes for whole-brain across-participant analyses that adequately account for multiple comparisons  (  n   > 80). Following the recommendation of Vul and Pashler , we therefore focus our analyses on an a priori ROI. Previous analyses indicate that sample sizes needed for adequate power can be reduced by three to four times by adopting an ROI-based approach . Participants provided informed consent in accordance with the experimental protocol approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Review Board and in accordance with the guidelines set by the Declaration of Helsinki. 


### Actor-Model task 
  
#### Stimuli and stimulus equating 
  
After piloting (see Supplementary Material  ), we curated a sample of 90 faces for the fMRI task: 30 actors and 15 models of each gender. These stimuli were equated by independent samples of online raters (see Supplementary Material  ). For each rating dimension, we ran a 2 (Person-knowledge: well-known actors, unknown models) × 2 (Gender: male, female) repeated-measures ANOVA. The final stimuli were of average attractiveness and young to middle-aged. Males were significantly more dominant than females, but dominance did not vary by occupation. Actors were significantly more familiar and likeable than models, but neither rating varied by gender. Body-of-work ratings indicated that the work of both genders was similarly rated as average. Because the stimuli necessitated the use of photos of actors and models from unstandardized online sources, it was difficult to obtain and equate only photographs of neutral faces. Therefore, only stimuli with a happy or neutral expression were selected. However, facial expression did not statistically differ from an expected distribution of 2/3 neutral and 1/3 happy faces in each occupation-by-gender condition. 


#### fMRI task design 
  
The actor-model task consisted of an event-related design with two counterbalanced functional runs. The equated selection of 60 actors and 30 models was divided into two sets of 30 unique actors and two sets of 15 unique models, respectively. Each participant rated each of the 60 actors once on a single dimension (attractiveness or body of work) and each of the 30 models once on attractiveness. 

In addition to counterbalancing the assignment of face set to runs (run 1 vs. run 2), the assignment of individual faces to evaluative rating conditions (attractiveness vs. body of work), and the assignment of response keys (ascending vs. descending), we also counterbalanced the order in which participants completed the three conditions within each run. The block orders of the two runs were completely orthogonal (i.e., no blocks were presented in the same location of the block sequence across runs). Accounting for the above factors, each participant completed one of 48 versions of the experiment. (See Supplementary Material   more details.) 

Before each block, participants saw a brief cue consisting of the rating dimension and target occupation (e.g., “How attractive are these actors?”). All trials were presented on a black background and consisted of a face presented for 1500 ms followed by a 500-ms white fixation. Next, a green fixation appeared prompting participants to provide their rating (i.e., attractiveness or likability based on body of work: see Fig.  ). Responses were given on a counterbalanced four-point scale. After 1000 ms, the green fixation was replaced by a final 1000-ms white fixation. Altogether, each trial lasted 4000 ms, and participants had a window from 1500–3500 ms post-stimulus onset to both form their evaluation and respond using the button box. Post-trial jittering was pseudorandomly interleaved, using 0-, 2000-, 4000-, or 6000-ms fixations (Fig.  ). Stimulus presentation and data collection were in E-Prime 2.0 Professional ( ).   
Trial sequence for the actor–model fMRI task. Over the course of the experiment (i.e., two fMRI runs), participants evaluated 30 unique actors on attractiveness, 30 unique actors on body of work, and all 30 models on attractiveness. The silhouette presented here represents a picture of either an actor or model stimulus. Each run was split into three counterbalanced blocks, each of which began with a prompt indicating the evaluative dimension and the target type (e.g., “How attractive are these actors?”). 
  



### Procedure 
  
In the context of a larger study, participants completed online demographic and unrelated individual differences questionnaires at home (see Supplementary Material  ). (For all experiments, we have reported all measures, conditions, data exclusions, and sample size determinations either in the main text or supplementary material.) Then participants received a list of the actors with links to their online profiles along with instructions to study the actors. Prior to coming into the lab for scanning, participants had to get 100% correct on an online quiz in which they had to identify one of two movies or write in a different movie casting that actor. This was done to ensure the participants were familiar with the actors’ body of work. 

Upon arriving for their scanning session, participants gave informed consent and received task instructions. Outside of the scanner, participants then completed a practice block consisting of a shortened version of the main experiment (one run consisting of one 10-trial block for each of the three conditions) conducted on a computer with actors and models that would not appear in the actual study. Participants were then trained on an impression-formation task unrelated to the current investigation  (see Supplementary Material   for full procedures). 

Participants then completed the actor-model task in the scanner. After this, participants completed two runs of the unrelated impression-formation task. Finally, resting-state and anatomical scans were acquired if time allowed. Post-scan, participants completed questionnaires unrelated to the present investigation (see Supplementary Material  ). In order to verify that our participants were indeed familiar with the actors and unfamiliar with the models (who were selected to be unfamiliar based on ratings from an independent sample), participants indicated their familiarity with all actors and models viewed in the scanner on a 9-point scale from 1 “Extremely Unfamiliar” to 9 “Extremely Familiar”. For analyses that parallel those in the results section but while accounting for these familiarity ratings, see Supplementary Material  . 


### Data analysis 
  
#### Trial- and participant-level exclusions 
  
For each participant with complete fMRI and behavioral data sets (  n   = 58), we excluded from analyses: (1) all trials in which the participant did not provide an in-scanner rating, (2) all actors that the participant rated as somewhat to very unfamiliar (i.e., 1–5 on the post-scan familiarity ratings), and (3) all models that the participant rated as appearing somewhat to very familiar (i.e., 4–9 on the post-scan familiarity ratings) (see Supplementary Material   for exclusions). Only 58 out of 104,400 trials were eliminated due to missing in-scanner ratings. After all trial-level exclusions, three participants were ultimately eliminated for having fewer than six trials per rating dimension (i.e., actors rated on attractiveness, models rated on attractiveness, and actors rated on body of work). The remaining 55 participants’ data were analyzed. The means and standard deviations of the three in-scanner rating conditions were as follows: actors rated on attractiveness,   M   = 2.907,   SD   = 0.414; models rated on attractiveness,   M   = 2.762,   SD   = 0.339; and actors rated on body of work,   M   = 3.142,   SD   = 0.318. These mean ratings were all significantly different from each other (see Supplementary Material   for full statistics). Within participants, we generally observed similar variability (i.e., participant-specific standard deviations in trial-level responses) for each of the three conditions,   F  (2,159) = 0.376,   p   = 0.687: actors rated on attractiveness,   M   = 0.825; models rated on attractiveness,   M   = 0.837; and actors rated on body of work,   M   = 0.856. 


#### fMRI data acquisition and analysis 
  
Anatomical and functional whole-brain imaging were performed using a Philips Achieva 3.0-T scanner and 32-channel head coil at the University of Chicago MRI Research Center. Functional images in the form of 30 oblique slices were collected using Z-shim acquisition in 2 runs of 163 TRs each, using pulse sequence parameters (TR/TE = 2000/25 ms, flip angle = 77°, interleaved slices with 4.0-mm thickness, 0.5-mm gap, FOV = 192 × 134 × 192 mm, approximately 64 × 64-mm matrix). The order of slice acquisition varied across participants, depending on the location of the four z-shim slices . High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired in the sagittal plane using a 3D Turbo Field Echo (TFE/MP-RAGE) anatomical scan (TR = 8.0 ms, TE = 3.5 ms, FOV = 228 × 240 × 181 mm, 1.0-mm slice thickness, no gap, 240 × 240-mm matrix). Then thin-slice resting-state scans were collected (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 29.5 ms, FOV = 240 × 138 × 240 mm, slice thickness = 2.6 mm with a 1.4-mm gap, an in-plane resolution of 3.75 mm , and a flip angle of 77°). 

  GLM   . Functional MRI data were analyzed using general linear models (GLM) in SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Analyses were facilitated by a custom suite of scripts for fMRI analysis ( ). Data were preprocessed to remove sources of noise and artifacts. Images were realigned within and across runs to correct for head movement. Functional data were transformed into a standard anatomical space (3-mm isotropic voxels) based on the ICBM 152 brain template (Montreal Neurological Institute). Normalized data were then spatially smoothed using an 8-mm Gaussian kernel to increase signal-to-noise ratio and to reduce the impact of anatomical variability that was not corrected by stereotaxic normalization. 

For each participant, a GLM was constructed to examine condition-specific brain activity as a function of the participant’s in-scanner ratings (either attractiveness or likability of body of work). In-scanner ratings were coded such that larger numbers represented more positive evaluations. We used these ratings to model three regressors, each representing a linear change in neural responses within a given rating condition as condition-specific ratings increased. These regressors were incorporated as parametric predictors in each participant’s level-1 GLM. Our reported analyses focused on these three parametric predictors of interest: (1) actors evaluated on body of work (i.e., familiar others rated on person-knowledge), (2) actors evaluated on attractiveness (i.e., familiar others rated on perceptual cues), and (3) models evaluated on attractiveness (i.e., unfamiliar others rated on perceptual cues). In sum, one single GLM incorporating three regressors for each of the three conditions (i.e., non-parametric parameters), three regressors for the condition-specific parametric parameters, and additional regressors for covariates of non-interest (a session mean, a linear trend to account for low-frequency drift, and six movement parameters derived from realignment corrections) were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function and used to compute parameter estimates (  β  ) for each condition at each voxel. Resulting estimates for each participant were used in ROI analyses and exploratory whole-brain parametric analyses. 


#### VMPFC ROI 
  
ROI analyses were conducted to identify the hypothesized impact of person-knowledge and perceptual cues on evaluations. Analyses focused on an 8-mm VMPFC spherical ROI that was centered on the MNI coordinates from a previous research examining various forms of person-knowledge (e.g., financial and moral status , socio-economic status , and moral appraisals ) during social evaluations (0, 52, −6). For each participant, mean GLM parameter estimates for the VMPFC ROI were extracted for each of the three parametric predictors of interest. ROI analyses were conducted offline in R using the stats package . We first conducted one-sample t-tests to compare each parametric predictor to zero to explore whether VMPFC activity changed as a function of ratings (i.e., increased as evaluations became more positive) for each of the three conditions. Using the R function lm, a second analysis focused on the relative impact of each parametric predictor on VMPFC activity. Following up on a significant one-way ANOVA, we tested all possible pair-wise contrasts between parametric predictors by conducting three separate linear regressions each using a unique set of contrast codes: (1) parametric predictor for actors’ body of work = 0.5, parametric predictor for actors’ attractiveness = 0, and parametric predictor for models’ attractiveness = −0.5; (2) parametric predictor for actors’ body of work = 0, parametric predictor for actors’ attractiveness = 0.5, and parametric predictor for models’ attractiveness = −0.5; and (3) parametric predictor for actors’ body of work = 0.5, parametric predictor for actors’ attractiveness = −0.5, and parametric predictor for models’ attractiveness = 0). 



### Exploratory and supplementary analyses 
  
In addition to our main focus on the VMPFC, we conducted exploratory analyses on other regions of interest previously suggested to be involved in person evaluation and social cognition: DMPFC, bilateral nucleus accumbens, bilateral superior temporal sulcus, bilateral temporo-parietal junction, precuneus, and bilateral amygdala (see Supplementary Material  ). 

Additionally, we conducted exploratory whole-brain analyses (see Results) to identify additional brain regions potentially sensitive to modulation by in-scanner ratings in each of the three conditions: (1) person-knowledge use (i.e., actors rated on body of work only), (2) person-knowledge availability (i.e., actors rated on attractiveness only), and (3) percept-based evaluations without person-knowledge (i.e., models rated on attractiveness only). 

Finally, we also conducted supplementary ROI and whole-brain analyses controlling for post-scan ratings of stimulus familiarity in order to control for any remaining effects of familiarity (see Supplementary Material  ).

# Abstract
 
The brain networks underlying human   multiple-cue judgment  , the judgment of a continuous criterion based on multiple cues, have been examined in a few recent studies, and the ventral precuneus has been found to be a key region. Specifically, activation differences in   ventral precuneus   (as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) has been linked to an exemplar-based judgment process, where judgments are based on memory for previous similar cases. Ventral precuneus is implicated in various episodic memory processes, notably such that   increased   activity during learning in this region as well as in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the medial temporal lobes (MTL) have been linked to retrieval success. The present study used fMRI during a multiple-cue judgment task to gain novel neurocognitive evidence informative for the link between learning-related activity changes in ventral precuneus and exemplar-based judgment. Participants (  N   = 27) spontaneously learned to make judgments during fMRI, in a multiple-cue judgment task specifically designed to induce exemplar-based processing. Contrasting brain activity during late learning to early learning revealed   higher   activity in ventral precuneus, the bilateral MTL, and the vmPFC. Activity in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC was found to parametrically increase between each judgment event, and activity levels in the ventral precuneus predicted performance after learning. These results are interpreted such that the ventral precuneus supports the aspects of exemplar-based processes that are related to episodic memory, tentatively by building, storing, and being implicated in retrieving memory representations for judgment. 
 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
The act of multiple-cue judgment – to estimate a continuous criterion based on multiple cues – is something people engage in repeatedly in life. Consider for example how a teacher grades an essay, a car dealer estimates the price of a used car, or judges sentencing a criminal. Behavioral multiple-cue judgment research has traditionally focused on how people rely on rule-based processes, with weighted integration of each cue value, in order to make inferences. Linear regression models tend to describe such behavior well (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). However, recent behavioral research has repeatedly demonstrated that judgments like these are often influenced by similarity-based comparisons to previously experienced similar situations stored in memory, a process that is well described by exemplar-based models (EBMs) (c.f.  ;  ; see e.g.,  ,  ). It has even been suggested that similarity-based strategies are hard to resist when making inferences ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). 

Recently, this research was extended with brain imaging data demonstrating that the medial parietal cortex, specifically the ventral precuneus, might be key for a similarity-based judgment process ( ). In that study, looking at brain activation in a test phase after learning, the ventral precuneus was activated compared to baseline in four different multiple-cue judgment conditions (  N   = 74), during both rule-based and similarity-based judgment processes. Interestingly, activity in this region predicted how well an EBM, but not a rule-based model, fit judgment data, raising the intriguing possibility that the role for ventral precuneus in human multiple-cue judgment is related to similarity-based processes ( ). 

Precuneus has received relatively little attention in the previous related literature, considering it might actually be a key hub for human judgment. Partly, this can be explained by the fact that several related studies in the field of categorization (i.e., the cognitively less demanding task where the criterion is binary instead of continuous) have focused on the logic of contrasting strategies against each other. Thus, to the extent that similarity-based processes are at play also when other strategies are executed, common activations in this brain region might have been canceled out. Similarity-based processes have instead by the logic of contrasting strategies for example been found to evoke higher activity than rule-based processes in the anterior prefrontal cortex and the inferior parietal cortex, whereas rule-based strategies instead evoke higher activity than similarity-based processes in the anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the posterior parietal cortex (e.g.,  ;  ;  ; for reviews see also  ). Another reason for why precuneus might have been overlooked can be that several categorization studies have focused on   a priori   regions of interest, for example the medial temporal lobes (MTL). For instance, some recent studies have used model-based fMRI with EBMs and have found the MTL to be involved in concept learning ( ), memory strength ( ), and typicality of a memory representation used for exemplar-based similarity comparison ( ). Others have detailed the neurocognitive processes involved in human category learning, without explicit reference to similarity-based processes   per se  , but with converging evidence for the involvement of the basal ganglia ( ;  ;  ; for a review see  ) and cortico-striatal loops (e.g.,  ). Finally, yet another reason precuneus have not been stressed in research on similarity-based judgment processes could be that judgment and categorization require different responses, where activity necessary for judgment might not necessarily be evoked in a categorization task, and vice versa. In one of the very few existing imaging studies of multiple-cue judgment,   demonstrated that making test-phase judgments with an exemplar-based strategy was associated with higher activity in the inferior parietal cortex and the inferior prefrontal cortex compared to a heuristic rule-based process, whereas a rule-based condition engaged the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, precentral gyrus, and temporo-parietal regions more than an exemplar-based strategy. The reason that precuneus was not observed in that study could again be related to the possibility that the subtraction logic canceled out shared activity in precuneus. Notably, the ventral precuneus was recently found to be more engaged in an exemplar-based judgment condition compared to a rule-based judgment condition in a multiple-cue judgment task even though the conditions were directly contrasted ( ) implying that experimental design might also be an important factor. 

To the extent that ventral precuneus should be linked to exemplar-based processes, there are different possibilities pertaining to the role of this region in this type of process. One possibility is that the ventral precuneus is related to the   mnemonic representational   aspects necessary for exemplar-based processes in human multiple-cue judgment. The ventral precuneus has been extensively linked to episodic memory ( ;  ;  ; for a review see  ) and has been found to re-activate for stimuli that are familiar due to recent exposure (the encoding-retrieval flip, for overviews see  ;  ). In addition, increased activity in the ventral precuneus, the MTL and the vmPFC during learning reflect mnemonic processing during encoding, and later retrieval success (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). One hypothesis could thus be that the ventral precuneus in a similar manner could support exemplar-based judgment, with increased activity during learning as a function of more established memory representations used for judgment. 

There are also other alternatives to how the link between the ventral precuneus and exemplar-based processes could be understood. For example, activity changes in precuneus could be related to   visuo-spatial attention   with the demands of attending to stimuli with multiple attributes (see e.g., for a review  ). Damage to this region has been shown to result in difficulties attending to a visual stimulus ( ) and has been reported when maintaining attention in an orientation discrimination task in healthy participants ( ). Moreover, the precuneus, including the ventral areas, routinely exhibits reduced activity over time in perceptually attention demanding cognitive tasks together with the vmPFC (e.g.,  ;  ). Thus, an alternative hypothesis could be that the ventral precuneus exhibit reduced activation during learning related to decreased attentional demands of performing a multiple-cue judgment task. 

In the present study we aimed to use event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during judgment learning to investigate how ventral precuneus plays a role in exemplar-based processes and whether this role should be characterized as reflecting mnemonic representational aspects, or visuo-spatial attention. If an exemplar-based process in the ventral precuneus is key for human judgment, we should see changes in this region during the learning phase. If so, we hypothesized that, if the ventral precuneus is involved in building memory representations for exemplar-based judgment, an   increased   BOLD signal should be observed in a number of   a priori   regions of interest: the ventral precuneus, the MTL and the vmPFC, during the course of learning. Higher activity in the ventral precuneus toward the end of learning was also expected to be directly related to performance on the learning items after learning, connecting activity levels to retrieval success (e.g.,  ;  ; for reviews see  ;  ;  ). On the other hand, if the ventral precuneus is rather involved in directing attention toward the different features of stimuli with multiple attributes, we hypothesized that a   reduction   of activity should be observed in the ventral precuneus during the course of learning (see e.g.,  ;  ) as a function of the task being less and less attentionally demanding. Finally, if brain activity in this region was in addition observed to be significantly higher than baseline across all scanned blocks, and this activity was functionally related to the fit of an EBM after learning, this would provide further support the suggestion that ventral precuneus is a key brain region multiple-cue judgment, and exemplar-based processes specifically ( ). 

During scanning, participants (young and healthy) spontaneously learned a multiple-cue judgment task based on a biological scenario. A multiplicative relationship between cue and criterion was applied, successfully used to induce exemplar-based processes in past behavioral studies (e.g.,  ;  ) and two imaging studies ( ;  ). It has been demonstrated that when it is difficult to rely on a linear weighted rule, for example when the cue-combination rule is multiplicative, and people spontaneously adhere to an exemplar-based strategy (see e.g.,  ;  ). 

The experimental set up was designed to yield large differences in cognitive model predictions on the final test phase judgments between rule-based and EBMs, in order to confirm that the task manipulation described above had been successful. Some items were introduced during learning (training items) and a set of new items at test, and the behavioral responses were used to verify the models predictions. An EBM predicts that stored learning items will be retrieved from memory to make a judgment of new test items, with better performance for old than for new items and an inability to extrapolate to criterion values outside the acquired learning range ( ;  ). A linear regression model on the other hand, where each cue is expected to be considered with a weighted linear rule, make no such predictions. The predicted differences in behavioral response, and the better model fit on test-phase data, was used to verify that participants spontaneously adopted an exemplar-based process in this task (see e.g.,  ,  ;  ). 

The critical comparison with regards to the brain imaging data concerned BOLD signal differences between late and early learning. Further characterization of activity changes in the brain regions for which we had   a priori   predictions (i.e., the ventral precuneus, MTL, and the vmPFC) included three   post hoc   tests to explicitly test for changes as a function of learning, and a correlation test to establish a link between the ventral precuneus activity and performance on training items (see section “Materials and Methods” for details). 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
A total of 34 participants (17 females;   M   = 24.9; Range = 20–38 years,   SD   = 4.54) were recruited at Umeå University through public advertisement. Participants were right-handed by self-report, met the criteria for MR-scanning (no metallic implants, not pregnant), were neurologically healthy, had no dyslexia or dyscalculia, and had not participated in previous similar studies. All participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. All procedures were approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Umeå, Sweden. Participants received 500 SEK for participation in the experiment. An extra bonus of maximally 200 SEK could be earned based on performance (  M   = 124.9 SEK  , SD   = 31.29 SEK). 

Data from seven participants had to be discarded from all analyses: one participant did not reach the learning criterion, and six participants failed to complete all phases of the experiment. One additional participant was discarded from the brain imaging analyses because model fit of final test-phase data was numerically better by the rule-based model than by the EBM (see section “Results” for details). 


### Design and Materials 
  
In a within-subjects design, the task was to learn to judge the toxicity of fictional “tropical death-bugs” on a pseudo-continuous scale with outcome feedback, a task used in several previous studies on multiple-cue judgment to study rule-based and exemplar-based strategies (see e.g.,  ,  ;  ;  ). The toxicity (the criterion) ranged between 2 and 28. The death-bugs differed on four binary cues (i.e., body parts) that affected the toxicity; the legs (long or short), the eyes (big or small), the head (dotted or striped) and the body (blue or purple). 

To induce spontaneous adoption of an exemplar-based judgment strategy, we applied a task manipulation previously successfully used to make participants spontaneously learn to perform multiple-cue judgments with an exemplar-based strategy over a rule-based strategy (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). It has repeatedly been shown that when a linear rule cannot be applied, as for example with a multiplicative relationship between cue and criterion, people tend to rely on exemplar-based strategies instead ( ;  ;  ). To relate to this work, the cue-combination rule used to calculate the toxicity was a multiplicative function of the cues: 

where each cue,   C   , C   , C  , and   C   could take a cue-value of −1 or 1 (see  ). For example, a death bug with the cue values (−1, −1, −1, −1) had a toxicity of 2, and a death-bug with the cue-weights (1, 1, 1, 1) had a toxicity of 28 (see  ). The cue weights, as well as which binary feature of the death-bug that implied toxicity, were randomly assigned for each participant.

### Procedures 
  
The experiment consisted of four sessions that were administered the same day. Participants began with a   familiarization session   outside the scanner where they were familiarized with the procedure for the fMRI judgment task and a few practice trials related to the cognitive-perceptual baseline task (dot-bug judgment task); judging whether a bug with similar resemblance to the death-bug had gray dots located on its body. The stimuli used in the familiarization session was unrelated to the main task in order to facilitate experience of the trial design and response mode but at the same time maintain novice to the to-be-learnt material before the start of the actual data collection. Participants were then informed about the   fMRI judgment session   where they should learn to judge the toxicity of a number of death-bugs with outcome feedback while being in the scanner. The death-bug judgment task was randomly alternated with the dot-bug judgment task (five items in each learning block) where participants were asked where on a bug dots were located; at the top, the bottom, or both. The structure of the dot-bug judgment task was identical to the death-bug judgment task on all aspects except that no outcome feedback was provided. Participants received no explicit instructions on how to solve the task. 

Following the fMRI judgment session was a   behavioral judgment session  , including a   final test phase  , where participants continued to make judgments of death-bugs but outside of the scanner. Lastly, there was a   questionnaire session  , where participants answered questions regarding participants background, motivation, task difficulty, and knowledge on how the bodily features of the death bugs affected the toxicity. 

#### fMRI Judgment Session 
  
The task was displayed on a 32 inches computer screen inside the scanner. The participants viewed the screen through a mirror attached to the head coil. E-prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., United States) was used to control stimuli presentation and logging of responses. A Lumitouch fMRI optical response four button keypad (Photon Control Inc., Canada) was used to collect responses. Participants entered the scanner where they learned to estimate the toxicity of the items from the training set (see  ) with outcome feedback of the correct numerical response. The session consisted of four   learning blocks  , wherein each of the 10 training items (death-bug judgment task) were presented twice in random order, in addition to the dot-bug judgment task (one block totaled 25 number of trials). In between each learning block was an   intermediate test phase  , used for cognitive modeling. See   for an illustration of the experimental design and the fMRI trial design during learning and intermediate test, respectively.

(C)   Displays model fit for the cue-abstraction model and exemplar-model on the intermediate tests (denoted T1, T2, T3, and T4) and the final test (denoted FT) reported in RMSD between participants judgment and model prediction. Note that a lower value on the   y  -axis reflects a better model fit. The blue bars display model fit to the cue-abstraction model. The red bars display model fit to the exemplar-based model (EBM). Error bars denote 95% CI around the mean.   (D)   displays performance reported in RMSE (root mean square error) between participants judgments and criteria to the learning criterion has been met (1.5 RMSE). The purple section displays RMSE on learning blocks performed during the fMRI judgment session. White bars display RMSE on learning blocks performed during the behavioral judgment session. Error bars denote 95% CI around the mean. Note that the last two bars include one participant only. 
  
On each trial, participants first viewed a small circle in the middle of the screen (8–12 s,  ). A gray cross hair (rest) was then presented which after a while changed color from gray to red (after 4–12 s). Participants were told to press the key with their right ring finger to indicate that they identified the color change. A probe with information text about the coming task was presented on the screen, either   death-bug   or   dot-bug   (2–8 s). Next, the stimuli to-be-judged (either a pictorial death bug or a dot bug) was presented for a maximum of 10 s. Participants were asked to make a judgment while the stimuli were displayed on the screen: either judging the toxicity of the displayed death-bug, or determining where dots were located, and press a button when they had formed their judgment. A jittered cross hair appeared when the button had been pressed or, if no button was pressed, after 10 s, and stayed on the screen for 2–6 s. That was followed by a scale where participants used their right-hand fingers to step to the location on the scale that matched their judgment. The scale was either ranging from 0 to 30 (for the death-bug trials) or with three alternatives (for the dot-bug trials; bottom, top or both). When a scale confirmation button had been pressed, or after 10 s, the pictorial death-bug became visible on the screen again together with the participants response and the correct numerical criterion as feedback (for 5 s). This was followed by the next trial (see  ). 

One intermediate test was administered in between each of the four learning blocks that was scanned, yielding a total of four intermediate tests. In each intermediate test, four training items and four new items (denoted New Intermediate in  ) were judged twice in random order without feedback (yielding a total of 16 trials). No brain image acquisition was performed during the intermediate tests, and therefore no jittering was applied (see   for test trial design). 


#### Behavioral Judgment Session 
  
The fourth intermediate test was administered immediately after the fMRI judgment session was completed, and took place in a room next to the scanner. After the fourth intermediate test, participants continued learning to judge the toxicity of the 10 training items until a learning criterion was met (RMSE between criterion and participants judgments ≤1.5 RMSE). The learning criterion was employed to ensure that all participants mastered the task about equally well at the end of learning. 

After the criterion was met, there was a   final test phase  , where participants judged all training and all new items twice in random order without outcome feedback (see  ). Responses in the final test phase were used for cognitive modeling to confirm that participants had chosen to master the task with an exemplar-based strategy (see section “Quantitative Model Fit”). The trial design of the final test phase was identical to the intermediate test design ( ), but participants had 20 s (instead of ten) to complete the task. The purpose of the additional time was to maximize the quality of the data. 

Lastly, participants answered a questionnaire with follow-up questions in the   questionnaire session   (results not reported here). 



### Behavioral Data Analysis 
  
#### Quantitative Model Fit 
  
An EBM and a rule-based model (cue-abstraction model, CAM) were implemented in order to infer what strategy participants had relied on (see e.g.,  ,  ;  ;  ). The EBM assumes that judgment is based on the similarity of the to-be-judged stimuli and the memory of previously encountered exemplars (i.e., the training set). The numerical judgment   is determined by: 

where   N   is the previously encountered exemplars (10 in this particular experiment, see  ),   S   is the similarity between the to-be-judged item and the exemplar   n   and   c   the criterion value of exemplar   n  . The similarity-rule from the original context model ( ) was used to calculate the similarity between a probe and a stored exemplar x : 

where   d   represents an index of 1 if cue-values on cue-dimension   i   match (  i   = 1, …, I) and   s   [four free parameters in the interval (0,1)] if there is a mismatch. 

With CAM it is assumed that the impact of each cue on the criterion is combined to form a judgment in a linear and additive way, captured by: 

where the judgment   is a linear additive function of the cues   C  .  k   (the intercept) and ω  (the cue-weights) are free parameters (see  ). 

The models’ were fitted to participants test-phase data using a   leave-one-out   cross validation procedure ( ). For each participant, and for each of the five tests separately (the four intermediate tests and the final test), the models’ free parameters were estimated by fitting both models to all except one of the test items. A prediction for the remaining test item was rendered based on the estimated parameter values. This procedure was repeated for all test items. Unconstrained non-linear optimization with a   simplex   algorithm was used to estimate the parameters (MATLAB Inc., Natick, Mass). Goodness-of-fit was measured as the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the model’s predictions and the participant’s responses. 

To confirm that participants adhered increasingly to an exemplar-based strategy over the course of the four scanned learning blocks, a 2 (CAM vs. EBM) × 4 (intermediate tests 1–4) repeated measurements ANOVA was done with RMSD of the EBM and the CAM, respectively as dependent variables. If the sphericity assumption was violated, corrected statistics using Greenhouse Geisser was applied. Finally, to confirm that participants were better fit by the EBM than the CAM during the final test phase, that is, after the learning criterion had been met, RMSD of the EBM, and the CAM was compared with a paired-samples   t  -test. 


#### Performance 
  
Performance was measured as root mean squared error (RMSE) between the criterion values and participants judgments on the death-bug task. To confirm that learning took place during the four blocks that were scanned with fMRI, RMSE of the four blocks (1–4) was entered into a repeated measurements ANOVA. If the sphericity assumption was violated, Greenhouse Geisser corrections were applied. 

Differences in performance (RMSE) on training and new items during the final test phase was investigated with a paired samples   t  -test to accommodate the assumption of performance differences between items acquired during learning and novel test items (c.f.  ,  ). 


#### Extrapolation Index (EI) 
  
To further confirm that the behavioral responses during the final test phase was in line with what can be expected by participants adhering to a similarity-based strategy, we calculated an   extrapolation index   (EI). EI was calculated by (5): 

where   x   and   x   are a participant’s response on items with the highest and lowest toxicity level, and   p   and   p   are the predicted judgments by linear extrapolation to the same items, where the prediction was based on regressing participants judgments of the ten training items against the criteria (see  ). A total of four deviations per participant (two repetitions of each of the two extreme test items during the final test) was considered, and averaged they constituted the   EI  . If   EI   = 0, this indicates perfect linear extrapolation, and is predicted by an optimal cue-abstraction model. A negative   EI   indicates poor extrapolation behavior and is predicted by the EBM. 



### Neuroimaging Data Acquisition and Analysis 
  
#### Image Acquisition and Preprocessing 
  
Images were acquired using a 3.0 T whole body MRI system (MR 750, GE, Medical Systems) with an attached 32 channels head coil. A GE-EPI sequence with the following parameters was used: echo time (TE) 30 ms; repetition time (TR) 2000 ms; flip angle 80°; field of view (FOV) 25 cm; matrix = 96 × 96; 3.4 mm slice thickness (37 slices acquired). High-resolution T1-weighted structural images were obtained for each participant. The EPI sequence used for BOLD imaging was applied to acquire T2 -weighted images. Ten dummy-scans were performed to allow for equilibrium of the fMRI-signal before the start of the data collection. To minimize noise inside the scanner, subjects wore earplugs and headphones. Cushions were placed inside the head coil, one at each side, to minimize head movements. Functional data were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM12 (The Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, United Kingdom), implemented within an in-house program (  DataZ  ). Images were corrected for slice-timing, head movement were corrected through unwarp, and realignment. Images were spatially normalized with Dartel ( ), transformed to MNI-space, and smoothed (8 mm FWHM Gaussian filter kernel). Statistical analyses were calculated with smoothed data with a high-pass filter (128 s cutoff period) to remove low-frequency noise. 



### General Linear Model Analyses 
  
#### Changes in BOLD Signal Between Early and Late Learning 
  
The primary analyses focused on regions with a different BOLD signal during late learning compared to early learning and was identified by comparing activity from the fourth (last) scanned learning block with the first scanned learning block (i.e., block 4 > 1) and vice versa (i.e., block 1 > 4). 

In the first level analysis, individual general linear models (GLM) were estimated for each participant where the death-bug judgment task events and the dot-bug events during blocks one, two, three, and four were modeled as regressors of interest, and four regressors of no interest; rest (i.e., the cross hair, see  ) on all four blocks. The six movement parameters were included as covariates of no interest. All regressors except those associated with the head movements were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. The duration of all events was modeled by using participants’ response time for each event. For example, the death-bug judgment task events and the dot-bug events were modeled from onset to button press, whereas the rest events were modeled from onset of the crosshair to button press. First level analyses consisted of contrasts comparing death-bug judgment task events from blocks one and four used to identify regions where BOLD signal was higher late compared to early during learning (i.e., block 4 > 1) and BOLD signal that was higher early compared to late during learning (block 1 > 4). Second-level analyses consisted of one sample   t  -tests based on the contrasts defined at the first-level, in a whole-brain analysis. 

Three control analyses were performed to test the specificity of results obtained from the primary model for the contrast block 4 > 1. First, a model with the purpose to test if a tighter baseline comparison yielded results consistent with the primary model was defined. The five dot-bug judgment task events from the first learning block (block 1, early dot-bugs) and the five dot-bug judgment task events from the last learning block (block 4, late dot-bugs) were included as separate regressors in the model. A   t  -contrast [(death-bugs block 4 – dot-bugs block 4) > (death-bugs block 1 – dot-bugs block 1)] was defined at the first level, and evaluated at the second level in a one-sample   t  -test. Second, the difference between block 1 and 4 for the death-bug judgment task and the dot-bug judgment task [defined as (Task block 4 – Rest block 4) – (Task block 1 – Rest block 1)], respectively, was calculated. The purpose was to evaluate if the learning-related changes in the regions of interest were linked to the death-bug judgment task, and not the dot-bug judgment task, as evaluated with a paired samples   t  -test. Third, in order to investigate whether the effects would change by modeling additional events of no interest we defined a model where three additional regressors of no interest were included: the probe events, the scale events and the feedback events for all learning blocks (see  ). A   t  -contrast (block 4 > 1) was defined at the first level, and evaluated at the second level in a one-sample   t  -test. Note that both models in all other aspects were identical to the primary model. 

The statistical threshold was set to   p   ≤ 0.05 (FDR corrected) at the voxel level and   k   > 0 at the cluster level for the whole brain analyses. 


####  Post hoc   Analyses 
  
Next, a set of   post hoc   tests were performed to further characterize the activation pattern observed in the primary analysis where the activation map identified in the former step was used as mask to define our regions of interests (i.e., ventral precuneus, the vmPFC, and the MTL if activity increases, and ventral precuneus if activity was reduced). 

First, block-wise comparisons were performed to test activity changes between each block (based on death-bug judgment task events >all dot-bug judgment task events), with paired-samples   t  -tests. 

Second, to explicitly test whether there was a link between activity levels in the ventral precuneus and retrieval success (RMSE of old items at the final test, see items denoted T in  ), beta values extracted from the fourth learning block (5 mm radius around the peak voxel) was correlated with RMSE of training items at the final test. 

Third, in two parametric analyses we tested for gradual changes between each judgment event (i.e., increases and reductions of the BOLD signal) that might be missed when averaging activity within blocks. The purpose of this approach was related to that repeated judgment continuously improve learning, such that more learning lead to better memory representations that can be retrieved for similarity comparison. First, exponential and linear adaption of the BOLD signal was evaluated separately, and the individual judgment task events (duration modeled as response time), and linear or exponential functions included as a separate regressor in the GLM (see  ). BOLD signal that was affected by the modulator (i.e., displayed a linear or exponential increase in BOLD signal between each death-bug judgment task event) and two contrasts modeling these effects were defined. The six movement parameters were included as covariates of no interest. All regressors except the head movement parameters were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Effects were evaluated with second level one sample   t  -tests. 

Statistical threshold for the post-hoc tests were set to   p   < 0.05 (Bonferroni corrected for number of regions,   p   < 0.05/4 =   p   < 0.016) and   k   > 0 at the cluster level. 


#### BOLD-Signal Differences on the Judgment Task Collapsed Over All Scanned Blocks in Relation to Model Fit 
  
Finally, it was evaluated whether ventral precuneus activity was significantly higher than baseline across all scanned blocks during death-bug judgments, and in addition if this activity was related to the fit of an EBM during the final test.   recently demonstrated that activity in the ventral precuneus, when making judgments on novel test-phase items, predicted how well an EBM fit the judgment data. To evaluate which brain regions that were overall engaged during all learning blocks, a contrast collapsing all learning blocks, subtracted against the dot-bug judgment task, was defined (All blocks – All dot-bugs). A one-sample   t  -test at the second level was used to evaluate the contrast in a whole-brain analysis. 

Finally, the activation map identified in the whole-brain analysis was again used as mask, and a one-sample   t  -test with the fit of the EBM was used as covariate of interest to test for a functional relationship between model fit and activity levels in the regions of interest that was consistently engaged during learning (ventral precuneus, vmPFC, and the bilateral MTL). Extracted beta values (5 mm radius around the peak voxel) was correlated with RMSD of the EBM on final judgment test-phase data. 




## Results 
  
### Behavioral Results 
  
#### Quantitative Model Fit 
  
With regard to the diagnostic comparison of model fit during the final test phase, the paired samples   t  -test did importantly confirm that EBM fit participants data better than CAM,   t   (26) = −11.21,   p   < 0.001 (see  ). However, one participant’s judgment data was found to have better model fit of CAM than EBM at the final test, and was therefore excluded from the imaging analyses. 

The model fit during the four intermediate tests revealed that participants adhered increasingly to an exemplar-based strategy over the course of the four scanned learning blocks (see  ): a repeated measurements ANOVA with model fit (RMSD of EBM and CAM, respectively) and the four intermediate tests (1- 4) was performed. The ANOVA yielded a main effect of model [  F   = 100.91;   MSE   = 3.69;   p   < 0.001,   = 0.79], and intermediate tests [  F   = 8.97;   MSE   = 8.46;   p   < 0.001,   = 0.26]. There was no significant interaction between model and intermediate test [  F   = 2.36;   MSE   = 3.16;   p   = 0.094,   = 0.83]. In sum, despite the fact that model fit of both models improved as a function of block, fit of the EBM was considerably better than the fit of CAM during all blocks (e.g., the fit of EBM was more than twice as good as the fit of CAM during the fourth intermediate test). 


#### Performance During Learning 
  
Performance (RMSE) as a function of blocks is shown in  . Already during the first four blocks of learning (i.e., the blocks that were scanned) performance was drastically improved. A repeated measurements ANOVA on RMSE as a function of the first four blocks (1–4) was performed, reflecting performance during the fMRI judgment session. The ANOVA yielded a main effect of block [  F   = 99.67;   MSE   = 1.48;   p   < 0.001; = 0.79]. Paired samples   t  -tests moreover confirmed significant improvements between each of the first four blocks (all   ps   < 0.05). On average, participants reached the learning criterion (≤1.5 RMSE) after seven blocks (  M   = 7.4;   SD   = 3.03). 


#### Performance During the Final Test 
  
A paired samples   t  -test on RMSE demonstrated that participants were better at judging training exemplars compared to new exemplars in the final test phase,   M   = 1.31,   SD   = 1.1,   M   = 6.8,   SD   = 1.95  , t  (26) = −13.3  , p   < 0.001, a typical pattern predicted by EBMs (e.g.,  ,  ). This result hold even when excluding the most extreme extrapolation items with cue values (−1, −1, −1, −1) and (1, 1, 1, 1),   M   = 1.31,   SD   = 1.1,   M     = 2.2,   SD   = 1.31  , t  (26) = −2.48  , p   = 0.02. 

On average, the   EI   based on judgments of the most extreme novel test items was negative and the confidence interval did not include zero [  M   = −3.84; 95% CI (−4.9, −2.79);   SD   = 2.67], demonstrating that participants were poor at extrapolating outside the acquired learning range. Again, this is a typical pattern predicted by EBMs (e.g.,  ,  ). 

Taken together, the behavioral results suggest that participants overall learnt to master the task with an exemplar-based judgment strategy rather than adopting a rule-based judgment strategy. 



### Imaging Results 
  
#### Changes in BOLD Signal Between Early and Late Learning Blocks 
  
If a similarity-based process in the ventral precuneus is key for human judgment, activity changes in the ventral precuneus was expected when learning to master a judgment task. The whole-brain analysis revealed changes between early and late learning (  p   < 0.05, FDR). The contrast (block 4 > 1) yielded effects in a number of large clusters that were more engaged during late learning than early learning (see   for localizations). Of most importance, we observed higher BOLD signal late compared to early learning in the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC, and the bilateral MTL. A number of other regions typically implicated in episodic memory retrieval was also identified, including the temporal pole and insula (see   and   for localizations).

(C)   Display a correlation between activity drawn from block four in the ventral precuneus, and performance reported in RMSE of training items at the final test. The   p   < 0.05,   p   < 0.01, and   p   < 0.001. 
  
Paired sample post-hoc   t  -tests on block-related differences inside the mask revealed that there was a significant reduction in BOLD signal between the first and the second learning block in the vmPFC and the left MTL (all   p’s   < 0.05). Significant increases in the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC, and the bilateral MTL were observed between the second and the third block and the first and the fourth block (all   p‘s   < 0.05; see  ). 

In support of the findings from the primary statistical model, all three control analyses yielded overlapping results. First, when contrasting the death-bug judgment task with the dot-bug judgment task, the group-level comparison [i.e., (block 4 – dot-bugs) vs. (block 1 – dot-bugs)] revealed an overlapping activation pattern, albeit under a less conservative statistical threshold (see  ). Importantly, the pattern included BOLD signal differences in the ventral precuneus (  x, y, z   = −4, −54, 22;   t   = 3.05), the vmPFC (  x, y, z   = 6, 52, 10;   t   = 5.08), and the bilateral MTL (  x, y, z   = −26, −10, −28  ; t   = 3.12  ; x, y, z   = 32, −8, −28;   t   = 2.69). Second, the difference in BOLD activity between blocks 1 and 4 [defined by (Task4 – Rest) – (Task 1 – Rest)] was calculated for the death-bug judgment task and the dot-bug judgment task, respectively. The observed patterns in the regions of interest (ventral precuneus, vmPFC, and MTL) strongly suggested that the learning-related changes between block 1 and 4 were selective (or considerably stronger) in the death-bug judgment task than in the dot-bug judgment task (see  ). Third, including additional regressors in the model yielded virtually identical results as in the primary model, again including the ventral precuneus (  x, y, z   = 8, −52, 22  ; t   = 5.03). 

Reversing the contrast (block 1 > 4) yielded marked BOLD signal differences in one large cluster, including frontoparietal regions and the basal ganglia, distributed over both hemispheres, with the strongest peak in the visual cortex (see  ). Similar activation patterns have previously been observed in frontoparietal networks related to executive demands and cognitive control (see e.g.,  ). Thus, it is plausible to observe reductions in such regions as a function of learning to master a task. No reduction of the BOLD signal in the ventral precuneus was observed under the chosen statistical threshold (see   for localizations).

#### Correlational Analysis Revealed a Link Between BOLD Signal in Ventral Precuneus and Performance on Training Items at the Final Test 
  
As a next step, we investigated if a link between BOLD level activity in the ventral precuneus could be linked to the process of building memory representations. Correlating activity in ventral precuneus during the last scanned learning block (i.e., block 4) with performance on training items (RMSE) at the final test revealed a strong negative correlation [  r   (24) = −0.46,   p   = 0.019], suggesting that the higher the activity level in the ventral precuneus toward the end of learning, the better performance on those same training items during the final judgment test phase (see  ). 


#### Parametric Analyses Confirmed Gradual Increase of the BOLD Signal in the Ventral Precuneus 
  
The parametric method offered further insights into whether the BOLD signal gradually changed between each judgment event. First, parametric   increase   of the BOLD signal was evaluated inside the mask (block 4 > 1). Linear increase of the BOLD signal was observed in the ventral precuneus (  x, y, z   = 2, −62, 22;   t   = 3.89;   p   = 0.0003). Exponential increase of the BOLD signal was also identified in the ventral precuneus (  x, y, z   = 0, −64, 16;   t   = 2.80;   p   = 0.002) and in the vmPFC (  x, y, z   = −14, 74, 14;   t   = 3.35;   p   = 0.0012). No gradual changes were observed in the MTL under the chosen statistical threshold. 

Parametric   reductions   were also evaluated using the activation map from the contrast (block 1 > 4) as mask. Linear reductions of the BOLD signal were observed, with the strongest peak in the left striatum including the head and body of the caudate (  x, y, z   = −20, 16, 8;   t   = 5.54;   p   < 0.001. The exponential parametric analysis also displayed a similar effect, with the strongest peak in the left putamen (  x, y, z   = −4, 4, −4;   t   = 4.22;   p   < 0.001) whereas no parametric reductions were observed in the ventral precuneus, the MTL or the vmPFC under the chosen statistical threshold. 


#### A Link Between Exemplar-Based Model Fit and BOLD Signal in Ventral Precuneus During Judgment Learning 
  
The whole-brain analysis collapsing all learning blocks against the perceptual baseline task (All blocks – Dot bugs) demonstrated effects in a large cluster covering both hemispheres, including prefrontal, temporal, and parietal regions. Notably, the strongest peak was located in the ventral precuneus in close proximity to the peak identified in   and the cluster completely overlapped with the cluster identified in the contrast block 4 > 1 reported above (see  ,  ). 
  
Overall BOLD-signal during learning. 
    
In terms of a functional relationship between BOLD activity and model fit of the EBM during the final test, the results revealed negative correlations between BOLD level activity that was consistently engaged during learning and model fit of the EBM in the ventral precuneus [  x, y, z   = 12, −52, 10;   r   (24) = −0.52;   p   = 0.007] and also in the vmPFC [  x, y, z   = −18, 34, −12;   r   (24) = −0.46;   p   = 0.17] but not in the MTL. 




## Discussion 
  
Exemplar-based processes, as captured by EBMs, are important for adaptive human judgment, decision making, and categorization. The ventral precuneus was recently identified as a key brain region for human multiple-cue judgment and brain activity in this region could be linked to how well an EBM fit novel test-phase data ( ). However, further research was needed in order to establish whether the role for this region in exemplar-based judgment processes was related to episodic memory, or rather to visual attention. In the present study we aimed to tackle this question by focusing on changes in BOLD signal over learning in a task where participants were learning to make judgments with an exemplar-based strategy while being scanned with fMRI. Participant’s judgment data at the final test was in line with behavioral predictions of an EBM. In addition, while minor decreases in RMSD as a function of learning is likely to partly reflect reduced measurement error related to the quality of the data as learning progressed, model fit of the four intermediate tests suggested that participants adhered increasingly to an exemplar-based strategy over the course of the four scanned learning blocks. This behavioral outcome was preceded by increased engagement of a large-scale network of brain regions previously demonstrated to be important for episodic memory processes, including the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC and the MTL (see e.g.,  ;  ;  ). Activity levels in the ventral precuneus predicted performance after learning. Moreover, brain activity in ventral precuneus was significantly higher than the perceptual baseline task even when collapsing across all learning blocks. 

Neural correlates traditionally expected during episodic memory processes are frequently reported also in research on human judgment, decision making, and categorization ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). For example, the MTL and the vmPFC have been found to be engaged during concept generalization ( ), and the MTL has been linked to similarity-based processes in categorization (see e.g.,  ;  ). The vmPFC has been implicated in response selection (for a review see  ), value comparison, and confidence (e.g.,  ) processes that are important for adaptive decision making. The ventral precuneus has also been reported in tasks expected to pose demands on episodic memory processes, for example when making judgments based on a recognition heuristic ( ), and when categorizing stimuli based on similarity ( ). Moreover, two studies on similarity-based categorization using quantitative measures of EBMs reported ventral precuneus in activation tables, in a task expected to pose demands on episodic memory (e.g.,  ;  ). However, this is to our knowledge the first study that specifically target the potential role for the ventral precuneus in exemplar-based judgment processes. 

How could the link between ventral precuneus and exemplar-based processes be understood? The ventral precuneus, together with the vmPFC and the MTL, has been linked to a network that enables episodic memory retrieval (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). It has been suggested that the ventral precuneus could act as a gateway between MTL and other cortical regions involved in episodic memory processes ( ). The ventral precuneus could also be involved either in directing attention toward internal memory representations stored in the MTL, or in selection and retrieval of memory representations used for decision making (see  ). The precuneus was recently found to be a critical cortical node for coordinating MTL-cortical communication, and stimulation to this region altered memory vividness and ease of recall ( ). Notably, the present study demonstrated that activity levels in the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC and the bilateral MTL increased between early and late learning blocks. Moreover, activity levels in the ventral precuneus toward the end of the learning phase was functionally related to performance at test, demonstrating a typical effect related to retrieval success (see e.g.,  ). Based on the present results, one possibility is that the ventral precuneus is involved in building and retrieving memory representations with the MTL and the vmPFC. Repetition yielded a stronger and more accessible memory representation that could be retrieved for exemplar-based judgment. The parametric increase in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC, and the link between BOLD activity in the ventral precuneus and performance at the final test, could thus demonstrate a process of aiding retrieval, and response selection of stronger memory representations between trials. For example, exemplar-based processes in the vmPFC corroborates well recent findings linking this region to the level of evidence for similarity-based category decisions ( ;  ). The ventral precuneus was consistently engaged during learning, and activity levels in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC predicted EBM fit at the final test. This interpretation also connects the present findings to research on categorization focusing on the role of the MTL in building memory representations retrieved for similarity comparison (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). 

It should be noted that the reduction of the BOLD signal between the first and the second learning block suggest that this process might not have been equally engaged during the entire fMRI judgment learning phase. Human judgment and decision making are known to be adaptive, with suggested contingent strategy shifts based on the content of the task (see e.g.,  ,  ;  ;  ;  ; but see also  ;  ). One speculative interpretation of the specific reduction between block one and two could be that participants engaged in a different judgment strategy during the second learning block in order to establish the best strategy to solve the judgment task. However, it should also be noted that the parametric increase in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC observed from trial to trial suggest that the process of building memory representations needed for exemplar-based judgment might continue at some level, irrespective of eventual strategy shifts. 

In contrast to the robust increase between early and late learning blocks, reductions in activity in brain regions typically implied in a frontoparietal control system were observed between early and late learning (see e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ). Related effects have been observed following extensive practice, and when people learn to cope with novel demands in an effortful task (e.g.,  ;  ). Importantly, we did not observe reduced activation in ventral precuneus as a function of learning under the chosen statistical threshold. The present results thus do not provide evidence for that the key role for ventral precuneus in multiple-cue judgment is related to demanding visuo-spatial attention processes that can be expected to be less demanding over time (see e.g.,  ;  ). It should be noted that one alternative interpretation of the present results could be that the task simply became easier with practice. If so, reduced activation in fronto-parietal regions, and engagement of the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC and the MTL could be a consequence of reduced effort. For example, nodes involved in attention and working memory demanding tasks are anticorrelated with deactivation in several brain regions during such processes, including default mode activation in the medial parietal cortex, the vmPFC, and the MTL ( ). However, increased activity-levels in the MTL and the ventral precuneus over learning is well-established signatures for episodic learning (e.g.,  ). It has also been shown that gradual increases in the precuneus might be diagnostic for rapid creation of memory representations because this predicts successful behavior ( ). Thus, we find it more likely that the observed effect is not a mere consequence of effort, but rather reflects gradual accumulation of stored exemplar representations that guide behavior. 

We did not have   a priori   predictions for all brain regions that exhibited changes over learning. Our choice to focus on the ventral precuneus, the vmPFC, and the MTL was based on the well-known relationship between activity levels in these regions and episodic memory processes (for reviews see e.g.,  ;  ;  ). Nevertheless, future research could aim to specify how other brain regions reported in the present study are related to exemplar-based judgment learning to test the validity of our findings. Regions that could be of particular interest for future research on exemplar-based processes for human judgment is the insular cortex and the temporal pole. For example, the insular cortex has been suggested to be a hub for large-scale brain networks (for a review see  ) and decision making, for example in action selection based on different alternatives (for a review see  ). The insula could in a similar manner support exemplar-based processes for human multiple-cue judgment, by its potential involvement in selection of exemplars used for similarity comparison. The temporal pole is believed to play an important role for memory retrieval of specific memory representations (see e.g.,  ;  ;  ) and has been suggested to be an amodal hub that integrates information that is associated with a concept ( ). 

Recently, a large-scale behavioral study where participants made multiple-cue judgments either with rule-based or exemplar-based strategies demonstrated that rule-based and exemplar-based processes draw on different cognitive resources, related to working memory and episodic memory, respectively ( ). The present results thus concur with the conclusions by   and further provide neurocognitive data informative for the link between exemplar-based judgment learning and episodic memory processes. 

How do our results compare to detailed neurocognitive models of category learning? One of the most prominent models is the model COVIS (Competition between Verbal and Implicit Systems) suggesting that two competing neural systems underlie human categorization ( ). COVIS detail that rule-based processes are governed by the prefrontal cortex, and that implicit processes instead rely on the body and tail of the caudate. Recently, it was proposed that exemplar theory should be included in the procedural system of COVIS, where the caudate is linked to mediation of synaptic connections between the striatum and other cortical regions related to experience of the task at hand ( ). Whereas some previous research in line with COVIS have identified gradual increase in the caudate ( ; but see also  ;  ), the present results rather demonstrated reductions in the caudate, both between blocks and parametrically between trials. One interpretation of the present results is that EBMs capture an episodic memory process governed by the ventral precuneus, the MTL and the vmPFC. However, it is possible that EBM fit in procedural learning tasks (e.g., information integration tasks) might correlate more with regions involved in procedural learning, such as the caudate. Exemplar-based processes could in that respect engage different neurocognitive processes depending on the content of the task, which sometimes might require episodic memory, and other times implicit memory. Future studies should be devoted to investigate the link between the caudate, human judgment and the EBMs‘ predictions to further clarify this topic. 

### Limitations and Future Directions 
  
One assumption in categorization ( ) and judgment ( ) is that people often try to identify relationships between cue and criterion when facing a novel task, a so-called rule-bias (e.g.,  ;  ). However, the modeling results in the present study did not give support for a rule-bias; an EBM fit test-phase data better than a rule-based model on all intermediate tests. This result could imply that participants did not engage in initial hypothesis testing, but rather memorized exemplars immediately, supported also with the parametric increase in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC. Similarity-based processes have been shown to be hard to resist ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and has been argued to be an unavoidable consequence of attending a stimulus in instance learning ( ) which might suggest that an exemplar-based strategy was consistently used. Alternatively, the model fit measure used here is rather coarse, and fine-grained behavioral differences connected to a potential rule-bias within a learning block might have been missed. The observed reduction between the first and the second learning block might for example reflect a dynamic strategy shift related to a rule-bias that was not picked up with intermediate test-phase data. It should however, be stressed that the purpose of the present study was not to focus on dynamic strategy shifts during judgment learning. Further research could implement and test learning models of the assumed processes and relate measures from such models to fMRI data to gain more detailed information related to this question (see e.g.,  ,  ;  ). 

One limitation of the present study is that it was not practically possible to scan the entire learning session, due to the fact that each trial in a multiple-cue judgment task require rather long events. Nevertheless, as was evident in the behavioral data, a large proportion of learning occurred during the first four learning blocks. 

The dot-bug judgment task was included in the experiment to be able to control for sensory-motor activity related to inspecting the visual stimuli and conducting a response. This control task included a limited number of events (a total of 20 events, i.e., 5 per section of the experiment, block 1 – 4). The reasons for including fewer events in the dot-bug judgment task were (i) that the experiment was quite long, and (ii) no learning-related changes for the dot-bug judgment task with unique (not re-presented) items were expected. Still, ideally, the experiment should have included the same number of events (80) in both the death- and dot-bug judgment task. We note this as a limitation of the design, but highlight that the results pattern when the dot-bug events from blocks 1 and 4 were subtracted from the death-bug events indicated that learning-related changes were selective (or considerably stronger) in the death-bug judgment task. 

Finally, the main purpose of the present study was to investigate how a similarity-based process in the ventral precuneus, critically suggested to be a key region for similarity-based and rule-based processes in human judgment (see  ) should be understood. The present results suggest that the ventral precuneus is involved in a mnemonic process of building and retrieving memory representations used for similarity comparison in a task designed to capture exemplar-based processes specifically. The extent to which the ventral precuneus contribute to the same cognitive component process in rule-based judgment is unclear. The present results could guide future research to test whether an exemplar-based process in the ventral precuneus is involved also during rule-based judgment learning. 



## Conclusion 
  
We investigated how the ventral precuneus contribute to exemplar-based processes in human judgment. Focusing on differences in the BOLD signal between early and late learning during similarity-based judgment learning, we investigated implications for this region in mnemonic representational processes. The results showed an increase of the BOLD signal in a parietal memory network related to retrieval success, including the ventral precuneus. Moreover, activity in the ventral precuneus toward the end of learning predicted retrieval success after learning. Thus, our findings indicate that activity levels in the ventral precuneus reflect gradual accumulation of exemplars in memory that could guide behavior, presumably by building memory representations for exemplar-based judgments.

# Abstract
 
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan with tracer [ F]-fluorodeoxy-glucose ( F-FDG) is widely used to measure the glucose metabolism in neurodegenerative disease such as Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD). Previous studies using  F-FDG PET mainly focused on the motor or non-motor symptoms but not the severity of IPD. In this study, we aimed to determine the metabolic patterns of  F-FDG in different stages of IPD defined by Hoehn and Yahr rating scale (H-Y rating scale) and to identify regions in the brain that play critical roles in disease progression. Fifty IPD patients were included in this study. They were 29 men and 21 women (mean±SD, age 57.7±11.1 years, disease duration 4.0±3.8 years, H-Y 2.2±1.1). Twenty healthy individuals were included as normal controls. Following  F-FDG PET scan, image analysis was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST). The metabolic feature of IPD and regions-of-interests (ROIs) were determined. Correlation analysis between ROIs and H-Y stage was performed. SPM analysis demonstrated a significant hypometabolic activity in bilateral putamen, caudate and anterior cingulate as well as left parietal lobe, prefrontal cortex in IPD patients. In contrast, hypermetabolism was observed in the cerebellum and vermis. There was a negative correlation (  p  =0.007,   r  =-0.412) between H-Y stage and caudate metabolic activity. Moreover, the prefrontal area also showed a negative correlation with H-Y (  P  =0.033,   r  =-0.334). Thus, the uptake of FDG in caudate and prefrontal cortex can potentially be used as a surrogate marker to evaluate the severity of IPD. 
 

# Body
 
Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD) is a age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the asymmetrical loss of melanin-containing dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra [ ]. Neuronal death often occurs years before the time of symptom onset in IPD. By the time a patient presents with clinical symptoms, approximately 75% of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) were lost [ ]. Tracer based method to study dopamine receptor such as  C- CFT is not sensitive to predict the severity of IPD [ ]. The detection of Lewy body in brainstem (within the SN) or within the cortex can confirm the diagnosis of IPD but this method is not convenient, and it needs an invasive biopsy. Currently, the diagnosis of IPD mostly depends on the presence of motor symptoms such as rest tremor, rigidity and freezing of gait, which lacks objectivity, especially in early stages of IPD as the clinical symptoms often overlap with several ‘look-alike’ disorders [ - ]. To date, the availability of quantitative biomarkers to assess the progression of the disease objectively is limited. PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a hybrid in-vivo imaging technique that can track the brain pathophysiological activities in a noninvasive way in various neurological and psychiatric disorders [ ,  ]. The [18F]-fluorodeoxy-glucose ( F-FDG) PET assessing brain metabolism has demonstrated its utility in metabolic disorders including IPD [ ]. 

Previous studies using FDG PET to analyze IPD patients mainly focused on the motor and no-motor symptoms such as cognitive, fatigue and anxiety[ - ], not the severity of disease. In addition, insights upon the progression of IPD and compensatory alterations in other parts of brain during disease progression are still lacking. Accurate and comprehensive description of the natural course and pathophysiological activity is pivotal to the assessment IPD as disease progresses.  F-FDG PET metabolic imaging analysis can measure pathological activity and has been widely used in IPD. It can be potentially used as an objective, quantifiable and stable biomarker for the diagnosis of IPD as well as the evaluation of disease progression and the response to treatment [ ,  ]. 

In this study, we evaluated the metabolic pattern of  F-FDG using PET scan in 50 IPD patients and analyzed the relationship between metabolic activity of regions of interest (ROI) and H-Y stages. We identified the regions that were associated with disease progression. 

## MATERIALS AND METHODS 
  
### Subjects 
  
From March 2016 to November 2016, 55 IPD patients were recruited consecutively from the Department of Neurology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. All patients were fulfilled the diagnostic criteria proposed by the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank. All had disease stages clinically defined as "" medication off "" state by Hoehn and Yahr’s (H&Y) rating scale and no patients had any occupying lesions in central nervous system. Among these 55 patients, 3 had progressive supranuclear palsy and 2 had severe brain atrophy; these 5 patients were excluded in this study. In total, 50 IPD patients were included for data analysis. We also recruited 20 age-matched healthy controls (11 men and 9 women, mean ± SD, 54.6 ± 12.3 years) for comparison. They showed normal neurological examination results and had no history of any central nervous system diseases. All participants provided written informed consent. 


### PET Image Acquisition 
  
Ethical permission was obtained from Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University. All patients and healthy controls underwent brain  F-FDG PET imaging examination. Individuals fasted for at least 6 hours before  F-FDG injection and stopped taking any drugs (including oral antiparkinson medications) that could affect brain metabolism for at least 3 days prior to the scanning. The  F-FDG (37 MBq/kg) was injected intravenously in awake and resting state. PET image acquisition was started 60 minutes after the injection. The PET studies were performed using a Discovery ST, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA. Computed attenuation correction was utilized to correct the brain images for attenuation of 511-keV photons. Emission images were reconstructed in a 192 ×192 × 47 matrix with a pixel size of 1.56 ×1.56 × 3.27 in the axial direction using the ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm, with 5 iterations and 32 subsets. Images were then corrected for attenuation using the CT transmission scan. Heart rate, blood pressure and pulse oximetry were measured during the PET procedure. 


### F-FDG PET Analysis 
  
Visual Evaluation of PET Data: Brain F-FDG PET images were visually evaluated by 3 experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Brain areas with decreased and increased metabolic activity were identified and reported after at least 2 readers reached a consensus. 

SPM analysis: All images were converted from DICOM to NIFTI using MRIcon (University of South Carolina, USA). Images were then analyzed voxel-by-voxel using SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University College, London, UK) running on Matlab (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA). Firstly, PET images were spatially normalized into a common Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) atlas anatomical space, followed by a 12-parameter affine transformation and non-linear transformation. Secondly, 2×2×2mm voxels were constructed. Normalized images were smoothed with FWHM=12mm and Isotropic Gaussian Kernel to increase the signal to noise ratio. Preprocessed PET image values were corrected to a mean value of 50 mL/dL/min by “proportional scaling” to reduce individual variation. A mask with 0.8 intensity value was used to select voxels activity and to exclude extra cranial activities. A two-sample t-test was applied between diseased and control groups. To reduce the impact of age and gender, both factors were regressed out as covariates. The P value and extended voxel size (k) were thresholded at two levels and three levels, respectively:   p  < 0.001(matched with k > 50, 100, 200 voxels corrected, respectively) and   p   < 0.01 (matched with k > 50, 100, 200 voxels corrected, respectively). In addition, we chose the smaller   p   value first since   p   value wasn’t correct with false discovery rate (FDR) or Familywise error rate (FWE), but the central hypometabolic regions had been kept unchanged among at least two voxel sizes simultaneously as described in our previous study [ ]. 

The significant clusters were tested to see whether they were closely related to clinical characters. Then the ROIs were automatically delineated with REST ( ) on MNI atlas anatomical space with parametric PET images. Brain regions that showed   p   < 0.001 at voxel level were considered significant and were computed and transformed into z-scores. Accordingly, a subsequent correlation analysis between the metabolic activity of ROIs and H-Y rating scale was conducted using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). 
  
Clinical and Demographic characteristics of 50 patients (29 men; 21 women) and 20 health control (13 men; 7 women). 
    


## RESULTS 
  
### Patient information 
  
There were 50 IPD patients in total (29 men and 21 women, mean±SD, age 57.7±11.1 years, disease duration 4.0±3.8 years, Hoehn and Yahr Stage 2.2±1.1). Among them, 18 patients were diagnosed as H&Y stage I, 15 patient stage II, 12 patient stage III, 2 patient stage IV and 3 patient stage V ( ). In terms of therapy, 41 patients had received levodopa treatment after diagnosis and the remaining 9 patients did not receive medical intervention. All clinical information was listed in  . Twenty age-matched healthy individuals (13 men and 7 women, mean ± SD, age 55.6 ± 12.3 years) were recruited as controls. 


### Demographic characteristics 
  
Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U-test were performed respectively for gender and age comparison between IPD patients and healthy controls. There was no significant difference between the demographic data of the two groups, including gender (  p   = 0.292) and age (  p   = 0.21). 


### PET results and statistical Analysis 
  
By visual analysis, 90% (45/50) IPD patients appeared normal on FDG PET, and only 10% (5/50) showed abnormal metabolic activity and 3 of them had severe IPD in stage IV and V. 

Next, we performed SPM analysis. The difference between the IPD patients and the age-matched controls was calculated using the extent threshold 100 voxel-level with   p  <0.001,   P   <0.05. As shown in  , SPM analysis demonstrated that IPD patients had a significantly decreased metabolic activity in the areas of bilateral putamen, caudate and anterior cingulate when compared to heathy controls. Bilateral parietal lobes, temporal lobe and prefrontal area also showed decreased metabolic activity in IPD patients. In contrast, relative hypermetabolic activity was observed in the cerebellum and vermis in IPD patients ( ). 

To investigate the relationship between metabolic activity in significant clusters and H-Y stages, we measured the absolute glucose metabolic values in these regions and performed a correlation analysis between their metabolic activity and H-Y stages. As shown in  , caudate (A) and prefrontal (B) metabolic activity showed a negative correlation with H-Y stage, whereas no correlation was found in vermis (C), angular (D), occipital (E) and temporal lobes (F). 

We also studied the relationship between disease duration and stages. H-Y stages and disease duration had a moderate positive correlation (  p   =0.001, r=0.657) and a positive linear correlation between H-Y and UPDRS III scores was identified (  p   =0.001, r=0.75).

## DISCUSSION 
  
Molecular imaging analysis especially using  F-FDG is a popular tool for the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of IPD. In this study we explored the metabolic activity of different brain areas in IPD patients using  F-FDG PET. We demonstrated that SPM is an effective tool to analyze the data and showed that the metabolic activity of caudate and prefrontal cortex negatively correlated with the severity of disease in IPD patients. 

The metabolic patterns of FDG in IPD patients have been studied but results have been inconsistent in terms of the affected areas as well as the precise distribution and the trend (i.e., increases or decreases) of metabolic changes. Eidelberg previously used PD-related pattern (PDRP) and identified increased metabolic activity in pallido-thalamic and pontine, and decreased activity in supplementary motor area (SMA), parietal association, and areas of premotor cortex [ ]. The increased regions of PDRP such as the putamen and thalamus had a linear relationship with patients’ standardized motor ratings [ - ]. PD-related cognitive pattern (PDCP) was related to memory and executive function in IPD patients. It was characterized by a metabolic decrease in the medial frontal and parietal associated regions as well as a relative metabolic increase in the cerebellar vermis [ ]. Other studies showed a symmetric/asymmetric hypometabolic activity in the prefrontal, lateral frontal cortices, middle temporal gyrus, bilateral parietal association cortices, and bilateral occipital cortices, as well as a relative hypermetabolic activity in the vermis and cerebellum [ ,  ]. In addition, Strafella et al. found that IPD patients often showed asymmetric involvement of dopaminergic neurons in striatum [ ]. 

   The relationship between the metabolic activity of ROIs and H-Y stages  
A) In caudate, the metabolic activity decreased as H-Y stages increased (  p  =0.004 r=-0.441). B) Similar to caudate, prefrontal metabolic activity also decreased as H-Y stages increased (  p  =0.004 r=-0.441). C, D, E and F, show no correlation in vermis (C), angular (D), occipital (E) and temporal lobes (F). The Pearson correlation analysis was performed using SPSS software. 
  

In this study we found that IPD patients had reduced uptake in bilateral putamen, caudate, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex and increased uptake in vermis and cerebellum when compared to healthy controls. This is similar to the finding reported previously [ ]. More interestingly, we found that there was a negative relationship between H-Y rating scale and caudate metabolic activity; the higher the H-Y scale, the lower rate of caudate metabolism. The implication of this finding is twofold: first, the measurement of caudate metabolic activity can potentially offer valuable clues for early diagnosis of IPD and monitoring disease progression; second, caudate may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IPD. Future studies to explore the role of caudate in IPD will shed light on the mechanism of disease development and progression. Of note, the potential role of caudate in IPD has been indicated in previous studies [ - ]. Autopsy study demonstrated an uneven pattern of dopamine loss in the caudate nucleus in IPD patients and previous studies showed caudate hypofunction was specific in the executive domain and related to injured nigrostriatal dopaminergic function [ ,  ]. Ko et al found that the increased uptake of caudate was correlated with motor symptom severity [ ]. Evidences from in vivo PET also connected caudate dopamine depletion and executive deficits in PD patients [ ,  ,  ]. 
  
MNI coordinate of significant clusters. 
    
Another finding in our study is that prefrontal metabolic activity decreased as the disease progressed ( ,   p  =0.033,   r  =-0.334). Prefrontal cortex receives input from anterior cingulate area, a major locus of dopaminergic input to the cerebral cortex [ ]. Previous study showed that cognitive decline and behavioral abnormalities were associated with functional deficits in prefrontal cortex and striatum. After deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, the  F-FDG activity in frontal lobe and the cognitive outcome showed a linear relationship. These indicated a potential relationship between striatum and frontal cortex [ ,  ]. Evidences from human and monkey studies showed that caudate deficit may be related to the impaired frontal tasks [ ]. In our study, both the caudate and prefrontal cortex showed a correlation to the disease severity. This indicates there may be an association between cortical and subcortical changes during IPD disease progression. 

Future studies will aim to recruit more patients at stages IV and V as the majority of patients in the current study were stages I-III. Cognitive data will be collected in future studies. Other PET tracers, such as ¹¹C, H O will be used to determine the pattern and compare to  F-FDG used in this study. Finally, a longer follow-up with changes in PET pattern will be performed for the current patient group to determine the dynamic changes in IPD. 

In summary, a voxel-by-voxel based statistical mapping method, i.e. SPM12 analysis by PET scan, is a valuable tool for evaluation of disease progression in IPD. The uptake of FDG in caudate and prefrontal cortex is associated with different stages of IPD, serving as a valuable biomarker to estimate the severity of IPD.

# Abstract
 
A large literature in social neuroscience has associated the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) with the processing of self-related information. However, only recently have social neuroscience studies begun to consider the large behavioral literature showing a strong self-positivity bias, and these studies have mostly focused on its correlates during self-related judgments and decision-making. We carried out a functional MRI (fMRI) study to ask whether the mPFC would show effects of the self-positivity bias in a paradigm that probed participants’ self-concept without any requirement of explicit self-judgment. We presented social vignettes that were either self-relevant or non-self-relevant with a neutral, positive or negative outcome described in the second sentence. In previous work using event-related potentials, this paradigm has shown evidence of a self-positivity bias that influences early stages of semantically processing incoming stimuli. In the present fMRI study, we found evidence for this bias within the mPFC: an interaction between self-relevance and valence, with only positive scenarios showing a self   vs   other effect within the mPFC. We suggest that the mPFC may play a role in maintaining a positively biased self-concept and discuss the implications of these findings for the social neuroscience of the self and the role of the mPFC.

## Introduction 
  
The relationship between emotion and the self-concept lies at the core of human well-being. Understanding this complex relationship is critical for understanding motivation, learning and decision-making ( ;  ;  ) in both healthy individuals and in neuropsychiatric disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ). It is therefore important that we study the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which the self-concept and self-esteem are constructed and maintained. Here we report a functional MRI (fMRI) study examining the interaction between emotional valence and self-relevance in processing within a region that is classically associated with the self: the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). 

### The self-positivity bias 
  
It is well established that people tend to view themselves in an unrealistically positive light when compared to others or objective standards. We see ourselves as having more positive (and fewer negative) traits and abilities than others, and we expect more positive outcomes for ourselves across many domains ( ;  ;  ;  ). We are able to maintain these positive self-evaluations via motivated reasoning and asymmetric treatment of positive and negative self-related information. In response to negative information about ourselves, we employ a variety of strategies such as reinterpreting outcomes, shifting standards of comparison, and attributing negative outcomes to external, situation-specific factors ( ;  ). The result is that beliefs are more likely to be updated in response to positive than negative information about ourselves ( ). 

This ‘self-positivity bias’ has important real-world consequences. Positive self-views are often seen as key for self-esteem and motivation ( ;  ), and lack of a self-positivity bias is associated with mood disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ). In addition, modeling work suggests that, under many circumstances, unrealistically positive views about the self can lead to adaptive behavior ( ). On the other hand, there can be negative consequences of such positive illusions. These include a failure to adjust behavior in response to knowledge of disease risk factors and inadequate studying by students who have an unrealistic perception of their own knowledge ( ;  ). It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms underlying unrealistic self-positivity effects ( ;  ). 


### Approaches to examining the self-positivity bias in the brain 
  
One way in which researchers have explored the neural basis of the self-positivity bias is to examine brain activity as participants carry out the types of decision-making tasks that are typically used to show self-positivity effects. For example, in a commonly used task, participants explicitly compare themselves to an average peer on various traits. The key finding is that well over half the participants rate themselves above average on positive traits or below average on negative traits, which is of course statistically impossible ( ). In a series of fMRI studies, Beer and colleagues reported that the degree to which participants showed the self-positivity bias (e.g. rated themselves above average or claimed knowledge they did not have) was associated with activity within the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC;  ;  ;  ). However, the pattern of activation within this region, as well as its functional connectivity, differed depending on whether self-esteem is under threat ( ;  ). Beer and colleagues took this as evidence that behavioral self-positivity effects do not all reflect the same cognitive mechanisms; they can emerge either from simple heuristics and cognitive biases or motivated cognition, depending on the context ( ;  ). 

Understanding the neural underpinnings of decision-making processes associated with the self-positivity bias is important because it reveals the mechanisms underlying active self-enhancement. On the other hand, some theorists have argued that self-positivity effects in these kinds of tasks reflect more general cognitive biases and/or the desire to present oneself well, rather than reflecting the participant’s true self-concept ( ;  ;  ;  ; see discussion in  ). These previous studies therefore leave open the question of whether the self-positivity bias emerges purely through processes of explicit self-related decisions, or whether it is also a basic, implicit aspect of the way we view ourselves. If the latter is the case, then the bias should also influence brain regions that are classically associated with self-processing. 

A large neuroimaging literature has identified a network associated with processing self-related information. Rather than employing the kinds of social comparison decision-making tasks used to study the self-positivity bias, these studies have more directly examined contrasts between self   vs   other. These include comparisons between conditions in which participants think about themselves   vs   conditions in which they think about others, or in which they are presented with self-relevant vs. other-relevant stimuli. Such contrasts reveal activity within temporal poles, the temporal-parietal junction and much of the cortical midline ( ;  ;  ). Within this network, the region most consistently associated with self-related processing is the mPFC, usually in areas dorsal to the orbitofrontal region observed in the social comparison and judgment tasks described above ( ;  ;  ;  ).  While there is debate about the precise function of this region and the extent to which it is specialized or selective for self-related processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), its consistent activation by self-related stimuli and conditions suggests that it plays an important role in processing information about the self. It is therefore natural to ask whether self-related activity within the mPFC can be modulated by the self-positivity bias. 

Only a handful of fMRI studies have manipulated both valence and self-relevance within the same paradigm, and most of these studies have manipulated self-relevance through the task, for example, by asking participants to judge whether positive or negative trait adjectives or other stimuli are self-relevant   vs   judging whether they are relevant to someone else ( ;  ;  ;  ; see also  ;  ). Because participants are more likely to judge positive stimuli as self-relevant, this confounds self-relevance with valence. 

An alternative approach is to manipulate both the self-relevance and valence of the stimuli themselves to examine how the brain is modulated by the interaction between these two variables during the processing of these stimuli. This type of paradigm can therefore test whether the self-positivity bias is a relatively automatic aspect of how we process information about ourselves. 

In a previous fMRI study,  ) took this general approach. Participants read short positive and negative phrases that were presented either in the third person or in the first person, e.g. ‘his fear’   vs   ‘my fear’. First person context increased the effects of valence in emotion-associated regions (e.g. amygdala). The authors also reported differences between first person and third person trials in the mPFC, but this effect did not differ according to valence. However, in contrast with our own previous work (discussed below), a previous study using event-related potentials (ERPs) with the same materials also showed no effects of the self-positivity bias ( ). One reason for this may be the limited context of the two-word noun phrases used. Perhaps more importantly, it is not clear whether phrases in first person should be regarded as truly self-relevant given that participants have a lot of experience hearing and reading sentences in first person (e.g. in conversation, on social media, in novels) without interpreting them as being about themselves. Indeed, previous behavioral work has shown that second person (‘you’) is more likely than first person (‘I’) to lead people to read text as self-relevant ( ;  ; see also  ;  ). 


### The present study 
  
We have previously developed a paradigm to probe effects of the self-positivity bias on the processing of self-relevant information in the absence of self-related judgments or decisions ( ). Participants are simply asked to read and comprehend short two-sentence vignettes. Valence is varied by whether the second sentence has a neutral, positive or negative outcome (determined by a single word). Self-relevance is varied by changing the subject of the second sentence from a person’s name to ‘you’, which, as noted above, is known to lead readers to adopt a self-relevant perspective ( ;  ;  ). For example: ‘A man knocks on   Sandra’s  /  your   hotel room door.   Sandra  /  You   see(s) that he has a tray/gift/gun in his hand’. This design therefore fully crosses Valence (neutral, pleasant, unpleasant) and Self-Relevance (self, other). Because this approach gives participants no indication that their self-views are being assessed, it provides a method to examine effects of the self-positivity bias in the absence of explicit self-assessment, and avoids the confounds inherent in manipulating self-relevance via a judgment task. 

In a previous ERP study using this paradigm ( ), we examined the N400 component of the ERP, which is reduced to the extent that the semantic features of a word match predictions generated by the preceding context ( ). We showed that positive words elicited a smaller N400 in self-relevant (vs. other-relevant) contexts, while no effects of self-relevance were observed in neutral or negative scenarios. This shows that participants had stronger expectations for positive information in self-relevant scenarios, and that these expectations influenced the earliest stages of semantically processing an incoming word during comprehension. This study therefore provided evidence that the self-positivity bias is a relatively automatic aspect of the way we comprehend self-relevant information. 

In the present fMRI study, we used this paradigm to test the hypothesis that activity in the mPFC—a region that, as discussed above, has been strongly associated with self-related processing—would also show effects of the self-positivity bias. We predicted this bias would manifest as a larger effect of self-relevance for the positive scenarios than the negative or neutral scenarios; i.e. the scenarios most consistent with the positively biased self-concept would show the greatest mPFC activation. 



## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Seventeen female participants were recruited through an advertisement on a Tufts University community website ( ). Only female participants were included in order to increase power by reducing heterogeneity and increasing the effect size (exploratory analyses of our ERP data in the same paradigm and population suggested female participants showed larger main effects of the emotion manipulation). Self-reported race and ethnicity was non-Hispanic White (12), Hispanic (1), Asian (1), mixed Asian/White (2) and unreported (1). All participants were right-handed native English speakers between the ages of 18 and 23 (M = 20.7, SD = 1.3), who reported no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. Participants were paid for their participation and provided informed consent in accordance with the procedures of the Institutional Review Board of Massachusetts General Hospital. 
  
 Examples of two-sentence scenarios in each of the six conditions.   The critical word is underlined (but did not appear underlined in the actual stimulus lists). Thirty-six scenarios were followed by comprehension questions. For example, the scenario ‘Casper is/You are new on campus. His/Your classmates think he is/you are quite idiosyncratic/clever/dumb compared to others.’ was followed by the question ‘Did Casper/you go to this school last year?’ with the correct answer being ‘no’. Participants were instructed to press a button corresponding to the index finger and middle finger for yes and no respectively before the question left the screen 
    
Valence and arousal ratings of scenarios. Scenarios were rated by online participants who did not participate in the MRI study. Valence was rated on a scale of 1 (most negative) to 7 (most positive) with 4 as neutral. Arousal was rated on a scale of 1 (least arousing) to 7 (most arousing). Means are presented with standard deviations (across scenarios) in parentheses 
  

### Stimuli 
  
Stimuli were a modified version of those used in our previous ERP work ( ,  ,  ). Two hundred sixteen sets of two-sentence scenarios were developed, each with three Valence conditions (positive, neutral, and negative) and two Self-Relevance conditions (self and other) so that there were six versions for each scenario: self-positive, self-neutral, self-negative, other-positive, other-neutral and other-negative. 

Example scenarios are presented in  . All scenarios were written in the present tense. The first sentence (4–13 words long) always introduced a situation involving one or more people, only one of which was specifically named (the protagonist, 50% female), and it was always neutral in valence. To create the self conditions, the named person was changed to ‘you’ ( ;  ;  ). The second sentence (8–10 words) continued the scenario and was the same across all Valence conditions except for one word, which was positive, neutral or negative. This critical word was always the either the sixth word (48 scenarios) or the seventh word (168 scenarios) of the second sentence. 

#### Valence and arousal ratings 
  
We obtained valence and arousal ratings of all six conditions of the full two-sentence scenarios from online raters (mean = 12.9, range = 8–21 raters per scenario) from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Mean ratings are presented in  . 



### Procedure 
  
#### Stimulus presentation and task 
  
Scenarios were divided into six lists with the six conditions counterbalanced across the lists. Each list included 216 sentence pairs (36 in each condition), which were broken into six blocks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the lists. Stimuli were presented on a projector in white font centered on a black background. Each trial began with a fixation cross of variable duration (most commonly 2 s but ranging up to 20 s) to introduce jitter. Fixation timings were determined using Optseq ( ). Each sentence of the scenario was presented on the screen for 4 s. 

Six comprehension questions were randomly interspersed in each block and appeared for 4 s directly after the second sentence of the scenario. The purpose of these questions was simply to ensure that participants were paying attention and comprehending the scenarios (see  ). 


#### MRI Acquisition 
  
Structural and fMRI was acquired with a 3T Siemens Trio scanner and 32-channel head coil. FMRI data were acquired over six 7 min and 38 s runs. In each run, 230 functional volumes [36 axial slices (anterior commissure-posterior commissure aligned), 3.2 mm slice thickness, 0.64 mm skip, 200 mm field of view, in-plane resolution of 3.125 mm] were acquired with a gradient echo sequence (TR = 2 s, TE = 25 ms, flip angle = 77°, ascending acquisition order). In addition, at the beginning and end of the scanning session, we acquired two T1-weighted high-resolution structural images (1 mm isotropic multi-echo Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo: TR = 2.53 s, flip angle = 7°, four echoes with TE = 1.64 ms, 3.5 ms, 5.36 ms, 7.22 ms). We used the higher quality of the two structural scans from each subject (based on visual inspection) for the subsequent analysis. 


#### MRI processing and analysis 
  
Preprocessing, first level and second level analyses of the fMRI data were conducted in SPM8. 

The first four images in each run were discarded to eliminate transient non-saturation effects. The next step was to detect spikes and interpolate these bad slices from surrounding images using the ArtRepair toolbox ( ;  ). On average 0.3% of slices (range 0 to 4.0%) were interpolated. Images were then slice-time corrected and the volumes were realigned to the first image of each run and then to each other. The functional images were aligned with the structural image by co-registering the mean functional image to the structural image. The anatomical images were segmented into gray and white matter, and the spatial normalization parameters acquired during this step were used to normalize the functional images to the International Consortium for Brain Mapping template for European brains. Finally, the images were smoothed with an 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. 

We modeled the data using a general linear model with the following regressors: one for fixation, one for the first sentence of each scenario, six for the second sentence of each scenario (one for each condition: Self-Positive, Self-Neutral, Self-Negative, Other-Positive, Other-Neutral and Other-Negative) and one for the comprehension questions. All regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. The realignment parameters for movement correction were also included in the model. 

To test our a priori hypotheses concerning the mPFC, we defined a region of interest (ROI) using the anatomical definition of the mPFC in MNI space (|x| < 25, y > 15, z > −5) from  ) meta-analysis of self-activations in the mPFC. This ROI includes the ventromedial PFC and dorsomedial PFC, but not the OFC (see footnote 1). To test the interaction of Valence and Self-Relevance within this region, we used a within-subjects ANOVA design matrix that consisted of one regressor for each individual subject and one regressor for the Self vs. Other contrast at each level of Valence. We set an initial voxel-level threshold of   P   < 0.001, and we inferred significance if the peak of any voxel within the region reached a familywise error (FWE)-corrected threshold of   P   < 0.05 using a small volume correction ( ). We report the coordinate, z-score and   P  -value of this peak. All reported coordinates are in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. 

Given the work of Beer and colleagues showing an important role for the medial OFC for self-positivity in social comparison tasks ( ;  ), we also conducted an exploratory analysis (using the same model as described above) of a second ROI, the medial OFC, defined as |x| < 25, y > 15, z < −5 in MNI space (i.e. all portions of the medial PFC ventral to the ROI defined above). 

In addition to this ROI analysis approach, we carried out whole brain analyses, which are reported in the  . 




## Results 
  
### Behavioral data 
  
Participants failed to provide a response for 3.1% of comprehension questions (an average of 1.1 of the 36 questions). For the remaining trials, accuracy ranged from 81% to 100% with an average of 91%. 


### FMRI results 
  
The small volume analysis in the mPFC ROI revealed a significant Valence x Self-Relevance interaction (peak MNI coordinates [0, 60, 22]; peak voxel level   p   = 0.047 small volume corrected, z-score = 4.26), see  . There were no significant main effects of Valence or Self-Relevance within this region. 
  
Activations in the mPFC ROI. A Self-Relevance x Emotion interaction was observed in the mPFC small volume correction analysis. Follow-ups showed effects of Self-Relevance for positive scenarios, but not neutral or negative scenarios. Voxels showing greater activity for self than other are highlighted in red (no regions showed the opposite effect). Effects are shown at a voxel-level significance threshold of   P   < 0.001 for regions where the peak reached a FWE-corrected threshold of   P   < 0.05. See   for the full list of peaks. 
  
We followed up the interaction by examining all pairwise contrasts with small volume correction in the mPFC ROI. In line with our predictions, follow-ups showed that self-relevant material elicited greater activation than other-relevant material for positive scenarios, but not for neutral or negative scenarios. This self-other effect within positive scenarios emerged in a cluster closely overlapping with the cluster that showed the interaction effect; the respective peaks were observed at [−2, 60, 22] and [0, 60, 22]) and 98% of the voxels in the interaction cluster were significant in the pairwise contrast. Effects were also seen in more dorsal areas of mPFC (see   and  ). 
  
Self-positive   vs   other-positive activations in the mPFC ROI 
  
We also examined pairwise valence contrasts within the self-relevant and other-relevant conditions. Here, the only significant activation was a cluster showing greater activity for negative than positive scenarios within the other condition (peak MNI coordinates [14, 60, 24], peak voxel level   p   = 0.002 small volume corrected, z-score = 5.14). Notably, this effect showed only partial overlap with the interaction effect; the peak was not included in the interaction cluster and only 53% of the voxels in the interaction cluster were significant in the pairwise contrast (with 69% of significant voxels from the pairwise contrast falling outside the interaction cluster). 

Within the medial OFC ROI, no significant main effects or interactions emerged, all   p  s < 0.19. 

Whole brain analyses comparing each condition to baseline as well as the full ANOVA design are reported in the  . 



## Discussion 
  
In the present study, we showed that the mPFC—a region that has long been associated with the processing or representation of the self ( ;  ;  ;  )—is sensitive to the self-positivity bias. Specifically, when participants read self-relevant and other-relevant social vignettes, without any requirement to make an explicit decision about self-relevance, we found an interaction between self-relevance and valence, with only the positive scenarios showing more activity to self-relevant than other-relevant scenarios. 

### A self-positivity bias in the mPFC 
  
This effect of the self-positivity bias was observed in the area of the mPFC that has been most strongly associated with self-related cognition (cf.  ). Although there is disagreement about the precise function of the mPFC and the degree to which it is specialized or specific for self-related (or social) processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), it is consistently modulated by self-related experimental manipulations ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). We therefore interpret our findings as supporting the idea that a core aspect of self-related processing is engaged to a greater degree when information matches positive self-views. This adds to evidence of representational similarity between positive valence and the self within ventral mPFC ( ) to suggest that the self-positivity bias is a basic, implicit aspect of the way we view the world. 

The present results complement the findings of previous neuroimaging studies that have focused on how the self-positivity bias emerges in explicit social comparison tasks or tasks that require some kind of potentially self-enhancing judgment. These studies have highlighted the role of the OFC in such decision-making processes (reviewed in  ;  ). In the present study, we did not find modulation of the orbitofrontal region. This, however, is not necessarily surprising, given that participants were not making any such decisions or judgments. The findings described here suggest that when participants are simply comprehending information about themselves, without making any judgments about themselves, neural effects of the self-positivity bias can manifest in a more dorsal region that is classically associated with self-processing. 


### Functional role of the mPFC in instantiating the self-positivity bias 
  
The pattern of effects observed in the present study is consistent with that seen in our previous ERP study using the same stimuli ( ). In that study, we also observed a significant effect of self-relevance in the positive, but not the neutral or negative scenarios. This effect was seen on the N400 component, suggesting that self-relevant scenarios generated predictions for positive information. We think that it is unlikely that the mPFC modulation observed in this fMRI study and the modulation previously observed on the N400 reflect precisely the same underlying neural activity or mechanisms. The mPFC is not generally thought to be a source of the N400, and due to their differing spatial and temporal sensitivities, ERP and fMRI often reveal different aspects of the neural response ( ).  Instead, we suggest that the mPFC modulation observed in the present study may reflect downstream processes that relate to the construction and maintenance of the self-positivity bias. 

Behavioral work shows that we are more likely to update our beliefs about ourselves in response to positive than negative information (reviewed by  ). This is an important way in which unrealistic self-positivity is maintained in the face of a disconfirming reality ( ). Interestingly, some previous fMRI studies examining how unrealistic optimism is maintained have linked mPFC activity specifically to belief updating in response to positive self-related information.  ) asked participants to estimate their likelihood of experiencing various adverse events before presenting the actual average probability of each event. After this task, they reassessed participants’ estimates of the likelihood of each event. They replicated findings (e.g.  ) that participants were unrealistically optimistic and that they updated their beliefs less in response to unexpectedly negative information than unexpectedly positive information. In addition, they found that the same part of mPFC that showed the interaction observed in the present study was related to tracking prediction errors and belief updating specifically for unexpectedly positive (but not negative) feedback.  ) replicated these results and extended them to people with major depressive disorder (see also   for general discussion). 

Further support for the idea that the mPFC may play an important role in constructing and maintaining the self-positivity bias comes from work on the neural basis of self-esteem.  ) have shown that functional connectivity between mPFC and ventral striatum is associated with state self-esteem, and structural connectivity between these regions is associated with trait self-esteem, both at the time of scanning and eight months later ( ). 

Although these possibilities are intriguing, it is important to note that the present paradigm does not allow for strong conclusions about the precise cognitive mechanisms represented by the mPFC activation we observed. Indeed, the mPFC has been implicated in many other processes. For example, it is also thought to play an important role in self-projection and counterfactual thinking ( ;  ). Thus, it is possible that the increased activity for the self-positive scenarios arose because participants were most likely to imagine themselves experiencing or acting out these scenarios. 


### Limitations and future directions 
  
It is important to mention some limitations of the current work. First, our sample size of 17 participants was relatively small. Although this is somewhat mitigated by the relatively large number of scenarios and ROI analysis approach, the results should be treated as somewhat preliminary until confirmed or extended in a high-powered study ( ). In addition, our sample was all females, mostly white, between the ages of 18 and 23, and all were students at an elite university. This means that we should be cautious about generalizing these findings. Although work on the self-positivity bias has generally not revealed significant gender differences ( ), the bias is likely to be particularly sensitive to other social and cultural differences ( ;  ;  ;  ). As we have noted previously ( ), we believe the paradigm presented her may be valuable for future research investigating such differences. 



## Conclusion 
  
In conclusion, our findings suggest that the mPFC, a region that has long been associated with the representation and processing of self-related information, is modulated by the self-positivity bias in a paradigm that probes self-relevant comprehension, but that does not require explicit decision-making or judgments about the self. Future research should continue to explore the neural mechanisms underlying the self-positivity bias and explore the implications for a social neuroscientific understanding of the self (see also  ;  ;  ;  ).

# Abstract
 
We evaluated whether task-related fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) activation could be acquired under conventional anaesthesia at a depth enabling neurosurgery in five patients with supratentorial gliomas. Within a 1.5 T MRI operating room immediately prior to neurosurgery, a passive finger flexion sensorimotor paradigm was performed on each hand with the patients awake, and then immediately after the induction and maintenance of combined sevoflurane and propofol general anaesthesia. The depth of surgical anaesthesia was measured and confirmed with an EEG-derived technique, the Bispectral Index (BIS). The magnitude of the task-related BOLD response and BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia were determined. The fMRI data were assessed by three fMRI expert observers who rated each activation map for somatotopy and usefulness for radiological neurosurgical guidance. 

The mean magnitudes of the task-related BOLD response under a BIS measured depth of surgical general anaesthesia were 25% (tumour affected hemisphere) and 22% (tumour free hemisphere) of the respective awake values. BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia ranged from 7% to 83% compared to the awake state. Despite these reductions, somatotopic BOLD activation was observed in the sensorimotor cortex in all ten data acquisitions surpassing statistical thresholds of at least   p   < 0.001 . All ten fMRI activation datasets were scored to be useful for radiological neurosurgical guidance. 

Passive task-related sensorimotor fMRI acquired in neurosurgical patients under multi-pharmacological general anaesthesia is reproducible and yields clinically useful activation maps. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the technique and its potential value if applied intra-operatively. Additionally these methods may enable fMRI investigations in patients unable to perform or lie still for awake paradigms, such as young children, claustrophobic patients and those with movement disorders.

## Introduction 
  
Image guidance using awake, pre-operatively acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is in many neurosurgical units an essential tool when resecting brain tumours. It enables accurate planning and intra-operative guidance, especially in the initial phase of the procedure. As surgery progresses however, cerebral structures on average shift by up to 9 mm ( ;  ), thereby compromising the spatial correspondence of pre-operatively acquired images. This ‘brain shift’ phenomenon, if unaccounted for, can therefore lead to inadvertent damage to critical brain areas. 

One way of addressing this problem is through the acquisition of intra-operative task-related fMRI ( ). Acquiring intra-operative task-related fMRI is more challenging than intra-operative structural MRI because fMRI relies on (i) the detection of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation ( ) which is known to be affected by anaesthesia ( ;  ;  ); and (ii) activation paradigms that are applicable for unconscious patients. To establish the feasibility of intra-operative task-related fMRI, it is important to establish whether task-related BOLD activation can be detected in patients anaesthetised to the depth required for neurosurgery. Recent studies have shown that BOLD activation in the resting state can be detected in neurosurgical patients ( ;  ;  ) and prior to these there have been several studies that have shown task-related BOLD activation can be detected in anaesthetised patients ( ,  ,  ,  ). In all of these studies however only a single anaesthetic technique, either intravenous (propofol with or without an opioid) or inhalational (sevoflurane), was used but not propofol and sevoflurane together. Furthermore in none of these studies was there a measure to quantify the depth of the subjects' anaesthesia at the time of fMRI. In standard clinical practice for tumour surgery, general anaesthesia is usually achieved with multiple pharmacological agents (which may include intravenous and inhalational anaesthesia) acting on the central nervous system to suppress consciousness and pain detection ( ;  ). 

Establishing the feasibility of detecting task-related BOLD activation in conventionally anaesthetised patients is a pre-requisite prior to the introduction of intra-operative fMRI and its acquisition under general anaesthesia following a craniotomy and exposure of the brain. The aims of our study were firstly to evaluate whether sensorimotor BOLD fMRI activation could be obtained under general anaesthesia at a depth permitting neurosurgery, using a simple, readily implemented passive finger flexion sensorimotor paradigm. We also aimed to determine the relative magnitude of the task-related BOLD response before and after general anaesthesia and the change in BOLD sensitivity, and finally to assess the accuracy of sensorimotor cortex localisation in the context of radiological neurosurgical guidance. 


## Methods 
  
### Patients 
  
This prospective study received institutional review board approval and all patients gave written informed consent prior to participation. Five patients with intrinsic tumours within the right cerebral hemisphere (two male, three female, mean patient age 33.7 years, SD = 8.9 years) were prospectively recruited following referral for neurosurgical management. None of the patients had undergone previous treatment of their tumours. The inclusion criteria for the study were: a) supratentorial glioma b) undergoing intra-operative MRI-guided resection and c) no significant cardiovascular co-morbidity to preclude prolonged imaging under general anaesthesia. Images of each patient's tumour are shown in  . Patient A's tumour was a World Health Organization (WHO) grade II oligoastrocytoma measuring 13.0 cm  and was centred on the right anterior cingulate gyrus. Patient B's tumour was a grade III anaplastic oligodendroglioma measuring 36.5 cm  centred on the right superior and middle frontal gyri. The posterior margin of the tumour was 1.8 cm from the hand motor region of the right pre-central gyrus and did not result in any distortion of the sensorimotor cortex. Patient C's tumour was a grade II oligoastrocytoma measuring 60.2 cm  and was centred on the right posterior temporal lobe involving the middle and inferior temporal gyri. Patient D's tumour was a grade II oligoastrocytoma measuring 38.2 cm  involving the right cingulate and superior frontal gyri. The posterior margin of the tumour was 2 cm from the hand motor region of the right pre-central gyrus with no distortion of the sensorimotor cortex. Patient E's tumour was a grade II oligodendroglioma measuring 0.5 cm  centred on the right supramarginal gyrus.   
The figure shows selected T1-weighted images of the patients A to E oriented in radiological convention showing the location of the tumour within the right cerebral hemisphere and fMRI activation clusters (image on far right). The clusters of voxels are colour coded to indicate the activation across the awake and anaesthetised states. Yellow voxels = activation seen only in the awake state. Blue voxels = activation seen only in the anaesthetised state. White voxels = activated in both states. In all patients the tumour was in the right cerebral hemisphere and so movement of the fingers of the left hand resulted in activation in the sensorimotor cortex of the right hemisphere. z = MNI co-ordinate for the slice.

### Clinical management 
  
The study was performed within an intra-operative MRI (iMRI) operating room at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, a UK national neurosurgical referral centre. The iMRI operating room consists of a 1.5 T MRI system within the operating theatre ( ). The pharmacological agents used at induction of anaesthesia are listed in  . These were the intravenous anaesthetic agent propofol, the opioid analgesic fentanyl and the neuromuscular blocking agent atracurium. General anaesthesia was then maintained using the inhalational anaesthetic agent sevoflurane. All patients, except patient D, also received an infusion of a second opioid analgesic remifentanil. The anaesthetic regimen and the dosages of the drugs administered by the neuroanaesthetists were not modified because of study participation. Systemic blood pressure, carbon dioxide concentration and oxygen saturations under anaesthesia were recorded ( ). Carbon dioxide concentrations were maintained within the normal physiological levels of between 4 to 5.7 kilopascals (kPa), with a respiratory rate of 10 to 15 breaths per minute (normoventilation) and blood oxygen saturations were maintained >98% with the use of increased inspired oxygen concentration as is standard clinical practice.   
The table lists the demographical, clinical and anaesthesia details of the five patients (A to E) participating in the study. Gender F = female M = male, Age = age in years at time of study entry. All patients had tumours in the right cerebral hemisphere and tumour location refers to the lobe containing the tumour (F = frontal, T = temporal, P = parietal). Tumour volume is in cm  and was measured following manual segmentation using ITK-SNAP 3.6.0 ( ). Tumour type refers to the histological diagnosis of the tumour (OA = oligoastrocytoma, AO = anaplastic oligodendroglioma, OD = oligodendroglioma, 2 = WHO grade II, 3 = WHO grade III). Anaesthesia refers to the drugs and dosages (mg = milligram, mcg = microgram, %) administered to the patients at induction of general anaesthesia (induction) and at the time of fMRI acquisition (during fMRI). For patient D, remifentanil was not administered (n/a = not applicable). BIS refers to the Bispectral index measurement of the depth of anaesthesia at the time when the fMRI was acquired, with a level of < 60 considered surgical anaesthesia. The BIS value is the average of the two measurements performed before and after fMRI. Three main physiological variables measured under anaesthesia are listed, these are (a) blood pressure measured in mm of mercury (mmHg) (b) end tidal carbon dioxide levels measured in kilopascal (kPa) and (c) oxygen saturation measured as a percentage (%). For sevoflurane and the physiological variables, the values during the left and right hand fMRI acquisitions are listed. 
  Table 1   

To quantify the depth of anaesthesia, measurement was performed with the Bispectral Index (BIS) Brain Monitoring System (Covidien, MN, USA). This system records a processed electroencephalography (EEG) measurement with scalp electrodes, resulting in a dimensionless number ranging from 100 (fully awake) to 0 (an isoelectric EEG), this value being the weighted sum of three descriptors which correlate with the depth of the hypnotic state. BIS is used in everyday clinical neurosurgical practice to measure the depth of anaesthesia and can minimise the risk of unintended awareness or excessively deep anaesthesia ( ). A BIS value of between 40 to 60 is considered appropriate for surgical anaesthesia ( ). The BIS measurement was performed twice, immediately before and after the fMRI was completed. 


### Functional imaging task 
  
The sensorimotor paradigm involved passive flexion of the patient's digits II to V at the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints at a frequency of 1 Hz ( ). The paradigm was performed by the same trained clinician (A.K.Y.) who performed the task on each of the five patients to limit any potential variability between patients. A single scanning run consisted of 10 blocks of finger flexion alternating with 10 blocks of rest. Both the task and rest blocks were 16 s each in duration. The total imaging time was 5 min 32 s. Right and left hand data were acquired in two different scanning runs, first on the right hand and then repeated for the left hand, eliciting activation in the cerebral hemispheres without and with the tumour. 

To ensure correct timing for the task, a monitor was displayed within the iMRI operating room which showed the second by second countdown for the periods of task and rest. The paradigm was performed firstly with the patients awake and repeated immediately after anaesthesia, before the craniotomy. When awake, patients were instructed to relax and not to contribute to the movement. The paradigm was selected for its ease of use, applicability to anaesthetised patients and its inter-subject consistency in eliciting activation in the pre-central and post-central gyri (primary motor and sensory cortices). 


### MRI parameters 
  
Data were acquired on a 1.5 T intra-operative MAGNETOM Espree Tim system whole-body MRI (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-channel head coil. Functional acquisitions consisted of gradient-echo echo-planar images (EPI) with voxel size 3×3×3 mm , repetition time TR/echo time TE/flip angle = 3100 ms/40 ms/90°, field of view (FOV) = 192 × 192 mm , matrix size = 64 × 64, and 42 slice whole brain coverage. A static magnetic field (B0) map using a double gradient-echo sequence was acquired for correction of susceptibility-induced geometric distortion of the EPI images with the following parameters: TR/TE1/TE2/flip angle = 630 ms/4.92 ms/9.68 ms/60°, FOV = 192 × 192 mm , matrix size = 64 × 64, 42 slices. High resolution T1-weighted images were acquired using a sagittally-acquired three-dimensional magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with voxel size 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.2 mm , TR/TE/TI/flip angle = 2250 ms/3.7 ms/1100 ms/15°, FOV = 220×220 mm , matrix size = 192×192, 192 slices. 


### fMRI data processing and analysis 
  
Preprocessing and statistical analysis of the fMRI data were performed in SPM12 (Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, London, UK), running in MATLAB 2012a (Mathworks, MA, USA). Spatial distortions in the functional data, resulting from non-linearities in the MRI gradient system, were corrected by use of an in-house developed software (NoGradWarp, SPM Toolbox) and applied to the EPI volumes and the voxel displacement map (VDM). Functional images were then unwarped to correct for susceptibility related distortion based on the VDM, spatially realigned to the first EPI volume, co-registered to the anatomical T1-weighted image, spatially normalised to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template and spatially smoothed with a 6 mm full-width-half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel to permit application of Gaussian random-field theory ( ). Subject-specific fixed effect analyses compared functional volumes for task and rest, for each hand separately. Activation was assessed in the pre- and post-central gyri (sensorimotor cortex), which was defined anatomically using the Automated Anatomical Labelling (AAL) atlas ( ). The statistical threshold was corrected for multiple comparisons within these anatomical regions and across the whole brain (  p   <  0.05). Results were also reported at an uncorrected threshold of   p   <  0.001 (  p   <  0.001 ) to replicate the clinical neuroradiological application of fMRI to neurosurgical planning, where too stringent a statistical threshold can lead to false negative areas of activation and inadvertent damage to functionally important areas. 


### Evaluation of the effect of anaesthesia on a) the magnitude of the task-related BOLD response and b) BOLD sensitivity 
  
The magnitude of the task-related BOLD response compared to rest was firstly measured using a region of interest (ROI) defined by the largest cluster of activation during the awake state within the MarsBaR toolbox in SPM ( ), scaling the parameter estimates for each voxel to the mean value across the entire ROI and expressed as a percentage (%). This was performed for each patient on each of their data sets relating to right and left hand activation when awake and under anaesthesia. The ROI was defined from the activation in the awake state because it was likely to provide a better indicator of anaesthesia's effect on the task-related BOLD response across a larger region of the sensorimotor cortex. It also ensured that the measurement was not biased to the anaesthetised state. 

To assess how the task-related BOLD response was affected by anaesthesia and the presence of the tumour, we performed a repeated measures ANOVA with factor 1, state (awake versus anaesthesia) and factor 2, hemisphere (ROI in tumour affected versus tumour free hemisphere). This was conducted in SPSS (IBM SPSS 22, NY, USA) with a statistical threshold of   p   < 0.05. 

Anaesthesia's effect on BOLD sensitivity was assessed by the use of t-score histograms ( ) which represented the number of activated voxels within each patient's ROI. Histograms were calculated for the tumour affected hemisphere when the patients were awake and under anaesthesia (t-score threshold of 3.1) with BOLD sensitivity defined as the ratio of activated  /  × 100%. The order of fMRI data acquisition, with the patients awake then anaesthetised, and selection of the region of interest for data extraction (voxels activated during the awake state) were both expected to bias sensitivity towards the awake state. Our approach therefore ensured that sensitivity in the anaesthetised state was not over-estimated. 

To assess for any association between anaesthesia (sevoflurane concentration and the BIS measurements) and any observed changes in the task-related BOLD response, the data were firstly visually assessed with scatter plots of the independent variables plotted against the ratio of:  / . Data were formally assessed for association using the Spearman's correlation coefficient (r ), with a one-tailed significance level of p < 0.05. BOLD response values are reported to 1 decimal place (DP) with correlation analyses performed on the raw data BOLD values to 4 DP. 


### Assessment of the clinical utility of anaesthesia fMRI data 
  
Three expert observers in fMRI (T.A.Y., consultant neuroradiologist with 21 years experience, L.M., senior clinical scientist with 14 years experience and A.K.Y, neuroradiological fellow with 5 years experience) reviewed each data set at a statistical threshold of   p   < 0.001  to determine if the activation was in the expected region of the pre- and post-central gyrus based upon localisation of the primary motor cortex using anatomical landmarks ( ). The data were determined to be either a) useful or b) suboptimal, based upon somatotopy, as to whether they could be used for clinically informing the neurosurgeon as to the location of sensorimotor fMRI activation. 



## Results 
  
### fMRI performed awake, prior to anaesthesia 
  
Task-related BOLD activation in the pre-central and post-central gyri was observed in all patients ( ,  ).   shows the magnitude of the task-related BOLD response for each patient which ranged from 0.7% to 1.4%. The group mean magnitude of the task-related BOLD response was 1.2% (standard deviation (SD) = 0.3) in the tumour affected hemisphere (left hand activation) and 0.9% (SD = 0.2) in the tumour free hemisphere (right hand activation).   
The table lists the fMRI statistical results. These are shown for each of the patients A to E for the task in each sensorimotor cortex when awake and anaesthetised. Hand L = left R = right hand movement. All patients had tumours in the right cerebral hemisphere and so left hand movement resulted in activation in the right sensorimotor cortex (tumour affected hemisphere). Movement of the right hand resulted in activation in the left sensorimotor cortex (tumour free hemisphere). k = number of voxels in the largest cluster, the height threshold was set at   t   = 4.97 (awake) and   t   = 3.1 (anaesthesia). x y z = MNI co-ordinates for the peak voxel activation in the cluster. The t-score is listed for the peak voxel of activation and the   p   values are given at three thresholds: uncorrected (P ), correction for multiple comparisons within the sensorimotor cortex ROI (P ) and across the whole brain (P ). 
  Table 2     
The magnitude of the task-related BOLD response are shown for the individual patients and the group. The upper table lists the magnitude of the BOLD response (%) for the left hand and right hand activation in patients A to E (to 1 DP). All patients had tumours in the right cerebral hemisphere and so left hand movement resulted in activation in the right sensorimotor cortex (tumour affected hemisphere). Movement of the right hand resulted in activation in the left sensorimotor cortex (tumour free hemisphere). The lower table lists the group results for the five patients. 
  Table 3   


### fMRI performed under general anaesthesia 
  
At the time of fMRI acquisition in the anaesthetised state, BIS measurements ranging from 29 to 56 ( ) confirmed the surgically-appropriate depth of general anaesthesia in all five patients. Under general anaesthesia, activation was observed in both the tumour affected and tumour free sensorimotor cortex in all patients ( ,  ). The clusters were mostly reduced in extent under anaesthesia, the exceptions were right hand activation (in the tumour free hemisphere) for patient D and left hand activation (in the tumour affected hemisphere) for patient E. The peak voxel activation in every acquisition surpassed a statistical threshold of   p    <  0.001  and were also mostly significant (  p   < 0.05) after correcting for multiple comparisons across the entire brain. 

The magnitude of the task-related BOLD response under general anaesthesia ranged from 0.1% to 0.5%, the group mean magnitude of the task-related BOLD response was 0.3% (SD = 0.2) in the tumour affected hemisphere and 0.2% (SD = 0.1) in the tumour free hemisphere ( ). 


### Reduction in the task-related BOLD response under anaesthesia 
  
In all patients, the magnitude of the task-related BOLD response ( ) was less in the anaesthesia condition. Compared to awake values, these were 25% in the tumour-affected right hemisphere ((0.3 under anaesthesia/1.2 awake) × 100%) and 22% in the tumour free left hemisphere ((0.2 under anaesthesia/0.9 awake) × 100%). This resulted in a main effect of anaesthesia (F = 8.7,   p   = 0.042) in the 2 × 2 ANOVA, with no effect of hemisphere (F = 0.54,   p   = 0.50) and no interaction between anaesthesia and hemisphere (F = 0.008,   p   = 0.93). Note however, that as the ROIs were defined from the awake state, activation was intentionally biased towards the awake state. 


### BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia 
  
The effect of anaesthesia on the t-score histograms from the tumour affected right hemisphere, is shown in  . In all patients, there was a leftward shift of the histogram indicating a reduction in the t-scores and the number of activated voxels surpassing the t-score threshold of 3.1 (  p   < 0.001 ). BOLD sensitivities under general anaesthesia compared to awake were 7% (Patient C), 11% (Patient A), 26% (Patient D), 45% (Patient B) and 83% (Patient E). BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia correlated with the ratio of  /  (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.9,   p   = 0.019) with increased sensitivity associated with a greater ratio.   
The figure illustrates the change in BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia. t-score histograms are shown for the patients A to E for activation in the right sensorimotor cortex (tumour affected hemisphere) resulting from left hand movement. The left histogram for each patient shows the t-score distribution of the voxels within the largest cluster of activation when awake (as listed in Table 2). The right histogram illustrates how the distribution of the t-scores within this cluster is altered under general anaesthesia. Voxels whose t-scores were ≥ 0 are shown. The red dashed line indicates the t-score value 3.1 (p < 0.001 ) which was selected to define voxel activation under anaesthesia. Activated voxels are those to the right of this cut-off. The total number of activated voxels when awake and under anaesthesia are listed. BOLD sensitivities (( / ) ×100%) for the five patients were: patient A 11% (16/147 × 100%), patient B 45% (102/226 × 100%), patient C 7% (13/178 × 100%), patient D 26% (65/246 × 100%), patient E 83% (71/86 × 100%).

### Assessment for an association between BIS and sevoflurane to the BOLD response 
  
The scatter plots in   show the BIS values (3A,C) and the sevoflurane concentrations (3B,D) plotted against the ratio of  /  in each of the five patients. In none of these was there evidence of a clear trend for the ratio to either increase with BIS or to decrease with increasing sevoflurane and the Spearman's correlation coefficients (r ) for these did not meet statistical significance. For the BIS these were r  = 0.7 (  p    = 0.094, one-tailed) for both the left hand and right hand. For the sevoflurane concentration, these were r  = −0.6 (  p    = 0.142, one-tailed) for the left hand and r   = −0.1  (  p   = 0.436, one-tailed) for the right hand.   
Scatter plots show the Bispectral Index (BIS) (A,C) and the sevoflurane concentration (end-tidal %) (B,D) plotted against the BOLD ratio for the left hand (tumour affected hemisphere) and right hand (tumour free hemisphere). The BOLD ratio is defined as:  /  (using BOLD values to 4 DP). r  denotes the Spearman's correlation coefficient.

### Clinical utility of anaesthesia fMRI data 
  
In all of the ten data sets, fMRI activation clusters under anaesthesia were assessed to be in the correct somatotopic region of the sensorimotor cortex, being wholly or at least partially encompassed by the cluster when the patients were awake ( ). Based upon this correct somatotopy, all ten acquisitions were scored to be useful for radiological neurosurgical guidance. 



## Discussion 
  
In this prospective study we demonstrated that under conventional anaesthesia, using a simple non-invasive passive sensorimotor paradigm, task-related fMRI provides neurosurgically relevant functional information. In five patients with cerebral gliomas anaesthetised with a combination of sevoflurane, propofol and opioids, significant task-related BOLD activation has been reproducibly obtained in a 1.5T intra-operative MRI suite. The pharmacological agents used for anaesthesia reflect real life clinical practice as our goal was for the conditions to replicate those encountered within the intra-operative environment without any alteration in the anaesthetic regimen occurring as a consequence of participation in the study. The surgical depth of anaesthesia at the time of fMRI acquisition was measured and confirmed in each patient using the Bispectral index, a technique unique to this study. 

In contrast to a previous peripheral nerve electrostimulation method used to elicit sensorimotor cortical activation in anaesthetised patients ( ,  ), the passive finger flexion paradigm performed replicates active finger movement fMRI paradigms which are performed pre-operatively in the work-up of neurosurgical patients. By performing the fMRI twice, firstly with the patients awake immediately prior to the onset of anaesthesia, we demonstrated the robust pattern of activation elicited by this paradigm. The paradigm was readily performed by a trained operator with no reliance on introducing additional specialist equipment into the iMRI environment, facilitating intra-operative implementation in anesthetised subjects. 

In all patients the fMRI activations were in the correct somatotopic region of the sensorimotor cortex with the activation clusters under anaesthesia mostly reduced in extent compared to the awake state. Despite this reduction, all the activation clusters were observed with stringent statistical thresholding. In most cases these activations remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons across the whole brain (  p   < 0.05), and all were significant after correction for multiple comparisons within the sensorimotor region or when using an uncorrected threshold of   p   < 0.001. In contrast to previous studies (such as  ), we selected the same arbitrarily high threshold for each patient because the aim was to investigate reproducibility across the patient group. Even though cluster sizes were mostly reduced under anaesthesia these were unlikely to have represented false-positive activation because (a) they were in the expected somatotopic region of the pre-central and post-central gyri and (b) activation was demonstrated in this region when the paradigm was performed with the patients awake using a stringent statistical threshold of   p   < 0.05 with whole-brain multiple comparison correction. 

The magnitudes of the BOLD response under general anaesthesia were 25% (tumour affected hemisphere) and 22% (tumour free hemisphere) of those observed in the awake state. The use of the awake ROI was expected to bias this BOLD measurement towards the awake state, however a reduction in the task-related BOLD response following anaesthesia is in keeping with previous reports in animal ( ) and clinical studies ( ;  ), as is the reduction in the number of activated voxels ( ). Although we were not able to control for the effect of condition order (anaesthesia after awake) upon the BOLD response, a reduction in the magnitude of the task-related BOLD response under anaesthesia was expected because the anaesthetic agents, sevoflurane and propofol, are known to affect cerebral metabolism ( ;  ) through an inhibitory effect on neuronal activation secondary to their action on glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission ( ). A reduction in the BOLD response was also predicted by anaesthesia's perturbation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) which has indirectly been shown to modify the BOLD response ( ;  ). Previous human studies have shown sevoflurane and propofol to both increase ( ;  ) and decrease ( ) global CBF, though at a regional level sevoflurane has been shown to consistently reduce CBF within the fronto-parietal lobes, the location of the sensorimotor cortices, compared to the awake state ( ;  ). In these prior studies sevoflurane was administered at concentrations ranging from 0.5% ( ) to 4% ( ) with this range including the concentrations of the drug in the current study (range 1.54% to 2.37% ( )). More subtle, localised perturbation of CBF and neurovascular coupling within the sensorimotor cortex may in part, have accounted for the presence of activated voxels under anaesthesia which were not observed in the awake state (for patients A,B,D,E). 

Alterations in the BOLD response under anaesthesia could have also related to changes in carbon dioxide levels which have been shown to alter CBF ( ;  ) however as the carbon dioxide levels were controlled at the normal awake physiological range throughout the duration spent under anaesthesia, this is less likely to have been a contributory factor. The reduction in the task-related BOLD response may have also in part, related to the difference in voluntary motor activity when the patients performed the paradigm awake, though a previous study comparing activation elicited by active and passive finger motor tasks on awake subjects showed that BOLD activation in the passive state was comparable to that achieved in the active state ( ). 

Concomitant with a reduction in the magnitude of the task-related BOLD response, anaesthesia also reduced BOLD sensitivity, illustrated in  , with reduced t-scores observed for all five patients. BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia intuitively correlated with the ratio of  / . There was no clear relationship however between the BIS values or the sevoflurane concentration and this ratio ( ). As all patients were anaesthetised with sevoflurane, propofol, fentanyl and a continuous opioid infusion of remifentanil (except in patient D), it was expected that the BIS measurement would be the best overall measure of the depth of anaesthesia rather than relying solely on the sevoflurane concentration alone or an equivalent measure known as the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). The MAC value has been used in previous sevoflurane fMRI studies ( ;  ) and is known to be affected by propofol and opioid analgesics ( ). 

Overall, the change in the task-related BOLD response brought about by general anaesthesia is likely to reflect the complex effect that each of the anaesthetic agents sevoflurane and propofol have on neuronal metabolism, CBF and their combined effect. Individual patient differences in sensitivity to anaesthesia relating to age, gender and genetic factors ( ;  ;  ) likely also play contributory factors. The small sample in this study limits further interpretation of the effect of anaesthesia on the BOLD response and any association with the BIS and further larger patient studies using a similar quantification method of the depth of anaesthesia would be required to investigate this further. 

Previous studies evaluating the effect of gliomas on the BOLD response have demonstrated reduced task activation in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the tumour using sensorimotor fMRI paradigms ( ) even when the tumours were not in direct contact with the sensorimotor cortex ( ;  ). In the current study none of the patients' tumours directly displaced the sensorimotor cortex, although three of the five tumours were in the frontal lobe with the tumours in patients B and D ( ) both within 2.0 cm of the hand region of the primary motor cortex. Tumour volumes (except for patient E) were also comparable to those detailed in these previous fMRI studies. Despite these similarities in patient characteristics, we did not find a significant difference in the task-related BOLD response in either the tumour affected or tumour free hemispheres. In otherwords, the reduction in the BOLD response resulting from general anaesthesia was not greater in the tumour affected hemisphere compared with the tumour free hemisphere. This has important implications for the intra-operative acquisition of task-related fMRI using this technique in patients with tumours. 

### Study limitations 
  
Currently, obtaining access to fMRI in anesthetised human subjects remains extremely challenging: our study, in common with previous task-related fMRI studies performed under anaesthesia ( ;  ), was therefore restricted to a modest sized cohort of five patients. Nevertheless, the reproducibility of sensorimotor activation across a total of ten separate fMRI acquisitions suggest that using this paradigm BOLD activation can be obtained within the neurosurgical environment irrespective of patient demographics, differences in tumour characteristics, neurophysiological changes induced by general anaesthesia and, most importantly, the combined effect of multiple pharmacological dosages. The small sample size limits inferential power regarding the trend to association between anaesthesia and BOLD response changes, although our observations are consistent with prior literature. 

The use of an operator dependent finger flexion paradigm may have resulted in slight differences in the timing and frequency of the movement between each patient's acquisition. To limit this potential variability the same trained clinician performed the finger flexion task in all five patients and our technical set-up ensured the paradigm timings were displayed in the intra-operative MRI operating room. Furthermore, our use of a blocked design paradigm versus an event-related design was predicted to limit any potential impact of slight variation across trials. 



## Conclusion 
  
The acquisition of task-related BOLD fMRI in anaesthetised neurosurgical patients presents unique physiological, technical and clinical challenges. Despite this we demonstrated that without recourse to a study-specific anaesthesia protocol outside of routine practice, during deep unconsciousness elicited by conventional neurosurgical anaesthesia, task-related BOLD responses can be detected reproducibly. Further, this could be achieved using a simple passive sensorimotor paradigm readily implemented in the intra-operative situation. Despite the BOLD response being reduced under anaesthesia, fMRI activations were in the correct somatotopic brain region and judged useful to support clinical management. These results provide foundational evidence supporting the next step in the acquisition of fMRI intra-operatively under the conditions associated with the resection of brain tumours, that is general anaesthesia, craniotomy and exposure of the brain. Quantification of the depth of anaesthesia during fMRI may be of benefit in interpreting the activation data. These methods may also be of additional value outside of the intra-operative environment, for example enabling task-related fMRI in patients not able to perform or tolerate awake active paradigms, such as young children or claustrophobic patients and also in patients with movement disorders.

# Abstract
 
Motor imagery (MI) for target-oriented movements, which is a basis for functional activities of daily living, can be more appropriate than non-target-oriented MI as tasks to promote motor recovery or brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. This study aimed to explore different characteristics of brain activation among target-oriented kinesthetic imagery (KI) and visual imagery (VI) in the first-person (VI-1) and third-person (VI-3) perspectives. Eighteen healthy volunteers were evaluated for MI ability, trained for the three types of target-oriented MIs, and scanned using 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under MI and perceptual control conditions, presented in a block design. Post-experimental questionnaires were administered after fMRI. Common brain regions activated during the three types of MI were the left premotor area and inferior parietal lobule, irrespective of the MI modalities or perspectives. Contrast analyses showed significantly increased brain activation only in the contrast of KI versus VI-1 and KI versus VI-3 for considerably extensive brain regions, including the supplementary motor area and insula. Neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum during VI-1 and KI was significantly correlated with MI ability measured by mental chronometry and a self-reported questionnaire, respectively. These results can provide a basis in developing MI-based protocols for neurorehabilitation to improve motor recovery and BCI training in severely paralyzed individuals.

## Introduction 
  
Motor imagery (MI) is a dynamic mental state during which representations of a given motor act are internally rehearsed in working memory without any overt motor output . With the remarkable breakthroughs over the last two decades in the rapidly evolving field of brain-computer interface (BCI), MI has become important in rehabilitation research . The neural mechanisms underlying the process of MI demonstrate functional equivalence with motor execution (ME), with the two sharing similar physiological and anatomical characteristics . During MI, increased brain activity is observed at the premotor, supplementary motor, cingulate, parietal cortical areas, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, which are also the principal brain areas involved in ME . Brain activity in motor-related areas during MI can induce neuroplasticity and reorganization of neural networks and can be adopted to control BCIs in patients with brain damage or disabilities . In particular, for patients with severe paresis, MI may be used as the sole method to produce motor recovery of a paretic limb without overt behavioral output . 

MI essentially requires numerous sessions of training because many individuals cannot easily conceptualize MI . It is a counterintuitive task involving a broad spectrum of processes ranging from visual imagery (VI) to kinesthetic imagery (KI), first- to third-person perspectives , and non-target-oriented to target-oriented movements . In disabled patients who do not produce overt motor output, it can be especially challenging to generate stable and continuous brain signal patterns . For a wide range of MIs, an understanding of the particular brain activation patterns during specific MI can help naive MI participants modulate their brain activity effectively and proficiently for neurorehabilitation or BCI control . 

Generally, MIs can be classified into two types: VI and KI. VI involves imagining visual images of task performance in the first- (VI-1) or third-person (VI-3) perspective, and KI involves imagining the sensation produced by actually performing the task . Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies for these three types of MI (VI-1, VI-3, and KI) have shown differential characteristics with substantial overlap among the MIs . Even though the results of these studies are useful in elucidating the physiologic mechanisms for enhancing the performance of BCIs or the effect of neurorehabilitation, MI tasks only consisted of simple, non-target-oriented MIs such as finger tapping and running. Since both BCIs and neurorehabilitation aim to facilitate functionalities using instruments in daily life, the selection of these tasks may have limited application. In real-world environments, functionality in daily living can considerably depend on individual ability to use instruments that enable disabled people to perform the basic activities necessary to reside in the community . 

Target-oriented MI, which involves the mental rehearsal of spatial-motor actions toward a target object, has been gaining research interest because it affords the possibility of better performance in neurorehabilitation and BCIs. Previous studies using electroencephalography have shown that target-oriented MI can enhance beta-band event-related desynchronization and larger beta-band event-related synchronization with better classification performance compared to simple, non-target-oriented MI . Among fMRI studies, spatial patterns of brain activity for target-oriented MI can be differentiated with ME, motor observation, or simple MI using multivoxel pattern analysis . However, no published fMRI study has investigated the spatial differences of brain activity for subtypes of MIs including VI-1, VI-3, and KI of target-oriented movements. From a practical perspective, imagery for target-oriented movement, which can be the basis for functional activities of daily living, would be more appropriate than non-target-oriented MI as a task for motor recovery or BCI applications. 

MI performance and patterns of brain activity can vary depending on an individual’s ability to form a mental representation of an action . In previous studies, pre-experimental assessments for MI ability were conducted to select good imagers by using self-reported questionnaires such as the Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ) or the Movement Imagery Questionnaire . Even though these questionnaire assessments are regarded as validated tools to estimate MI ability, they have limitations associated with the subjective assessments of participants on verbal rating scales . Mental chronometry is an assessment tool to evaluate the objective temporal congruence of the movement during ME and MI and is a reliable method to assess MI . Interestingly, assessment of self-reported questionnaires and mental chronometry have not shown significant relationship for any subscale or global MI ability, implying that these assessment tools reflect the multidimensional nature of MI ability and can be complementary . If the particular brain areas that are correlated with the results of a self-reported questionnaire or mental chronometry during target-oriented MI can be specified in fMRI studies, this information can serve as the basis for selection of good imagers and can be used to determine the expected spatial pattern of brain activation before fMRI. 

The purpose of this study was to explore the different characteristics of brain activation during target-oriented MIs between VI and KI in healthy individuals by using fMRI. We additionally aimed to investigate the correlation between MI abilities measured by a self-reported questionnaire and mental chronometry and functional brain activity using voxel-based analysis. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Twenty healthy, right-handed volunteers (mean age, 31.5 ± 6.5 years, 10 male) without any neurologic or psychiatric disorders were recruited in this study. Among these, two participants were excluded because one had difficulty performing a KI task and the other participant showed brain structural abnormalities on the MRI scan. Finally, eighteen participants (30.3 ± 4.3 years, nine male) were included in the analyses. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital. All participants provided written informed consent according to institutional guidelines. This study was performed in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations. 


### Evaluation of MI ability 
  
To evaluate the MI ability of participants quantitatively, the KVIQ-10 and sympathetic skin response (SSR), surface electromyography (EMG), and mental chronometry assessments were performed. Before fMRI scanning, participants remained in a quiet room and completed these four assessments sequentially. 

The KVIQ-10 consists of five simple gestures; the participants were asked to actually perform and imagine the movements after watching a demonstration performed by the researcher. The five gestures are forward shoulder flexion, thumb to fingertips, forward trunk flexion, hip abduction, and foot tapping. The participants self-rated the clarity and intensity of the MI of these five simple gestures by using a 5-point scale from 0 (no image/no sensation) to 5 (image as clear as seeing/sensation as intense as performing the actual movement) after imagining the gestures in the visual first-person perspective and kinesthetic modalities . 

The SSR has been used as a reliable method to evaluate MI ability on the basis of the rationale that electrodermal activity during MI would be similar to the actual performance of the ME . It enables assessment of the quality of arousal and attention during MI. For SSR measurements, surface electrodes were placed at the palmar (active) and dorsal (reference) sides of the dominant hand. After confirming no response of electrodermal activity for 30 s, the participants were instructed to conduct VI-1 or KI of hand grasping without ME. To avoid skin response adaptation, the interval between the trials was longer than 30 to 60 s, and the total duration of the test did not exceed 15 min . The trials were repeated twice for each task, and the peak to peak amplitude (mV) and latency (ms) of the SSR were measured. 

EMG was recorded to confirm that there was no actual activation of hand muscles during MI to confirm that it was distinct from ME. Additionally, a previous study reported that EMG activity during KI can be distinguished from activity induced by VI and ME on the basis of signal frequency . Active and reference surface electrodes were attached at the first dorsal interosseous muscles and the first metacarpophalangeal joint, respectively. 

Finally, mental chronometry was performed by asking the participants to grasp their hands for a certain amount of time (i.e., 10, 20, or 45 s). The experimenter randomly selected one of the three different time periods for hand grasping and only announced the beginning and end of the trial to the participants. After one trial of actual hand grasping, the participants were asked to perform VI-1 and KI of grasping their hands. During MIs, the participants counted the number of times they mentally grasped their hands and provided this information to the experimenter. The index of deviation from isochrony for VI-1 and KI was determined by calculating the ratio between the average duration of the actual and imagined hand grasping movements using the following formula: deviation index = abs (1 − (MI/ME)) . 


### MI training 
  
The participants underwent MI training to enhance their understanding, especially for distinguishing among VI-1, VI-3, and KI. The participants were encouraged to imagine grasping and releasing the target with the right hand. To control confounding factors that may affect MI, including the shape, size, and color of a target object, view of the first-person and third-person perspectives, and surrounding experimental settings, the participants were provided video images showing the action of hand grasping as a training guide. Two types of actions were used in the video images: grasping and releasing a green, rubber ball as a target object at 4-s intervals with a right human hand in a first-person perspective view (Fig.  ) and with a robotic hand in a third-person perspective view (Fig.  ). Particularly, to help the participants perform target-oriented first-person perspective MIs, they were instructed to imagine the following behavioral sequences: to identify the internal representation of the target, open hand toward the target, and gently grasp and release the target.   
Task guidance and design for the fMRI experiment. Video guidance was provided during motor imagery training to all participants for the target-oriented visual imagery in the first-person perspective (  A  ) and third-person perspective (  B  ). Experimental block design and instructions during the fMRI experiment are schematically represented (  C,D  ). VI-1, visual imagery in the first-person perspective; KI, kinesthetic imagery; ME, motor execution; PC, perceptual control. 
  

The MI training consisted of four serial sessions. First, the participants actually grasped and released the target with their right hand every 4 s while watching the video for approximately 15 min. During the ME, they were instructed to stare at the images of a hand grasping and releasing and to sense the finger joints bending and stretching to prepare for subsequent sessions of VI-1 and KI. Second, the participants were asked to perform VI-1 while watching the guide videos for 15 min, focusing on the visual images of grasping and releasing the target using their right hand. Third, the participants were asked to perform KI for 15 min, focusing on the kinesthetic sensation of the finger joints bending and stretching toward the target. Finally, the participants were asked to perform VI-3 while watching the guide videos for 15  min, focusing on the visual images of the robotic hand grasping and releasing the target. Additionally, the participants were instructed to alternatively practice on the perceptual control (PC) condition. This resting state without any ME or MI was used as a baseline condition and the participants practiced to familiarize switching between ME/MI and PC conditions in preparation for the fMRI experiment. Whereas the MI training was conducted serially from ME, VI-1, KI, to VI-3, the participants were able to freely switch among the ME/MI/PC tasks on their own during training sessions to easily recognize the distinctions through comparison of each condition. 


### Experimental procedure 
  
Before fMRI scanning, participants were provided with experimental instructions and auditory stimuli to familiarize themselves with the experimental settings, and the researchers ensured that the participants fully understood the MI tasks to be performed during the experiment. Since no participant responses were required during the scanning, the researchers checked whether the participants were awake and whether they had made any experimental errors (e.g., missing the specific condition in a session) at the inter-session interval. The experimental paradigm was presented with the Presentation software package (Neurobehavioral Systems, Davis, CA,  ). The participants were instructed to ME and MI for grasping and releasing the target with the right hand in the same manner with training during the fMRI experiment. The target object was only used during training sessions and removed during the fMRI experiment so as not to evoke tactile sensations which can substantially influence brain activity during ME. 


### Task design for the fMRI experiments 
  
We used all five conditions as a task block: (i) ME as the physical execution of grasping and releasing the target; (ii) VI-1 of grasping and releasing the target with the participant’s hand while only focusing on VI and not on KI; (iii) VI-3 of grasping and releasing the target with the robotic hand; (iv) KI of grasping and releasing the target with the participant’s hand while only focusing on KI and not on VI; and (v) PC as the baseline condition without any ME or MI. The block design was employed in a counterbalanced manner to avoid an order effect. This study adopted a balanced Latin Square design, allocating only four conditions in one session. A total five sessions were performed for each participant and each session consisted of seven task blocks. Among the five conditions (ME, VI-1, VI-3, KI, and PC), four conditions were included in each session. Thus, three conditions were performed twice and one condition was performed once in a session. Five trials of one condition were presented per task block. A total of seven blocks (i.e., 35 trials) were performed per condition, and the inter-session interval was 3 min. One trial lasted 4 s, and a task block lasted 20 s. Rest blocks between the task blocks lasted 15 s. Notably, the baseline condition, to which ME or MI conditions were compared, was the PC condition; the rest condition was not included in the analyses. Before scanning, the participants were provided instructions via a monitor through a back-projected mirror, and scanning was started in the middle of the instructions to reduce the scanning time. During the experiment, participants were provided with auditory stimuli of high- (1500 Hz) and low-pitch (800 Hz) sounds for 0.2 s and a fixation cross for 3.5 s as instruction aids. The high-pitch sound was used to signal the participants to open their eyes and see the instruction. The low-pitch sound was repeated 5 times within each task block to announce the repetition time point of the task since 5 trials for ME or MI were conducted every 4 seconds in one task block. During the PC condition, the participants were not allowed to perform any ME or MI, but were provided with the low-pitch sounds to create an experimental environment equivalent to that of ME or MI conditions. Auditory stimuli were binaurally delivered via a headset. The fixation cross was used to signal the participants to close their eyes to remove any visual guidance or information during the tasks. Examples of the task design for the fMRI experiment are schematically presented in Fig.  . 


### Post-experimental self-assessment questionnaire 
  
After the fMRI experiment, the participants completed the self-assessment questionnaire that consisted of questions for the three types of MI. The items consisted of self-evaluated questions assessing the ease of performing MI and its consistency, which were rated on a 10-point scale from 0 (difficult/inconsistent) to 10 (easy/consistent), and for performance, vividness, controllability, interminglement among MI types, and interminglement with ME, which were rated on 5-point scales from 1 (very poor performance, no vividness, uncontrollability, no other type of imagination, and no overt movement) to 5. 


### Acquisition of brain image data 
  
Image data were obtained using a 3 T scanner (Magnetom Trio Tim; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard 12-channel head coil. We used single-shot gradient-echo echoplanar imaging sequences, with axial acquisition of 42 slices per volume with interleaved acquisition. The image matrix was 64  × 64 mm ; voxel size = 1.9 mm × 1.9 mm × 3.5 mm; field of view = 240 mm; flip angle = 90°; TR = 3,000 ms, and TE = 30 ms. A total of 84 volumes were obtained per session. A high-resolution T1 image was obtained using the 3D Turbo-FLASH sequence, with sagittal acquisition of 208 slices. The image matrix was 256 × 256 mm ; voxel size, 1 mm ; field of view, 250 mm; flip angle, 9°; TR, 1,670 ms; and TE, 1.89 ms. 


### Data preprocessing 
  
Functional MR images were preprocessed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping tool (SPM12,  ). Slice timing correction was applied to adjust data for interleaved slice acquisition. All functional images were realigned to the first volume to correct motion artifacts with six rigid body spatial transformations. We resliced the realigned images and created a mean functional image, which was used as a reference image for the coregistration step. To spatially normalize the functional images to the standard template of the Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space (resampled at 2 × 2 × 2 mm ), the high-resolution structural T1 image, which was coregistered to the mean functional image, was normalized to the Tissue Probability Map template. The functional images were transformed to the MNI space by applying the deformation maps generated from the normalized procedure of structural T1 images to the template image. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, an 8-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel was applied to the spatially normalized functional images. The artifact detection toolbox (ART,  ) was applied to detect fluctuations in BOLD signals and head motion in the functional images. Outliers were defined as volumes where the scan-to-scan differences in the global BOLD signal normalized to z-scores were greater than five and the head movement was greater than 2 mm. The total proportion of outlier volumes was 0.33% (25 out of 7,560 volumes; 84 volumes × 5 sessions ×18 participants). Eleven participants showed no outlier volumes, and the maximum number of outlier volumes (seven volumes) was observed in two participants. Therefore, we did not remove the outlier volumes to avoid any signal changes in further analyses. 


### fMRI data analysis 
  
The preprocessed fMRI data were analyzed using the general linear model, as implemented in SPM12. During the first-level individual analysis, statistical parametric maps of the   t  -statistics were calculated for each individual using a boxcar function convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function without time and dispersion derivatives. The preprocessed individual functional images were high-pass filtered with a 128 s cutoff period to remove the effect of low-signal drift. Additionally, the six head movement parameters derived from the realignment procedure were used as regressors of no interest. FMRI data of each session were modeled with four regressors of interest, corresponding to task blocks included in a session. All brain activity during the 20 s time period of a task condition was included in the analysis. To identify the activated brain areas during MI and ME conditions, contrast images were calculated including (i) ME > PC; (ii) VI-1 > PC; (iii) VI-3 > PC; and (iv) KI > PC. Additionally, in order to investigate the activated brain areas among MI conditions, contrast images were calculated including (i) VI-1 > VI-3; (ii) VI-1 > KI; and (iii) KI > VI-3, and vice versa. The contrast images were used as the input data in group-level random-effect analyses using one-sample   t  -tests with age as a nuisance variable. Overlapping areas with brain activation were investigated using conjunction analysis (i) during all task conditions including VI-1, VI-3, KI, and ME in contrast to PC condition; (ii) during only three types of MI condition in contrast to PC; and (iii) during KI condition in contrast to VI-1 and VI-3 conditions . Statistical significance was set at an uncorrected   P   < 0.001 with a cluster-based false discovery rate correction of   P   < 0.05 . 


### Correlation between MI ability and brain activity 
  
Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the brain regions showing associations between the results of assessment tools for MI abilities and the brain activity of MI contrasts for VI-1 > PC and KI > PC. The KVIQ scores and mental chronometry indices were used as variables of interest, and age was used as a nuisance variable. Since high KVIQ scores indicate good MI ability, a positive correlation represents increased brain activity associated with good MI ability. Conversely, the indices of mental chronometry were multiplied by −1 because low mental chronometry indices indicate good MI ability. The indices of the VI-1 and KI subcategories of 10, 20, and 45 s were averaged and used as variables of interest after multiplying them by −1. Thus, in mental chronometry, a positive correlation represents increased brain activity associated with good MI ability. Statistical significance was set at an uncorrected   P   < 0.001 with a cluster size greater than 20 voxels. 


### Behavioral data analysis 
  
The data for MI ability were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test for ordinal variables and a chi-squared test for categorical variables. The data for the post-experimental questionnaire were analyzed using the Friedman test, and post-hoc analyses were conducted using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a Bonferroni correction applied, resulting in a significance level set at   P   < 0.017. The average scores and deviation indices of VI-1 and KI in the KVIQ and mental chronometry, respectively, were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The significance level was set at   P   < 0.05. Data analysis was conducted with SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). 



## Results 
  
### MI ability 
  
Table   shows the results of the MI ability evaluations, including the KVIQ, SSR, EMG, and mental chronometry, performed in this study. The average score of VI-1 in the KVIQ was significantly higher than that of KI (VI-1, 3.61 ± 0.78; KI, 3.03 ± 0.94,   P   = 0.014). Other evaluation methods did not show any significant differences between VI-1 and KI. The average scores of VI-1 and KI in the KVIQ were significantly correlated (  r   = 0.5088,   P   = 0.031), as were the deviation indices of mental chronometry (  r   = 0.791,   p   < 0.001). There was no significant correlation between the average scores of the KVIQ and the deviation indices of mental chronometry for either VI (  r   = 0.064,   P   = 0.801) or KI (  r   = 0.302,   P   = 0.224).

### ME and three types of MI versus the PC condition 
  
Table   and Figs   and   show brain areas that were significantly activated in the ME, VI-1, VI-3, and KI conditions in comparison with the PC condition. During ME, brain activity significantly increased in the left primary motor area (BA 4), supplementary motor area (BA 6), somatosensory areas (BA 1 and BA 3), and the premotor area (BA 6; Rolandic operculum). The left supramarginal gyrus, thalamus, putamen, lateral globus pallidus, and the right cerebellum (culmen and cerebellar tonsil) also showed significantly increased brain activity (Fig.  ). During the VI-1 condition, significant brain activation was observed in the left premotor area (BA6) and the inferior parietal lobule (Fig.  ). During the VI-3 condition, there was increased brain activity in the left premotor area (BA 6), bilateral inferior parietal lobules, left supramarginal gyrus, and right angular gyrus (Fig.  ). During the KI condition, the brain activity of the left supplementary motor area, premotor area (BA 6; including Rolandic operculum), bilateral somatosensory areas (BA 2 and BA 3), left superior and inferior parietal lobules, and the supramarginal gyrus was increased significantly (Fig.  ).

There was no common brain area showing significantly increased brain activity during ME and the three types of MI. Additionally, the common brain area was investigated with a more lenient threshold (uncorrected   P   < 0.005, and spatial extent of voxels > 10) , which showed brain areas exhibiting increased activation during ME and MI tasks (Supplementary Material  ).

### Kinesthetic vs. visual MI condition 
  
In the conjunction analysis among MI conditions, significantly increased brain activation was observed only in the KI > VI-1 and the KI > VI-3 contrasts; these common brain areas are shown in Table   and Fig.  , including the left supplementary motor area, premotor area (i.e., Rolandic operculum; BA 6), inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula, and bilateral supramarginal gyrus and cingulate gyrus. In comparison with VI-1, KI showed significantly increased brain activity in the left premotor area (i.e., Rolandic operculum; BA 6), somatosensory area, inferior frontal area, insula, right middle temporal area, cerebellum, including the declive and culmen, bilateral supplementary motor areas, supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal areas, and cingulate regions (Fig.   and Supplementary Material  ). Compared to VI-3, KI showed significantly increased brain activity in the left premotor area (i.e., Rolandic operculum; BA 6) and bilateral supplementary motor areas. Significantly increased activation was also found in the left superior, middle, and inferior frontal areas; bilateral superior temporal areas, supramarginal gyrus, left insula, left putamen and pallidum, right cingulate region, and the bilateral cerebellum (i.e., culmen) (Fig.   and Supplementary Material  ).

## Discussion 
  
The present study aimed to investigate the activation patterns of neural activity elicited by target-oriented ME and MI. Participants performed actual movements or imagined repetitive grasp-release of a target object with the right hand for four conditions: ME, VI-1, VI-3, and KI. During the three types of MI, the common brain areas with significantly increased activity were the left premotor area (BA 6; middle frontal gyrus) and inferior parietal lobule, which did not show increased neural activity during ME. Contrast analyses among the MI conditions showed significantly increased brain activation only in the KI > VI-1 and KI > VI-3 contrasts for considerably extensive brain regions, including the supplementary motor area and insula. Neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (BAs 11, 47) and cerebellum during VI-1 and KI, respectively, was significantly correlated with the MI ability measured by KVIQ and mental chronometry. 

### Common brain activations in the three types of MI 
  
In this study, the left premotor area and inferior parietal lobule showed increased activation for all three types of MI. These two regions were activated irrespective of the modality (visual or kinesthetic) or perspective (first-person or third-person) of target-oriented MIs for the grasping action; those may involve processes associated with internal representation, aiming, and grasping-releasing of the target object. In a previous study, the premotor and posterior parietal areas were included as action-specific activation sites for aiming, but not for simple actions such as squeezing or flexion-extension . This study indicated that motor acts, including preparation and organization of movements with specific action goals, and those involving movement simulation and object- or goal-directed tasks are the basic elements of functional organization in the premotor and posterior parietal areas, respectively. Another study also reported that the left inferior parietal lobule was critical to storing the hand postures required for interactions with target objects . 

However, the primary motor area was not observed as a common activated brain region in the three types of MI in this study. Although MI reportedly shares similar neural substrates of somatosensory-motor areas with ME, activation of the primary motor area during MI has been a matter of debate, as several studies have shown conflicting results . The premotor and parietal areas are most robustly activated compared to the primary motor area during MI, implying that these areas rather than the primary motor area may be better options for implantation of an invasive BCI . The results of the current study are in accordance with the previous finding in that the common brain regions activated by target-oriented MI training are the premotor and parietal areas rather than the primary motor area, regardless of MI type. Identification of activation sites and a thorough understanding of their physiological roles during MI training may allow proper site selection of electrode positioning for BCI implantation and could enhance the controllability of the BCI. 


### Kinesthetic MI 
  
Kinesthesia may include all levels of the organization of movements, including muscle tone, synergies, goal-directed movements, and action . It can necessitate mental representation for generating, integrating and perceiving kinesthetic sensory signals from position and planned action of the limb without actual movement and sensory input . In the context of neurorehabilitation, KI, rather than VI, has been recommended to promote better motor recovery and improve functionality in patients with neurologic diseases . In the current study, overlapping brain regions with increased neural activation in the KI > VI-1 and KI > VI-3 conditions included the supplementary motor area, Rolandic operculum, inferior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula, and cingulate gyrus. These brain regions, which are possibly engaged in the neural process of KI, were activated more extensively than has been observed previously ; it can be attributed to the complexity of the MI task, in that KI with target-oriented movement might demand more extensive neural recruitment compared to simple KI. Particularly, these brain regions included the supplementary motor area and insula, the activation of which occurs after MI training in stroke pateints . The supplementary motor area is a secondary motor area that is heavily interconnected with the primary motor area; it was believed to be involved in planning and pacing complex motor activities . Even though the mechanism is unclear, it may exert a suppressive influence over the primary motor area during KI by actively inhibiting the ME of the represented motor actions . From the perspective of BCIs, the finding that KI induced increased activation of the supplementary motor area compared to VI can be applied to MI-based BCIs, as the activation patterns of the supplementary motor area showed great predictive ability for imagined movement . In addition, activation of the insula may be involved in the integration of multimodal sensory signals for the generation of simulated actions, attributable to the kinesthetic components of MI . The insula can serve as the interface between body awareness and movement during KI by processing and integrating a wide range of sensory signals arising from the body to internally generate intentional movement . Further study is necessary to reveal the exact neural process underlying brain activation elicited by KI and to optimize KI-based protocols for BCI training and neurorehabilitation in order to facilitate the efficiency of motor recovery. 


### Visual MI 
  
Intriguingly, no brain region in the occipital lobe was activated during VI-1 and VI-3 in contrast with the PC condition. This result may not be attributable to the difficulty of VI, since the subjective assessments including the KVIQ and post-experimental questionnaire showed that MI ability, vividness, and interminglement among MI types during VI are significantly better than those during KI. In fact, the involvement of the primary visual cortex and adjacent areas in VI has been a topic of debate in the literature . Even though previous studies have reported the predominant activation of occipital regions during VI , other published studies have indicated that the parietal regions (BA 7 and 40) can be highly activated with slight or no activation of the occipital regions, including the primary and secondary visual cortices . In this study, VI-1 and VI-3 showed increased activity in the inferior parietal lobule. The inferior parietal lobule has been noted to play a crucial role in the processing of visual information: maintaining attention on the targets and responding to salient information and new events, which can be relevant to the tasks of VI-1 and VI-3 . Particularly, in the present study, brain activity was increased in the left inferior parietal lobule during VI-1 and VI-3, but only in the right inferior parietal lobule during VI-3. These results were consistent with a previous study which demonstrated that the right inferior parietal lobule can have a determinant role in high-order body or self-representation, and abnormal responses in this region can cause the misattribution of self-generated actions to external entities . In contrast, the first-person perspective may result in strong left-hemispheric activation of the inferior parietal lobule in the current study, which may indicate that this region has a prominent role in programming self-movements . 


### Visual and kinesthetic MI abilities 
  
A whole-brain regression analysis for MI ability and the activity levels of brain regions showed considerably different results for the KVIQ and mental chronometry. Analysis of brain activity in the VI-1 > PC condition showed only significant correlations with the indices of mental chronometry, while brain activity in the KI > PC condition showed only significant correlations with the KVIQ scores. These findings are consistent with results showing no significant correlation between the KVIQ scores and mental chronometry indices for both VI-1 and KI in this study. A previous study reported similar findings in that the self-reported questionnaire results for MI abilities and mental chronometry data did not show significant relationship for any subscale or global MI ability . This may indicate that the KVIQ and mental chronometry reflect different dimensions of MI ability for KI and VI-1, respectively, and can serve complementary roles in differentiating between visual and kinesthetic MI in fMRI studies. 

Interestingly, despite the different types of target-oriented MIs, good imagers for KI in the KVIQ and for VI-1 in mental chronometry showed increased brain activity at the orbitofrontal cortex (BAs 11, 47) and decreased brain activity at the cerebellum. This different aspect of brain activation in the two brain areas was also reported by a previous study, which reported that healthy participants showed increased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and decreased cerebellar activity after intensive MI training . The orbitofrontal cortex can be involved in learning or recalling sequential motor tasks with synchronization to external stimuli at regular intervals  During MI tasks in the fMRI experiment, the participants imagined hand grasping and releasing, sequentially, at regular intervals, accompanied by auditory stimuli, which may have led to activation of the orbitofrontal cortex in the participants. Conversely, we observed that the greater the MI abilities were, the more the cerebellar activity decreased. Even if the cerebellum plays a pivotal role in acquiring new motor routines, particularly in the early stages of the acquisition process , cerebellar activity can decrease as participants reach some level of automatization on the motor sequence learning task . This inhibitory effect of the cerebellum on MI was suggested by a previous study as was its opposing effect on the contralateral motor cortex during ME . The physiological mechanism underlying brain activity at the orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum during MI should be investigated in further studies, which will be helpful in distinguishing good imagers for specific types of MI with distinct patterns of brain activity using simple evaluation methods such as the KVIQ and mental chronometry, without neuroimaging modalities. 

This study had several limitations. First, no participant was excluded based on the results of MI ability assessments; thus, poor imagers might have been included in this study. However, even though KVIQ, SSR, EMG, and mental chronometry were conducted to evaluate MI ability, classification of good and poor imagers can be an arbitrary distinction based solely on the results of a self-reported questionnaire assessment as in previous studies . Since individuals who need to be trained in using MI modalities can show low levels of MI abilities due to cognitive impairment as a result of brain injuries, inclusion of all participants irrespective of MI abilities may yield more generalized results that can be applied in actual clinical practice. Second, EMG was not measured during fMRI data acquisition to confirm no actual movement during MI sessions. Instead, EMG measurements were obtained during MI training sessions before the fMRI experiment to confirm that no motor unit action potential was observed during MI as the participants were being educated. After the EMG measurement, the participants were trained to simulate the three types of MI without any actual movement of their hand for 1 h to adapt themselves in the fMRI sessions. Third, it was practically difficult to completely exclude visual component from KI during the fMRI experiment. The post-experimental self-assessment questionnaire showed a significantly high rate of interminglement among other MI types during KI compared to VI-1 and VI-3. Further study will be necessary to quantitatively measure and control the visual component during KI by providing feedback on the participants during MI training. Fourth, both KVIQ-10 and mental chronometry were performed only for VI-1 and KI in order to perform a consistent assessment. KVIQ-10, which should be conducted strictly according to the administration procedures, is an evaluation method solely for VI-1 and KI, and it was difficult to adapt for VI-3. 

In conclusion, the present study revealed the different characteristics of brain activity during target-oriented MIs in healthy individuals by using fMRI. The common brain regions activated during the three types of MI were the premotor area and inferior parietal lobule, irrespective of the different modalities and perspectives of target-oriented MIs. Based on contrast analysis between each MI condition, significantly increased brain activation was observed only in the contrast of KI versus VI-1 and KI versus VI-3 for considerably extensive brain regions, including the supplementary motor area and insula. Neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum during VI-1 and KI was significantly correlated with MI abilities measured by mental chronometry and the KVIQ. The characteristics of brain activity during target-oriented MIs can provide a basis to develop MI-based protocols for neurorehabilitation to facilitate the efficiency of motor recovery and BCI training for severely paralyzed individuals. Further study is necessary to reveal the long-term training effects for more complex tasks of each type of MI to advance training protocols in the field of BCI and neurorehabilitation.

# Abstract
 
We examined functional connectivity between the locus coeruleus (LC) and the salience network in healthy young and older adults to investigate why people become more prone to distraction with age. Recent findings suggest that the LC plays an important role in focusing processing on salient or goal-relevant information from multiple incoming sensory inputs (Mather et al.,  ). We hypothesized that the connection between LC and the salience network declines in older adults, and therefore the salience network fails to appropriately filter out irrelevant sensory signals. To examine this possibility, we used resting-state-like fMRI data, in which all task-related activities were regressed out (Fair et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ) and performed a functional connectivity analysis based on the time-course of LC activity. Older adults showed reduced functional connectivity between the LC and salience network compared with younger adults. Additionally, the salience network was relatively more coupled with the frontoparietal network than the default-mode network in older adults compared with younger adults, even though all task-related activities were regressed out. Together, these findings suggest that reduced interactions between LC and the salience network impairs the ability to prioritize the importance of incoming events, and in turn, the salience network fails to initiate network switching (e.g., Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ) that would promote further attentional processing. A chronic lack of functional connection between LC and salience network may limit older adults’ attentional and executive control resources.

## Introduction 
  
Studies have suggested that attentional control deficits in older adults are due to age-related changes of the frontal system, particularly the frontoparietal network, composed of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and anterior/inferior parietal lobule (Gazzaley et al.,  ; Campbell et al.,  ;  ), such that older adults typically show reduced activation in the frontoparietal network compared with younger adults (Ferreira and Busatto,  ; Geerligs et al.,  ; Grady et al.,  ). As a result, older adults become more prone to distraction (Gazzaley et al.,  ; Schmitz et al.,  ,  ; Lee et al.,  ) and this increased distractibility is linked to the general cognitive and emotional declines observed in older adults (Hasher and Zacks,  ; Verhaeghen and Cerella,  ; Whalley et al.,  ; Yerys et al.,  ; Wadlinger and Isaacowitz,  ;  ). 

The critical role of the frontoparietal network in the maintenance of attentional focus and execution (Corbetta and Shulman,  ; Petersen and Posner,  ; Scolari et al.,  ) and its age-related declines (Gazzaley et al.,  ; Schmitz et al.,  ,  ; Lee et al.,  ) has been investigated extensively by examining frontoparietal network activity. However, examining the frontoparietal network in isolation may miss important aspects of age differences in the functional circuitry of attention, as many human imaging studies and theoretical models have posited that attentional processes require large-scale brain-systems-level interactions between intrinsic neural networks (Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ). That is, attentional processing does not result from the activity of one single network alone. In particular, neuroimaging research suggests that the default mode network, including the medial PFC (MPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and precuneus, the salience network, which includes the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, and the frontoparietal network each are involved in implementing attentional processes in the brain, and also that they interact with each other. Converging evidence indicates that the salience network helps initiate frontoparietal network control of attentional processing for prioritized input (Seeley et al.,  ; Goulden et al.,  ). Thus, from a theoretical perspective, when the salience network does not filter out incoming sensory inputs appropriately and continues to activate the frontoparietal network for every sensory signal, it may lead to unnecessary depletion of limited neural resources and impairment of focused, goal-directed attentional processes. Consistent with this possibility, deficits in the salience network (e.g., decreased neural activation and connectivity between local regions within the network) are associated with attention deficits in both younger and aging adults (Lopez-Larson et al.,  ; Song et al.,  ; Cai et al.,  ; Zhao et al.,  ). 

However, the underlying neural mechanisms involved in attention deficits in the brain are still largely unclear. As discussed above, some evidence suggests that attention deficits are due to a failure of the salience network in prioritizing incoming sensory inputs at the initial stage (Lopez-Larson et al.,  ; Song et al.,  ; Cai et al.,  ; Zhao et al.,  ), whereas other evidence indicates that impaired processing efficiency within the frontoparietal network   per se   reduces the maintenance of attentional focus and execution (Zhou et al.,  ; Campbell et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ). That is, it is not clear whether increased age-related distractibility is due to a failure of ignoring distractors (i.e., salience errors) or maintaining concentration on a task (i.e., execution errors). 

In this context, we note that several studies have highlighted the role of the locus coeruleus (LC), a small nucleus in the brainstem that constitutes the major source of norepinephrine (NE), in determining processing selectivity in the brain. LC releases NE to almost the entire brain throughout its widespread efferent projections, namely the LC-NE system (Foote et al.,  ; Aston-Jones and Cohen,  ; Bouret and Sara,  ; Sara,  ). The neural activity patterns of the LC-NE system, between tonic and phasic responses, determine changes in large-scale neural network configurations (Zerbi et al.,  ) to bias neural processing selectively towards goal-relevant events (Mather and Harley,  ; Mather et al.,  ). Recent fMRI studies have demonstrated that attentional selectivity tends to be less pronounced when the LC responds to external events indiscriminately (Lee et al.,  ; Clewett et al.,  ). This reduced specificity of LC responses may induce the loss of attentional focus in older adults, regardless of the saliency level of incoming sensory signals (Lee et al.,  ). 

Neurobiological studies indicate that the salience network provides input to the LC-NE system (Ullsperger et al.,  ; Unsworth and Robison,  ; Zerbi et al.,  ), suggesting that communication between the salience network and LC-NE system is involved in prioritizing sensory events. Neurobiological and theoretical models support this view by showing that the LC-NE system has a reciprocal connection with the salience network, which in turn may increase the selectivity of attentional processes shaped by the salience network (Jodo et al.,  ; Rajkowski et al.,  ; Markovic et al.,  ; Mather and Harley,  ). Consistent with this influence of the LC, the salience network shows decreased activity when LC-NE system activity is attenuated by the   β  -adrenoreceptor blockade (Hermans et al.,  ). Given the involvement of the LC in salience network processes, it is possible that increases in age-related distractibility are partially due to diminished neural connectivity between the salience network and the LC-NE system, which in turn means the salience network cannot prioritize important information from among multiple events to appropriately activate the frontoparietal network. However, to date, the potential connection between the LC-NE system and salience networks that may be linked to increased attentional distractibility in older adults has not been fully investigated. 

In the current study, we examined age-related differences between LC and salience network connectivity. We hypothesized that the functional connections between the LC and the salience network decline in older adults (hypothesis 1). As a result, even in the absence of task demands, the salience network continuously and indiscriminately switches from the task-negative network to the frontoparietal network (Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ; hypothesis 2). To test these possibilities, we focused on the functional connectivity between the LC and salience network as a function of age group (younger vs. older adults) by using a pre-existing fMRI dataset (Lee et al.,  ). Given that this public data is task-based, we adopted a resting-state-like fMRI approach, in which all task-related activities were regressed out. Thus, our analyses can be more focused on the native and intrinsic connectivity between regions, without the influence of task-related signal fluctuations (Fair et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ). 


## Procedure and Methods 
  
### Open fMRI Dataset and Preprocessing 
  
The dataset used in the current study, from the open-fMRI repository , consists of 28 healthy younger adults (YA: M  = 24.39 years, age range = 18–34; nine females) and 24 healthy older adults (OA: M  = 66.95 years, age range = 55–75; nine females). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of intellectual ability, as measured by either education or the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (Wechsler,  ):   M  : YA = 16.85 vs. OA = 16.38 years;   M  : YA = 43.96/50 vs. OA = 39.75/50. 

We used high-resolution structural images for our analyses (MPRAGE; TR = 1,950 ms; TE = 2.26 ms; FA = 7°; 1-mm isotropic voxel; FOV = 256 mm) and five identical task runs of the dataset (142 volumes for each EPI; 41 interleaved 4-mm slices with no gap; TR = 2,000 ms; TE = 25 ms; FA = 90°; matrix size = 64 × 64; FOV = 256), in which participants were exposed to different levels of auditory and visual stimuli in terms of emotional arousal and saliency (Lee et al.,  ). The images were acquired on a Siemens 3T Magnetom Trio with a 32-channel matrix. Preprocessing was performed using the FMRIB software library (FSL ) including skull stripping and tissue mask segmentation (CSF/WM/GM) of structural images after bias-field correction; first three volumes cut, motion correction, smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 6 mm slice-timing correction, grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D data set, ICA denoising using ICA-AROMA , and 0.001–0.08 Hz linear-trends filtering and regressing out CSF/WM signal. To examine intrinsic functional connectivity unrelated to task-induced activity, all task-related activities were also regressed out (Fair et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ). For details of the task-activity related connectivity analysis and the task itself, please see the previous work (Lee et al.,  ). Finally, the preprocessed resting-state-like fMRI data were transformed to standard MNI 2-mm brain through the non-linear transformation matrix of structure-to-standard-brain using the Advanced Normalization Tool library (ANTs ). 

Through the preprocessing, we identified that one of the OA participant’s data was contaminated by severe motion across runs (mean framewise displacement, FD, and DVAR were 0.57 mm and 63.36, respectively). Because the severe motion can significantly reduce the estimation reliability of the functional connectivity (Power et al.,  ), we excluded this participant’s data from further analysis (final data   N   = 51; mean FD and DVAR were 0.054 mm and 12.45, respectively). 


### Whole-Brain Functional Connectivity Analysis With LC Seed 
  
Based on our hypothesis, we focused on the functional connectivity between LC and salience networks and ran a whole-brain functional connectivity analysis. To this end, we first extracted the mean time-series of LC activity from the preprocessed and task-activity-free fMRI data using a standard structural LC mask (Edlow et al.,  ). Using this LC time course, a multiple regression analysis was performed to estimate individual lower-level functional connectivity maps (i.e., seed correlation map) for each fMRI run using FSL FEAT. Then, a second-level fixed-effects analysis was performed across each participant’s functional runs. Finally, individual-level LC seed connectivity maps were inputted into group-level analysis of mixed effects using cluster correction (FLAME 1 + 2;   Z   > 2.57;   corrected   P   = 0.05) with two between-group contrasts (YA > OA) and (YA < OA). 


### Connectivity Network ROI Analysis With Salience Network Seed 
  
An additional network-ROI analysis was conducted to examine how the salience network may be coupled with the frontoparietal network natively beyond the influence of task-related activities. To this end, from the group-level LC seed-based analysis (see  ), we selected significant voxels showing age group differences within the previously identified meta-analysis salience network template (intrinsic network mask #4 in Laird et al.,  ), and extracted mean time course of activity of those voxels (salience network seed). The aforementioned connectivity estimation procedure was repeated for each individual and we extracted connectivity parameter estimates from the frontoparietal and default-mode masks (Smith et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ) as an index of the salience connectivity strength between these two networks.

## Results 
  
Whole-Brain connectivity analysis of the LC between age groups showed that, compared to YA, OA exhibited significantly reduced functional connectivity of the LC with the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and putamen ( ). These regions are considered to be the core of the salience network (Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ). To confirm that these regions showed reduced functional connectivity in OA constitute the salience network, additional spatial cross-correlation analysis with the previously defined salience network template (i.e., intrinsic network mask #4 in Laird et al.,  ) was performed and it showed a high degree of similarity (  r   > 0.358). This result indicates that the LC is connected to the salience network more strongly in YA than OA, suggesting that the salience network activity is coupled strongly with LC activity in YA but not in OA ( ;  ). Also, OA showed more connectivity of the LC with initial visual processing regions, including the fusiform gyrus extended from occipital to temporal regions, the lingual gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus ( ;  ).

 Please note the reported region labels are the peak value locations within the Harvard-Oxford structure atlas on each cluster (H = hemisphere; Z = z-value)  . 
  
Due to the reduced LC and salience network connectivity in OA, we hypothesized that the OA’s salience network could not differentiate between important and unimportant sensory inputs and that it might continuously switch the network configuration from the default-mode network to the frontoparietal network based on the previous model of how the salience network coordinates network switching (Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ). To test this hypothesis, we extracted connectivity parameter estimates from the previously defined frontoparietal and default-mode masks (Smith et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ) as an index of the salience connectivity strength between these two networks, from the salience network seed-based connectivity maps for each age group (see “Connectivity Network-ROI Analysis With Salience Network Seed” section). We found that the salience network was more coupled with the frontoparietal network in OA than YA, even though all task-related activities were initially regressed out. Conversely, OA’s salience network was less coupled with the default-mode network than in YA participants. This pattern was confirmed by a between-network condition (2: salience-frontoparietal, salience-default) and aging group (2: OA, YA) repeated-measures ANOVA, which revealed a significant cross-over interaction,   F   = 6.135,   p   = 0.017, partial-  = 0.111, and a main effect of between-network condition,   F   = 6.215,   p   = 0.016, partial   = 0.113 ( ). That is, despite all task-related activities having been regressed out before the connectivity analyses, the OA’s salience network is still excessively coupled with the task-positive network compared to YA and the task-negative network.

Additional correlation analyses were performed to see the relationship between age and each connectivity strength (i.e., LC-SN, SN-DMN, SN-FPN). As a result, we found that there was a significant negative relationship between the LC-SN connectivity strength and age overall,   r   = −0.511,   p   < 0.001, suggesting that the LC-SN connectivity decreased with age ( ). For the groups separately, YA’ age showed a significant positive correlation with the connectivity strength,   r   = 0.377,   p   < 0.05, but OA did not show such relationship,   r   = −0.131,   p   = 0.550. We additionally compared the correlation coefficients between age groups, and found there was a marginally significant difference,   z   = −1.76,   p   = 0.078. In the SN-FPN, there was a significant relationship between the connectivity strength and age overall,   r   = 0.276,   p   = 0.05, indicating that the increased SN-FPN connectivity, even in the absence of attentional demands (i.e., resting state), was associated with age ( ). On their own, neither YA and OA showed significant relationships between age and connectivity strength,   r  s < ± 0.09,   p  s > 0.662, and no difference between correlation coefficients between groups,   z   = −0.52,   p   = 0.603. In the SN-DMN, there was a marginally significant relationship between the age and connectivity strength,   r   = −0.243,   p   = 0.086, showing that there is a linear trend toward a decrease in the SN-DMN connection with age ( ). For each group separately, neither YA and OA showed significant relationships between age and connectivity strength,   r  s < ± 0.11,   p  s > 0.635, and no difference between group coefficients,   z   = 0.59,   p   = 0.552. In sum, these correlational results were consistent with the main findings that showed age-related mean differences of connectivity between intrinsic networks and regions.

## Discussion 
  
It is impossible to process every stimulus around us simultaneously at any given moment. Thus, we need to select what is important from our surroundings, and focus mental resources on those selected for sufficient periods of time to be able to process them (Treisman,  ; Carrasco,  ; Wolfe and Horowitz,  ). However, this attentional control ability declines with age, and older adults appear more susceptible to distraction and interference compared to their younger counterparts. These declines have been demonstrated through an extensive body of behavioral research (Madden et al.,  ; West and Alain,  ; Verhaeghen and Cerella,  ; Healey et al.,  ); subsequent imaging work has established decreases in the responsiveness of neural attentional control resources in older adults as well (Milham et al.,  ). Eventually, this increased distractibility in older adults is associated with more general cognitive and emotional declines, although perspectives differ on the fundamental nature of these issues (Hasher and Zacks,  ; Verhaeghen and Cerella,  ; Whalley et al.,  ; Yerys et al.,  ; Wadlinger and Isaacowitz,  ;  ). Some of this work includes convergent evidence from working memory research that specifically explores the effects of distraction in older adults (e.g., Chadick et al.,  ); we note that one recent review article proposes an LC-NE specific account of differences in performance in both working memory and attentional control (Unsworth and Robison,  ). However, despite work that confirms both the behavioral and neural implications of declines in attentional control, our understanding of the fundamental underlying neural mechanisms of how and why older adults are prone to distraction remains somewhat incomplete. Dysregulation in LC-NE function remains one compelling, but largely unexplored, explanation for non-optimal frontoparietal network activity during aging. 

In the present study, we examined age-related functional connectivity differences based on LC activity to provide insight into attentional deficits in older adults. In particular, we used a pre-existing task-based fMRI dataset that has exhibited task-based age deficits in attentional processing. Given the original findings from the dataset (Lee et al.,  ), we wanted to examine the intrinsic brain activity beyond task-based signal changes. A growing body of evidence suggests that the intrinsic brain activity (i.e., background neural signal fluctuation) plays a primary role in shaping task-based brain activity (Cole et al.,  ,  ; Bzdok et al.,  ; Tavor et al.,  ). Using the intrinsic network extracted from the task-based fMRI is a useful approach to investigate the neural basis of task-evoked activity (Arfanakis et al.,  ; Fair et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ). 

We found that older adults showed relatively reduced functional connectivity between the LC and the salience network compared with younger adults such that the signal fluctuation of the LC is coupled to the signal fluctuation of the salience network less in older adults than in younger adults. Instead, the LC showed stronger connectivity with visual processing regions, and the salience network was more coupled with the frontoparietal network compared to the default mode network, in older adults than younger adults, even though all task-related activities were regressed out. Together, these findings suggest that the interaction between LC the salience network fails to prioritize the importance of incoming events due to reduced functional connectivity, and in turn, the frontoparietal network is recruited continuously (e.g., Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ) even when it is unnecessary. This unnecessary coupling with the frontoparietal network, without differential priority for incoming events, may be the main source that limits older adults’ resources, inducing difficulty with sustaining attention and focusing on a specific task. 

If the salience network helps to switch network configurations as suggested previously (Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ), the reduced connectivity observed here should contribute to older adults’ distractibility. Due to this reduced connectivity, the salience network may not get adequate feedback from the LC in responding to sensory inputs, and thus the older adults’ salience network may fail to ignore incoming, but non-important, events. This presupposes that the salience network is more likely to be influenced by the LC in computing saliency level, and biasing processing selectivity of the frontoparietal network afterward. Alternatively, the LC-NE system may achieve processing specificity from inputs of the salience network, and it directly regulates the attentional control system (Unsworth and Robison,  ). If that is indeed the case, the increased distractibility observed in older adults is more likely to be an issue of inputs from the salience network to the LC-NE system, wherein the LC may not receive priority information from the salience network, leading to the LC sending excitatory inputs indiscriminately to the entire brain, including the frontoparietal network through its efferent projection (Corbetta and Shulman,  ; Cohen et al.,  ). Unfortunately, given the correlational nature of functional connectivity analyses in human brain imaging (Joel et al.,  ), it is difficult to rule out other possible nodes through which communication between the LC and salience network activates the frontoparietal network. In any case, however, the current results suggest the importance of functional connectivity between the salience network and LC-NE system in a cascade of a focused attentional processes: the failure of functional communication between them unnecessarily depletes neural resources by increasing excessive processes even for task-incidental sensory information ( ) and inappropriate recruitment of the frontoparietal network ( ). 

Our findings are consistent with recent work that has established older-adults’ vulnerability to distraction, showing that age-related attentional deficits are more likely to be from a failure in the early selection of important stimuli rather than an inefficient process of execution at the later stage (Schmitz et al.,  ,  ). Similarly, our previous findings demonstrated that older adults’ perception   per se   did not differ from that of younger adults in that older adults showed similar levels of perceptual specificity for task stimulus types (e.g., object and house) with younger adults, but older adults were worse at inhibiting irrelevant information (Lee et al.,  ). That is, older adults have fine perceptual representations of whatever is the focus of their attention, much as younger adults, but fail to inhibit representations that should be ignored. Extending previous findings, the current study provides a possible underlying mechanism suggesting that reduced functional communication between the LC and salience network in the brain contributes to age-related attention deficits. Thus, combining neurobiological studies that can isolate long-range neural connectivity between the LC and salience network more specifically (e.g., Kim et al.,  ) will be an important future direction to better understand these brain connectivity patterns and how they may be linked to age-related attentional deficits. 

Finally, it is important to note that there are several limitations to our study. First, the LC is an exceptionally small structure in the brainstem, and thus it is hard to locate its location in an individual brain. Although we used the standard LC structure mask, given the low-resolution nature of EPI and the current 6-mm smoothing and MNI spatial normalization, the LC signal we extracted as a seed activity inherently includes other signals from neighboring regions within the brainstem such as periaqueductal gray (PAG) or ventral tegmental area (VTA). Therefore, in future work, it would be beneficial to utilize a neuromelanin sequence to locate individual LC location on the native space (e.g., Clewett et al.,  ) and extract a seed signal without smoothing (e.g., Alakörkkö et al.,  ). Second, the LC is often confounded by physio artifacts such as cardiac pulsation. In the current study, we applied the ICA-denoising process to correct physio noise in the brainstem. Although the ICA-denoising is a promising approach to mitigate physiological influence at the global level (Lee et al.,  ,  ; Clewett et al.,  ), measuring individual respiration and cardiac pulse during future scans will be helpful to estimate the LC signal, as individual-based physio noise correction can be more focal and direct to the brainstem signal fluctuation correction (Glover et al.,  ).

Previous research indicates that risk for substance use is associated with poor inhibitory control. However, it remains unclear whether at-risk youth follow divergent patterns of inhibitory control development. As part of the longitudinal National Consortium on Adolescent Neurodevelopment and Alcohol study, participants (N = 113, baseline age: 12–21) completed a rewarded antisaccade task during fMRI, with up to three time points. We examined whether substance use risk factors, including psychopathology (externalizing, internalizing) and family history of substance use disorder, were associated with developmental differences in inhibitory control performance and BOLD activation. Among the examined substance use risk factors, only externalizing psychopathology exhibited developmental differences in inhibitory control performance, where higher scores were associated with lower correct response rates (p = .013) and shorter latencies (p < .001) in early adolescence that normalized by late adolescence. Neuroimaging results revealed higher externalizing scores were associated with developmentally-stable hypo-activation in the left middle frontal gyrus (p < .05 corrected), but divergent developmental patterns of posterior parietal cortex activation (p < .05 corrected). These findings suggest that early adolescence may be a unique period of substance use vulnerability via cognitive and phenotypic disinhibition. 
 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
Across the lifespan, problematic substance use has been linked to impairments in inhibitory control: the ability to regulate prepotent behaviors to facilitate goal-directed behaviors ( ). However, substance use initiation and escalation typically begin during adolescence ( ), when inhibitory control is still developing and ongoing brain maturation and specialization support the transition to adulthood ( ;  ). To this end, it has been suggested that diverging developmental trajectories of inhibitory control and other higher-order cognitive functions may increase vulnerability to problematic substance use ( ,  ), by way of early substance use experimentation ( ) and individual differences in psychiatric symptoms ( ) that frequently co-occur with problematic substance use ( ;  ). Supporting this perspective, recent work from our group has demonstrated that substance use risk factors, specifically externalizing psychopathology and impulsivity, are associated with poor inhibitory control and cortical activation differences among adolescents during an antisaccade task( ). However, it remains unclear whether certain periods of development are more sensitive to inhibitory control limitations associated with substance use vulnerability and if youth at risk for substance use follow different trajectories of neurocognitive development. 

Neuroimaging studies suggest that the protracted development of inhibitory control during adolescence relies on functional changes in brain regions supporting cognitive control across the lifespan, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex ( ;  ). Supporting a potential role of these regions in vulnerability to problematic substance use, poor response inhibition and reduced activation within the prefrontal cortex during inhibitory control tasks have been shown to predict problematic substance use in adolescence ( ;  ). Similarly, prior work demonstrates that, relative to healthy controls, adolescents with a family history of substance use disorders, who have an increased risk for problematic substance use ( ), exhibit divergent age-related activation differences within brain regions supporting inhibitory control, including the middle cingulate and frontal gyrus ( ). However, the field has yet to evaluate such relationships within the context of broader substance use risk factors, including dimensional measures of psychopathology. This prevents a comprehensive understanding of the developmental etiology of problematic substance use. Furthermore, given that earlier substance use initiation is associated with increased risk for substance use dependence, previous work suggests that early adolescence may represent a sensitive period for substance abuse ( ). Thus, characterizing the extent to which certain substance use risk factors might be associated with developmental differences in inhibitory control during distinct periods of adolescence is critical for developmentally-informed prevention and intervention ( ). 

Leveraging a large longitudinal sample that performed an antisaccade inhibitory control task during fMRI acquisition as part of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study, the current project characterized developmental differences in inhibitory control associated with substance use risk factors, including externalizing and internalizing psychopathology and family history of substance use disorder. Based on previous work implicating poor response inhibition in externalizing psychopathology, a latent construct characterized by behavioral undercontrol and impulsivity ( ), and prior work examining non-developmental main effects of externalizing psychopathology and impulsivity within a subset of the current sample ( ), we predicted that externalizing psychopathology would be associated with poor inhibitory control and reduced activation in regions supporting cognitive control, including the prefrontal cortex. Critically however, and novel to the current project, we further hypothesized that at-risk youth would follow developmental trajectories of inhibitory control that diverged from normative patterns, as would be predicted by current theories suggesting that neurodevelopmental limitations in cognitive control may underlie adolescent substance use vulnerability ( ). 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Participants were part of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Site of the NCANDA study. See   for complete study protocol. Briefly, an accelerated longitudinal design was used to study adolescent brain development starting at various baseline ages (12–21 years of age) with longitudinal follow ups. At the time of manuscript preparation, data collection included up to three time points (i.e., baseline and two annual follow-ups). In the interest of studying substance use risk and eventual initiation and escalation, initial enrollment for the NCANDA study targeted youth at risk for substance use based on measures of psychopathology and family history of substance use disorders (see   2.2  ) but with limited substance use. The study aimed to achieve a sample that consisted of approximately 50 % of participants at risk for substance use. Exclusion criteria included contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; e.g., non-removable metal implements), medical history that would compromise MRI (e.g., traumatic brain injury), and a current or persistent major psychiatric disorder that would interfere with testing (e.g., psychosis). The study protocol was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. Informed consent and assent were obtained from adults and minors, respectively. Participants were compensated for their participation. 

After excluding testing sessions (subject at visit) based on study-specific criteria (see   2.4   for behavioral exclusion criteria), the final sample for the current project included 113 participants (baseline age ranged from 12.27 to 21.96, M = 17.11, SD = 2.66). For the behavioral analysis, a total of 220 sessions were included. Among the sample, 41.6 % (n = 47) of subjects had data which met study-specific inclusion criteria for baseline and follow-up and 26.5 % (n = 30) had data which met study-specific criteria at all three time points. The final neuroimaging sample included 104 participants and a total of 183 sessions, with 45.6 % (n = 47) of the sample having data at both baseline and follow-up and 15.4 % (n = 16) of the sample having data across all three visits (see   2.6.2   for neuroimaging exclusion criteria). See   for sample age distribution and   for sample characteristics.

### Measures 
  
#### Substance use 
  
The primary focus of the current study was to characterize developmental trajectories of substance use risk factors. Thus, problematic substance use examined as a covariate in all analyses in order to account for inhbitory control differences that may be related to problematic substance use ( ). This variable was defined at baseline using an established scoring protocol from the Customary Drinking and Drug Use Record (CDDR;  ), where substance use was coded categorically and indicated whether participants exceeded age-specific National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for risky drinking (Exceeds Threshold Drinking; ETD; n = 29). This variable was selected for primary analysis to match our work with this sample using baseline and one-year follow-up data ( ). Furthermore, problematic substance use beyond this baseline characterization was uncommon in the final behavioral sample (weekly binge drinking: n = 17, weekly marijuana use n = 14; see Supplementary Methods for details), reflecting the isolation of substance use risk and relatively minimal levels of problematic substance use at this stage of the Pittsburgh NCANDA sample. 


#### Substance use risk factors 
  
Constructs indexing substance use risk in the current project, externalizing and internalizing psychopathology and family history of substance use disorder, were defined with regard to the original design of NCANDA (see  ). Externalizing (EXT) and internalizing (INT) psychopathology were assessed using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessments (ASEBA;  ). Participants younger than 18 completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR), while participants older than 18 completed the Adult-Self-Report after the age of 18 (ASR). Critically however, these scales are designed to measure the same latent externalizing and internalizing structures, but with developmentally-appropriate questions. Age and gender adjusted t-scores were used as continuous measures for both EXT and INT. The ASEBA measures were collected at each visit. Family history of substance use disorder was assessed using the Family History Assessment Module ( ) and was defined at baseline as having at least one biological parent or grandparent with substance use disorder symptoms (FH;   n   = 22). See   for correlations amongst substance use risk factors and other study variables.   
Correlations amongst risk and sociodemographic factors of interest. 
  Table 2     


#### Generalized cognitive ability and sociodemographic factors 
  
A composite measure of cognitive function, generalized cognitive ability accuracy (GA), was assessed with the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery ( ) and “paper and pencil” neuropsychological tests ( ). GA was used as a covariate (see   2.5   for covariate procedures) in analyses of inhibitory control performance and brain activation in order to provide broader context of any developmental patterns of substance use risk factors associated with antisaccade performance. This covariate is critical within the context of previous work characterizing antisaccade performance and inhibition as a domain-general cognitive function ( ). Specifically, since the GA measure evaluates several cognitive domains, this score allowed us to examine whether the developmental associations of substance use risk factors with antisaccade performance were specific to inhibitory control, while accounting for general differences in cognition. Similarly, gender and Socioeconomic Status (SES;  ), which was measured as a composite of parental education and income, were also examined as covariates to provide broader sociodemographic context of substance use vulnerability (cf.,  ). GA and SES information were defined from baseline visit data. Sessions missing GA (n = 2) and SES (n = 14) data were excluded from analyses examining these variables. 



### Rewarded antisaccade task 
  
Participants completed a rewarded antisaccade task during fMRI acquisition initially described by Geier et al. (2010;  ) and reported in prior work from our group on an earlier portion of this sample ( ). Briefly, each trial consisted of cue, preparation, and response epochs lasting 1.5 s each. During the cue epoch, participants viewed a white fixation cross surrounded by a ring of green “$” symbols, indicating that a trial would be rewarded if a correct antisaccade was performed, or a ring of blue “#”, indicating a neutral trial in which no money was at stake. The preparation epoch was indicated by a red fixation cross and prompted participants to prepare for the response epoch, during which participants were to make a saccade in the mirror location of a yellow dot that appeared in unpredictable locations along the horizontal meridian at 1 of 6 eccentricities (±3, 6, and 9 degrees visual angle, relative to fixation). In addition to these “full trials”, additional partial trials, which consisted of either solely the cue epoch or the cue and preparation epochs but not the response epoch, were presented in order to aid in the estimation of hemodynamic responses evoked during each epoch ( ; see   2.6.4  ). Participants completed four neuroimaging runs, each consisting of 28 full trials (14 neutral, 14 reward) and 12 partial trials (3 of each partial trial by reward type). Prior to starting the task, participants were told that they could earn up to $25.00 but were not informed of the exact amount of monetary rewards for each correct trial. This was done to prevent participants from tallying their earnings, potentially engaging non antisaccade-specific brain systems (e.g., working memory).

  Fig. 2   


### Eye movement measurement and scoring 
  
Antisaccade task stimuli were presented using E-Prime on a flat screen positioned behind the MRI scanner, which was visible to the participant through a mirror mounted on the MRI head coil. Eye movements were tracked using a long-range optics eye-tracking system (Applied Science Laboratories, Bedford, MA) that recorded eye positions through corneal reflections. At the beginning of each experimental session, a 9-point calibration was conducted to ensure accurate characterization of saccades for each participant. 

Antisaccade scoring followed the same procedure as prior work from our group ( ;  ). A correct antisaccade was defined by an eye movement with a velocity of at least 30 degrees/s and 2.5 ° visual angle from central fixation to the mirror location of the peripheral target ( ). Antisaccade errors were defined as those with an initial saccade toward the target that extended at least 2.5° visual angle (i.e. prosaccade). An error corrected trial was specified by an initial saccade toward the target and extended at least 2.5° visual angle from central fixation followed by a correct antisaccade to the mirror location. In the current project, both antisaccade errors and error-corrected antisaccades were considered errors in both behavioral and neuroimaging analyses. Trials in which the participant failed to make any saccade or had poor eye tracking were considered dropped trials and were excluded from all analyses. Testing sessions (subject at visit) were excluded from both behavioral and neuroimaging analyses if the proportion of dropped trials exceeded 30 % and/or if 50 % of total trials were dropped or missing due to incomplete acquisition. The overall proportion of dropped trials was low across visits (10.6 % at baseline, 11.3 % at the second visit, and 10.9 % at the third visit) and was not associated with substance use risk factors (Supplementary Table 1). 


### Antisaccade behavioral performance 
  
Behavioral analyses were performed in R 3.1.2 ( ). Generalized mixed-effects regression models with a logit link function (lme4 package in R,  ) were used to predict antisaccade correct response rate across trial-wise data. This logit link function was appropriate considering the binomial structure of the trial-level data (correct vs. incorrect). Critically, the use of generalized mixed effect models with trial-wise data reduces ceiling effects in mean accuracy distributions ( ). Random intercepts were estimated for each subject. Reward conditions (reward, neutral), age, visit, ETD, and substance use risk factors (EXT, INT, FH) were entered as fixed effects in a series of models (see below). Antisaccade latencies were modeled similarly but using linear mixed effects models and only included correct trials. Significance values were obtained through the Car package in R ( ). Potential leverage points were examined on session-mean performance metrics using cook’s distance with a threshold of 1. Only one session (subject at visit) exceeded this threshold and the pattern of significant results was unchanged when excluding this session. Consequently, this session was retained in the final analyses. 

Due to correlations among risk factors, a series of models were employed. First, to examine main effects, the association between antisaccade performance and each risk factor was first modelled separately. Next, given the interest in studying developmental trajectories of inhibitory control amongst substance use risk factors, each risk factors’ interaction with age was examined. Subsequently, in order to address the specificity of results, all other risk factors were included as covariates. Lastly, to account for sociodemographic effects and general cognitive differences, GA and SES were included as covariates in both main effect and interaction models. Unless otherwise noted, inferences are drawn only on those risk factors that remain significant across all models. 


### fMRI 
  
#### Acquisition 
  
Neuroimaging data were collected at the Magnetic Resonance Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh on a 3.0-T Siemens Magnetom TIM Trio. A magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) pulse sequence with 160 slices (1.2 × 0.938 × 0.938) was used to create structural images for functional registration and conversion into a standardized template. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) data were acquired using an axially acquired echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (field of view = 200 mm, 64 × 64 matrix, 3.125 × 3.125 × 3.200 mm anisotropic voxels, 29 slices, TR = 1.5 s, TE =28 ms, flip angle = 73°). 


#### Preprocessing 
  
Preprocessing of fMRI data followed the same procedures as other recent task-based fMRI from our group ( ;  ;  ). This included the removal of motion and noise artifacts (Analysis of Functional Neuroimages, AFNI; 3dDespike;  ), non-linear registration of functional data to a standardized structural brain (3 mm, MNI-152 template; 2009c), slice timing and motion correction (mcflirt;  ). Data was then smoothed with FWHM of 5 mm (SUSAN;  ) and a 0.00625 Hz high-pass filter was applied. Finally, data was scaled by 10,000 of the global median. Sessions were excluded if session-wise mean Euclidean norm head motion exceeded 0.9 mm (n = 5), there was poor EPI coverage across runs upon visual inspection (n = 3), or due to technical error (n = 8). 


#### Trial-level fMRI analysis 
  
Consistent with prior work using a subset of this sample ( ), we estimated BOLD responses at both the trial and epoch level. To estimate average trial-level BOLD responses, a general linear model estimating BOLD activation was generated using AFNI’s 3dDeconvolve tool. Trial types (reward, neutral) were modelled separately with a 4,500 ms boxcar convolved with a gamma function (AFNI's block 4). Individual regressors for correct, error-corrected, and dropped trials were modeled for each trial condition. We note that incorrect non error-corrected:   see 2.4  ) antisaccades were rare in the sample overall (less than 1 % of total trials) and did not occur in all subjects (69/104). Therefore, in order to ensure consistency of modeling across all subjects, these trials were modeled with the dropped trials. Partial trials were modelled similarly but with a 1,500 ms boxcar for cue partial trials and 3000 ms boxcar for cue and preparatory partial trials. Six rigid-body head motion parameters, their first order derivatives, as well as run-wise 0 through 3  order polynomials were included as nuisance regressors. TRs were censored if Euclidean norm head motion exceeded 0.9 mm. 


#### Epoch-level fMRI analysis 
  
Previous research has shown that BOLD activation varies amongst the epochs of this rewarded antisaccade task as participants assess reward contingencies, prepare a response, and execute an antisaccade response ( ). Therefore, we also estimated the BOLD response within individual epochs in a second model. Each epoch (cue, preparation, and response) was modeled as a separate regressor with a boxcar (1.5 s duration, scaled to an amplitude of 1; AFNI’s block 4) and convolved with a gamma function. Correct, error-corrected, and dropped/incorrect trials were modeled separately for each trial condition (Reward, Neutral) and each epoch. Partial trials were included as examples of each epoch to aid in the estimation of epoch-specific BOLD response ( ). Nuisance regressors and motion censoring methods followed the same procedure as the trial-level deconvolution. 


#### Voxelwise Analysis 
  
We examined main effects of substance use risk factors and their interactions with age in whole-brain voxelwise analyses predicting BOLD activity during correct antisaccade trials (AFNI’s 3dlme;  ). All fMRI analyses covaried for session-wise mean Euclidean norm head motion, visit number, and trial type (reward, neutral). Each model was tested on both trial-level and individual epoch-level BOLD parameter estimates. Voxelwise testing was limited to voxels with at least a 50 % probability of being gray matter in the MNI-152 template and full EPI coverage across the sample. Multiple comparison correction was conducted using a combination of cluster size and voxel significance. Parameters for thresholding were determined using AFNI’s updated 3dClustSim program (acf option), which determines cluster size threshold through Monte Carlo simulations based on averaged spatial autocorrelation parameters. Autocorrelation parameters were estimated from residuals of the subject-level deconvolution models with AFNI’s updated 3dfwhmx tool (acf option). This analysis specified that at least 20 contiguous voxels (faces-touching, AFNI’s NN1) initially thresholded at p = .005 were necessary to achieve cluster-level corrected alphas of less than 0.05 for both trial-level and epoch-level analyses. 




## Results 
  
### Antisaccade behavioral performance 
  
#### Reward and age effects 
  
The average antisaccade correct response rate (accuracy) was 78.85 % (SD = 15.69 %) and the average latency was 438.53 ms (SD =57.5 ms). Both accuracy (z = 4.98,   X   = 24.78, p < 0.001) and latency (t =-3.66,   X   = 13.36, p < 0.001) robustly improved with age (higher accuracies and shorter latencies with increasing age). Consistent with prior work using this task (Geier et al., 2010) and analyses within a subset of this sample ( ), rewarded trials were associated with greater correct response rates (z = 9.23,   X   = 85.01, p < 0.001) and shorter latencies (t =-7.60,   X   = 57.37, p < 0.001). Given that our prior work with a subset of this sample ( ) and the current project revealed non-significant interactions between reward conditions and substance use risk factors (Supplementary Table 2), additional higher-order interactions with trial type (reward, neutral), age, and risk-factors, were not explored. However, trial type was treated as a covariate in all behavioral and neuroimaging analyses. 


#### Main effects of substance use risk factors 
  
 Accuracy.   When considering main effects across the sample, both EXT (  z   = -2.05,   X   = 4.21,   p   = 0.04) and INT (  z   =-3.24,   X   =10.51,   p   = 0.001) had negative relationships with AS correct accuracy, suggesting that higher levels of these risk factors are associated with poorer antisaccade performance. Only INT (  z   =-2.16,   X   = 4.68,   p   = 0.02) continued to negatively be associated with AS accuracy when all risk factors were considered in a joint model. Both EXT (  z   = -2.15,   X   = 6.31,   p   = 0.01) and INT (  z   = -3.58,   X   = 12.82,   p   < 0.001) continued to be negatively associated with AS accuracy when covarying for GA and SES. FH and ETD did not predict AS accuracy ( ).

 Latency of correct trials.   Greater INT scores (  t   =-3.01,   X   = 9.04,   p   = 0.003) were associated with shorter latencies. This relationship remained significant when considering all other risk factors (  t   = -2.22,   X   = 4.95,   p   = 0.006). Further, INT (  t   = -3.62,   X   = 13.14,   p <   0.001) continued to be negatively associated with latency when controlling for GA and SES. EXT, FH, and ETD were not associated with main effects of latency ( ). As in the accuracy analyses, no other risk factors had significant interactions with age associated with latency. 


#### Risk factor interactions with age 
  
 Accuracy  . EXT significantly moderated age-related improvements in AS accuracy (  z   = 2.48,   X   = 6.15,   p   = 0.013,  a). The Johnson-Neyman technique, which specifies intervals of significance within continuous by continuous interaction terms ( ), indicated that greater EXT scores were associated with poorer AS accuracy in early adolescence until normalizing to the rest of the sample at approximately 17 years old ( a). The interaction between EXT and age remained significant when accounting for INT, FH and ETD (  z   = 2.64,   X   = 6.99,   p   = 0.008), as well as when covarying for GA and SES (  t   = 2.00,   X   = 3.99,   p   = 0.046). No other risk factors had significant interactions with age.

 Latency of correct trials  . EXT also moderated age-related change in latency, where greater EXT scores were associated with reduced latency in early adolescence (  t   = 3.63,   X   = 13.18,   p   < 0.001;  b). This relationship persisted when covarying for all other risk factors (  t   = 3.96,   X   = 15.69,   p   < 0.001) and when accounting for GA and SES (  t   = 2.84,   X   = 8.06,   p   = 0.004). As in the accuracy analysis, no other risk factors had significant interactions with age. 

 Speed-Accuracy Relationships in Externalizing Psychopathology.   Given the evidence for high externalizing participants to have lower accuracy and shorter latencies in correct responses during early adolescence, we performed a secondary analysis to examine potential speed-accuracy trade-offs as a function of externalizing psychopathology and age. This analysis revealed a significant three-way interaction between latency, age, and EXT when predicting correct response rate (  z   = 3.04,   X   = 9.27,   p   = 0.002) such that there was a significant relationship between externalizing psychopathology, latency and accuracy only in early adolescence. Specifically, in early adolescence, externalizing scores were associated with decreased antisaccade accuracy and these accuracy differences were largest for longer latencies. Thus, these results were not consistent with a typical speed-accuracy trade-off, where a lower correct response rate is driven by shorter latencies. See Supplementary Fig. 1 for visualization of accuracy and latency as a function of age and externalizing. 


#### Sociodemographic relationships 
  
Females had significantly shorter latencies (  t   = 3.82,   X   = 14.55,   p   < 0.001). Greater GA scores were associated with improved accuracy (  z   = 2.94,   X   = 8.64,   p   = 0.003). Further, GA (  z   = -3.08,   X   = 9.40,   p   = 0.002; Supplementary Fig. 2a.) and SES (  z   = -2.66,   X   = 7.09,   p   = 0.008; Supplementary Fig. 2b.) interacted with age to predict antisaccade accuracy, with patterns that mirrored the interaction between EXT and age. 



### Functional neuroimaging 
  
#### Head motion 
  
As has been well-described in previous developmental research, head motion was greater at younger ages (  t   =-2.74,   X   = 7.55,   p   < 0.001). No risk factors were associated with head motion or interacted with age to predict head motion. However, as described in the methods section, TRs during which Euclidean norm head motion distances exceeded 0.9 mm were excluded and all fMRI analyses covaried for average session-wise Euclidean norm head motion. 


#### Main effects of substance use risk factors 
  
In the interest of studying developmentally-relevant brain-behavior relationships, only significant main effects and risk factor by age interactions from the behavioral analyses were followed-up in neuroimaging analyses. At the trial-level, greater EXT scores predicted decreased activation in the left middle frontal gyrus ( ; Supplementary Table 3). Average activation within this cluster had a positive relationship with antisaccade accuracy (proportion of correct trials;   t   = 2.50,   X   = 6.23,   p   = 0.01), suggesting hypo-activation in this region was task-relevant to performance. EXT was also a negative predictor of BOLD activation in the right superior temporal gyrus (Supplementary Table 3). Among individual epochs, EXT was positively associated with BOLD activity within the thalamus during the preparatory epoch and had negative relationships with BOLD activation across frontoparietal regions during the response epoch (Supplementary Table 3).   
Greater externalizing scores are associated with decreased trail-wise BOLD activation in the left middle frontal gyrus (left). This association did not significantly interact with age (right). Shaded regions represent 95 % confidence intervals. Voxelwise threshold p < .005, number of contiguous voxels > 20, p < 0.05 corrected. 
  Fig. 4   

Specifically among trial-level data, greater INT scores were associated with decreased activity in frontoparietal regions (inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, middle frontal gyrus; Supplementary Table 3) and greater GA scores predicted increased activity in the left precuneus (Supplementary Table 3). 


#### Risk factor and sociodemographic interactions with age 
  
At the trial-level, there was a significant GA and age interaction in the right middle frontal gyrus ( ; Supplementary Fig. 3) such that greater GA scores predicted decreased activity in this region with increasing age. Average activation within this cluster was a positive predictor of antisaccade accuracy (  t   = 2.25,   X   = 5.04,   p   = 0.025). Further, SES interacted with age to predict BOLD activity in the inferior parietal lobule such that greater SES was associated with decreased activity in this region with increasing age ( ; Supplementary Fig. 3).

  Table 4     

At the epoch-level, EXT moderated age-related BOLD activity within the left posterior parietal cortex ( ;  ) in the cue epoch. Mean activation within this cluster did not predict antisaccade accuracy (proportion of correct trials;   t   = 0.46,   X   =0.21,   p   = 0.65) or latency (  t   = 1.24,   X   =15.40,   p   = 0.21). Mirroring similarities with EXT in behavioral data, GA and SES also interacted with age to predict BOLD activation within individual epochs. Specifically, greater GA scores were associated with decreased activation with increasing age in bilateral precuneus in the preparatory epoch but were associated with increased activation with increasing age in the left precuneus and right insula during the response epoch ( ; Supplementary Fig. 4). Greater SES scores were associated with increased activity in the left angular gyrus with increasing age during the cue epoch but decreased activity with increasing age in the left inferior parietal lobule during the preparatory epoch ( ; Supplementary Figs. 5).

## Discussion 
  
The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between age-related trajectories of inhibitory control and substance use risk factors. Our findings indicate that higher levels of externalizing psychopathology are associated with lower accuracy and shorter latencies in early adolescence that normalized at later ages. Neuroimaging results revealed that externalizing psychopathology was associated with both hypo-activation in the middle frontal gyrus at all ages and age-related increases in posterior parietal cortex activation during early adolescence. 

### Substance use risk factors and developmental improvements in inhibitory control 
  
We found that greater externalizing scores were associated with lower correct response rates in the antisaccade task. This result is consistent with our previous findings within a subset of the current sample ( ), and supports theories relating disinhibitory phenotypes of substance use risk with poor response inhibition ( ;  ). We further sought to investigate how the relationship between inhibitory control limitations and substance use risk changes developmentally. Consistent with previous work, antisaccade accuracy and latency improved throughout adolescent development ( ). However, our findings indicate divergent developmental trajectories of inhibitory control with respect to the degree of substance use risk factors. Specifically, we show that greater levels of externalizing psychopathology were associated with poorer antisaccade accuracy and shorter latencies in early adolescence. However, secondary analyses revealed a nuanced relationship between latency and accuracy in high externalizing youth during early adolescence, where the largest differences in correct response rate where observed at longer latencies. Thus, these findings do not support a speed accuracy trade-off model of impulsivity in which high impulsivity is associated with rapid and error-prone responses in cognitive tasks ( ). Rather, they may be consistent with differences in an overall response strategy that differentially emphasizes speed or accuracy, depending on task demands. Our results further suggest such response differences are most evident in early adolescence, followed by a pattern of equifinality. However, despite poor response inhibition in early adolescence, high externalizing scores were associated with accelerated age-related improvements in accuracy to establish normative performance levels by late adolescence. Similarly, shorter latencies in early adolescence normalized by late adolescence. These developmental differences may reflect shifts in strategies to optimize performance throughout development and compensate for inhibitory control limitations in early adolescence, as high externalizing youth gain more top-down control of behavior. To this end, additional work may more directly test developmental changes in speed-accuracy trade-offs and decision-making strategies in more explicit computational frameworks (e.g., drift diffusion modeling) in externalizing youth. 

Although previous work implicates cognitive control deficits in youth with a family history of substance use disorder ( ), this risk factor was not associated with differences in antisaccade performance in the current study. However, our analyses with this risk factor had limited statistical power due to few family history positive subjects within the sample. In contrast, and relatively unexpectedly, internalizing psychopathology was associated with low correct response rate and shorter latencies across development. More clarity on family history and internalizing psychopathology within inhibitory control paradigms will require future work examining broad multidimensional high-risk profiles (see   4.3  ). Nevertheless, externalizing psychopathology was the only substance use risk factor that moderated age-related change in antisaccade performance, providing some support that externalizing psychopathology may be uniquely associated with developmental differences in inhibitory control. To this end, the externalizing by age interaction remained significant when covarying other risk factors, as well as generalized cognitive ability and socioeconomic status. Taken together, these results highlight early adolescence as a potential period of increased substance use vulnerability by way of developmental differences in response inhibition and disinhibitory phenotypes. 


### Substance use risk factors and brain systems supporting inhibitory control 
  
Converging with previous research examining prospective prediction of substance use initiation and high-risk profiles, internalizing and externalizing substance use risk factors in the current project were associated with decreased BOLD activation across frontoparietal regions during response inhibition ( ;  ). Further, supporting previous work implicating poor top-down control in externalizing psychopathology ( ), greater levels of externalizing psychopathology were associated with decreased trial-level activation in the left middle frontal gyrus. Given that this finding occurs at the trial-level and activation in this region predicted antisaccade accuracy, poor inhibitory control performance associated with high externalizing may be marked by limitations in broad inhibitory control processes mediated by the middle frontal gyrus. Further, this relationship may represent a general trait-level feature of externalizing psychopathology as it was stable across development. This relationship may also index a trait-level feature of general psychopathology as internalizing psychopathology was also associated with developmentally-stable decreased activation in frontoparietal regions. In contrast to common developmentally-stable effects, externalizing psychopathology was uniquely associated with developmental differences in posterior parietal cortex activity during the cue epoch of the antisaccade task, where high externalizing scores were associated with increasing activation with age in this region. The developmental association of posterior parietal cortex activation with externalizing psychopathology as a substance use risk factor is consistent with previous research showing that posterior parietal cortex activation differences are associated with adolescent substance use ( ) and substance use vulnerability ( ) and age of substance use initiation ( ) during working memory tasks. Although the sign of activation may differ based on task demands, activation differences in the posterior parietal cortex may represent a common developmental neural correlate underlying substance use risk across cognitive tasks. Supporting this, the posterior parietal cortex is implicated in attentional control, a function supporting both working memory and inhibitory control ( ;  ). In addition, previous research has found that trait impulsivity is positively correlated with vulnerability to distraction by reward cues ( ). Therefore, since parietal cortex activation differences related to externalizing psychopathology occurred during the incentive cue epoch, this finding may reflect developmental differences associated with orienting attention to reward contingency cues. 

Previous work characterizing normative functional development of the parietal cortex indicates this region does not exhibit age-related changes during the antisaccade task ( ) but its function decreases with age to support working memory development ( ). Diverging from these patterns, greater levels of externalizing psychopathology were associated with increasing engagement of the posterior parietal cortex across development, which was not observed for low levels of externalizing psychopathology and in more normative subjects (cf.,  ). Given that differences in antisaccade performance associated with externalizing psychopathology are most evident in early adolescence and normalize with age, age-related increases in posterior parietal cortex activation may reflect a compensatory mechanism that serves to optimize performance across development. However, in the absence of a significant association between activity in this region and antisaccade behavioral performance, the functional contribution of parietal cortex activity to developmental differences in inhibitory control performance associated with externalizing psychopathology remains unclear. Future work may employ tasks targeting multiple cognitive functions (e.g., inhibition, attentional control:  ; working memory:  ) to examine general and specific activation patterns in the posterior parietal cortex that may underlie the developmental differences of cognitive control in risk for substance use. 


### Common and specific neurocognitive profiles of substance use risk factors 
  
In addition to characterizing development trajectories associated with substance use risk factors, we investigated developmental differences in broader sociodemographic factors, including generalized cognitive ability accuracy and socioeconomic status. Mirroring developmental differences associated with externalizing psychopathology, lower levels of generalized cognitive ability and socioeconomic status were associated with decreased antisaccade correct response rates in early adolescence that normalized in late adolescence and early adulthood. These results indicate a potential common developmental pattern of equifinality across sociodemographic and psychopathology risk factors. Taken together with previous work characterizing the interrelationships amongst socioeconomic status, executive functioning, and psychopathology ( ;  ), these results support theories suggesting substance use risk may best be represented using dimensional constructs encompassing multiple facets of risk factors (e.g., neurobehavioral disinhibition;  ). However, our results also suggest that each risk factor may be associated with independent developmental processes underlying inhibitory control maturation. Supporting this, differences in age-related improvements in antisaccade   latency   was specific to externalizing psychopathology. Further, generalized cognitive ability, socioeconomic status, and externalizing psychopathology were associated with developmental differences in non-overlapping brain regions. Specifically, greater levels of generalized cognitive ability and socioeconomic status were associated with BOLD activity that decreased with age in the middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobules, respectively. Thus, our data indicate potential compensatory mechanisms may be differentially relevant to each risk factor. Future research may further evaluate individual differences in neurocognitive mechanisms underlying developmental patterns of equifinality in inhibitory control common across substance use risk and sociodemographic factors. 


### Limitations 
  
The present study is characterized by a number of strengths, including a relatively large longitudinal neuroimaging sample and use of continuous measures of substance use risk factors. This approach allowed us to identify the relative magnitude of substance use risk factors and distinct age ranges in which differences in inhibitory control were most evident. Such a characterization of individual differences in inhibitory control across development and among multiple risk factors highlights the importance of studying dimensional constructs of psychopathology (Research Domain Criteria;  ). However, in the current sample, a relatively small proportion of the sample exceeded the described threshold of alcohol use at baseline and few participants initiated problematic substance use at follow-up visits. This limited our ability to examine how problematic substance use initiation and escalation may perturb normative development of inhibitory control. Similarly, relatively few participants met criteria for a family history of substance use disorder. Therefore, our study was less powered compared to previous studies that have characterized developmental differences in youth with a family history of substance use disorder ( ). With respect to previous work highlighting cognitive control deficits in youth with a family history of substance use disorder ( ) and substance use initiation in adolescence ( ), future research leveraging large-scale initiatives such as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and broader datasets within the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) will be critical in characterizing developmental differences associated with family history of substance use disorder and subsequent substance use escalation. 



## Conclusion 
  
Our findings indicate that substance use risk factors are associated with developmental differences in inhibitory control. Specifically, externalizing psychopathology was associated with decreased correct response rates and shorter latencies in early adolescence that appear to resolve into adulthood, perhaps through compensatory mechanisms acquired during adolescence. Neuroimaging data reveal high externalizing psychopathology was associated with developmentally-stable hypo-activation in prefrontal cortex and divergent development of posterior parietal cortex activation. Taken together, our data suggest that early adolescence may be a critical developmental period for prevention and intervention strategies addressing cognitive and phenotypic disinhibition. Nevertheless, further research examining multidimensional risk profiles in larger longitudinal datasets is needed to understand neurocognitive developmental mechanisms of problematic substance use onset and resilience across adolescence. Such a detailed understanding of neurodevelopmental factors of substance use vulnerability can clarify outcomes of adolescents with high-risk profiles and the etiology of early and escalating problematic substance use.

# Abstract
 
Adolescents strive for peer approval, and an increased sensitivity to peers’ opinions is normative. However, among vulnerable adolescents, peer evaluation can be detrimental, contributing to affective disorders. It is, therefore, critical to improve our understanding of neural underpinnings of peer evaluation. Prior research has investigated averaged neural responses to peer acceptance or rejection, neglecting to probe trial-by-trial computations that mirror real-time updating of daily activities. In non-social decision-making, a common neural valuation system centered on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has emerged, which evaluates different reward types on a common scale to guide choices. However, it is unclear whether the mPFC also tracks complex social scenarios involving peer feedback. To address this gap, we acquired fMRI data from 55 healthy adolescents during the Chatroom Task, which probes peer evaluation, and implemented a computational approach to characterize trial-by-trial social value, thereby allowing us to interrogate the neural correlates of social value. Consistent with our hypothesis, social value signals were encoded in the mPFC. Interestingly, analyses also revealed a wider social-specific valuation network including the precuneus and amygdala. Understanding how adolescents make social decisions and neural markers associated with it, may, ultimately, help us clarify promising targets for intervention.

## Introduction 
  
Adolescence is characterized by greater reliance on peer relationships and more autonomy from parents ( ). Although this is developmentally normative, the increased exposure to peer rejection, for some, may lead to the onset of mental disorders (including depression) and an increased risk of suicidal behaviors ( ;  ). Adolescence also is a critical period for brain development ( ), and thus, understanding the neural mechanisms that characterize social processes—particularly when adolescents are accepted or rejected by peers—may elucidate potential targets to guide future preventative interventions. 

A widely used experimental paradigm to probe neural correlates of peer evaluation is the Chatroom Task ( ;  ;  ). This ecologically valid task delivers peer feedback (i.e. acceptance versus rejection) within a simulated social context. Neuroimaging studies using this task have identified a wide network of brain regions engaged during processing of peer feedback that are relevant to depression and anxiety disorders, including the striatum, insula, amygdala and medial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC;  ;  ;  ). Specifically, among healthy adolescents, the striatum, thalamus and VLPFC were recruited more strongly during peer acceptance compared to rejection, whereas the amygdala, mPFC and insula were more strongly recruited during peer rejection relative to acceptance ( ;  ). Interestingly, relative to healthy adolescents, anxious and depressed adolescents showed increased amygdala, insula and mPFC activation, and mPFC–amygdala coupling during peer rejection ( ;  ;  ;  ). 

Although these studies have provided important insights, these analyses have relied on averaged neural responses to peer acceptance and rejection across trials, neglecting to probe critical trial-by-trial computations. A trial-level approach is important and can potentially provide more fine-grained information that sheds light on computational processes relevant to affective disorders. This is critical as, in daily life, we continuously update our preferences based on expected and unexpected outcomes. For example, if a peer acts in an untoward way, the reflexive response would be to update the value of this peer (e.g. act in a more cautious manner during the subsequent encounter). In this context, social processing involves continuously updating the value associated with social stimuli based on the discrepancy between the expected and predicted social outcomes (e.g. whether or not the person you expected to like reciprocated your feelings). As the Chatroom Task reliably probes brain regions involved with social computation, there is an opportunity to elucidate regions implicated in this social valuation process. 

During this task, participants initially select same-aged peers to chat with later in the study (i.e.   Initial Value  ). After a brief delay typically spanning 1–2 weeks, participants rate their expectation of peers’ interest in chatting with them (i.e.   Expected Value  ) and later receive explicit feedback from peers—they are either accepted or rejected—and then rate their subjective feeling after receiving the outcome (i.e.   Social Outcome  ). We expected that the discrepancy between the   Expected Value   and   Social Outcome   would lead to a social prediction error, which may then be used to update their   Initial Value   of the peer to obtain an updated   Social Value   for this peer. Utilizing this computational framework allows the computation of an individual’s social value on a trial-by-trial basis after every outcome and the identification of brain regions that compute and encode this value. This may, ultimately, improve our understanding of social processes in the context of peer evaluation. 

It has been proposed that social decisions may draw on a similar reinforcement learning framework as utilized during non-social decision making ( ). In this context, it has been proposed that a common neural valuation network exists ( ;  ), which evaluates different reward types on a common scale to guide choices ( ;  ). The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) forms the core of this network and is consistently shown to encode subjective value for different types of simple social (e.g. smile, praise) and non-social rewards [e.g. money, juice ( ;  )]. However, real-life social scenarios involve the integration of many potentially rewarding and aversive stimuli, and it is unclear whether there is a common neural valuation system that tracks these complex social scenarios (e.g. peer feedback). To address this gap, the study objective was to interrogate the neural correlates of social value during the Chatroom Task in healthy adolescents using a computational approach, involving trial-by-trial modulation of social value. Building on prior studies ( ;  ), we hypothesized that the mPFC would encode social value across healthy adolescents during the Chatroom Task. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Seventy healthy adolescents (45 females, 25 males) aged 12–14 years were recruited from the greater Boston area through online advertisements, posted flyers and direct mailings. Inclusion criteria included English fluency and right-handedness. Exclusion criteria included lifetime diagnosis of any psychopathology, mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, head injury resulting in loss of consciousness for 5 min or seizures. After exclusion due to motion and other structural abnormalities (see  ), the final sample considered for analyses included 55 adolescents (38 females, 17 males; age: 13 ± 0.82). 


### Procedure 
  
The Partners Institutional Review Board provided approval for the study. Adolescents assented, and a legal guardian provided informed written consent. Procedures were completed over two laboratory visits. In the first visit, adolescents were administered a diagnostic interview using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL;  ). K-SADS is a semi-structured interview assessing lifetime DSM-IV disorders in youth. In addition, participants completed the Phase 1 of the Chatroom Task. During the second visit, which occurred within 1–2 weeks (mean = 8.5 ± 6.9 days), participants completed Phase 2 of the Chatroom Task outside of the scanner, and Phase 3 was completed while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired. High-resolution structural MRI data also were also acquired to aid registration of functional images to MNI space. Participants were remunerated $80 ($40 for Day 1 and $40 for Day 2) for their participation. 


### Chatroom task 
  
The Chatroom Task ( ,  ;  ) was designed to simulate differential response to peer feedback (i.e. acceptance versus rejection). E-Prime (Psychological Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) software was used to present stimuli and record responses. This task was divided into three phases. In Phase 1, participants were led to believe they were participating in a nationwide study of how adolescents interact in online chatrooms. First, they created an online profile (i.e. indicating likes and dislikes) and then photographs of the participants were taken. Next, they viewed photographs of 60 same-aged female/male adolescents (corresponding to the gender of the participant) and selected 30 adolescents they were ‘interested’ and 30 adolescents they were ‘not interested’ in chatting with online following a neuroimaging scan 1–2 weeks later [Note: this was a categorical decision between not interested and interested options]. Participants were informed that female/male peers (corresponding to the gender of the participant) from collaborating institutions would review their profiles and indicate whether they were interested (i.e. peer acceptance) or not interested (i.e. peer rejection) in chatting online. Participants viewed pictures but not profiles of other adolescents. Photographs were equated on contrast and luminescence. Approximately 70% of photos were Caucasian and 30% were not Caucasian (i.e. Black, Hispanic, Asian, Mixed Race). Participants rated each photograph once.

Phase 2 and 3 occurred 1–2 weeks after completing Phase 1. For Phase 2, participants were shown the photographs they previously classified as ‘interested’ and ‘not interested’ and asked to rate, ‘How interested do you think s/he is in you?’ on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (not very interested) to 100 (very interested) prior to the fMRI acquisition. Phase 3 of the Chatroom Task was completed in the scanner, during which participants received peer feedback from the 60 female/male adolescents allegedly participating in the nationwide study while fMRI data were acquired. During each trial ( ), a participant viewed the photograph of a ‘participating female/male adolescent’ (1300 ms), and a photograph caption displaying ‘interested’ or ‘not interested’ was used to remind a participant about their prior selection. Then, a jittered fixation cross (1300–7600 ms) was presented, which was followed by the peer feedback superimposed under the photograph (2600 ms). After the feedback, a jittered fixation cross (1300–5200 ms) was displayed, and next a participant received a prompt, ‘  How does this make you feel?  ’ and was instructed to provide a rating on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (very bad) to 100 (very good). Feedback was provided in pseudorandom order with no more than three trials of the same feedback type provided consecutively. Unbeknownst to the participants, feedback was fixed, as all participants received the same number of acceptance (30 interested trials) and rejection (30 not interested trials) trials. Participants utilized the button box to rate their feedback on a visual analogue scale presented on the presentation computer. After completing the Chatroom Task, participants were debriefed.

### Computational model of social value 
  
Learning occurs when there is a discrepancy between expected and actual outcome, leading to a prediction error (PE). The value of the stimuli is then updated using this PE, explained by the following equation: 

Computation of social value is straightforward in our paradigm, as all participants specify each of their subjective ratings. This provides the opportunity to compute social value and investigate brain regions that encode this value. First, participants’ initial selection on whether they will be interested in chatting with the peers was represented as   V   (  Initial Value  ), with ‘not interested’ coded as 0 and ‘interested’ coded as 100 (i.e. Phase 1). Next, during Phase 2, participants rated their expectation on how interested peers would be in chatting with them on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (  not very interested  ) to 100 (  very interested  ), which reflected their   Expected Value   (EV). Finally, when participants were in the scanner, they received explicit feedback and rated how this feedback made them feel on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (  very bad  ) to 100 (  very good  ), which represented the   Social Outcome   (O; modulated by individuals’ social sensitivity; i.e. Phase 3). Average Subjective ratings and model derived Social Value during the task are reported in  . 


### Imaging data acquisition 
  
Functional MRI data were acquired at the McLean Imaging Center on a Siemens Tim Trio 3 Tesla MR scanner using a 32-channel head coil. For functional scans, data were acquired in an interleaved fashion using T2*-weighted gradient echo planer images (EPIs), with the following parameters TR/TE: 1300/32.2 ms; FOV: 212 mm; echo spacing = 0.69 ms; matrix: 64 × 64; 72 slices; in-plane resolution: 2 mm; flip angle = 66°; voxels 2 × 2 ×2 mm; multiband factor = 8. A multiecho MPRAGE T1 structural image was acquired with the following parameters: TR: 2200 ms; TE1/TE2/TE3/TE4: 1.54/3.36/5.18/7 ms; voxel size: 1.2 × 1.2 × 1.2 mm; 144 slices. A field map was also acquired to correct for distortions with the following parameters: TR: 1000 ms; TE1/TE2: 10/12.46 ms; voxel size: 3.5 × 1.8 × 2.5 mm; 51 slices. 


### Imaging data pre-processing 
  
Functional MRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12;  ). Based on visual inspection of hardware-related artifacts in the raw images, two participants were excluded due to poor quality and were not processed further. For the remaining 68 participants’ scans, distortion correction was applied using field maps acquired in the task session. Functional images were then realigned to the mean image of the series, corrected for motion and slice timing-related artifacts, co-registered with the anatomical image, normalized to the 2 × 2 × 2 mm MNI template and smoothed with a 4 mm Gaussian kernel. A two-step procedure was utilized to account for motion correction. First, participants who had extensive movement (>4 mm or 4° rotation from the reference first volume) throughout the task were excluded (  n   = 5). Second, for participants who had extensive movement only in the later part of the task, to increase the study power, only the first portion of these trials that was devoid of extensive movement were included and the latter part was excluded (e.g. first 60%, 72%, 99%, 42%, 90% trials from the entire task were included for 5 of the 63 adolescents). Then, the Artifact Detection Toolbox (ART) was used to identify outlier scans in global signal (>±9 SD) and movement (>2 mm of movement or 2° of rotation from the previous volume). Participants with more than 7% trials excluded by ART were excluded from the analyses (  n   = 8). These outlier trials identified by ART were distributed throughout the task, unlike the extensive movement observed only in the first part of the task of the above participants. Mean percent of trials removed by ART for the remaining participants was 2.25 ± 1.7%. The final sample included 55 adolescents (17 males and 38 females). 


### Statistical analyses 
  
First-level general linear model included six unmodulated regressors, corresponding to onset times of each event (cue, anticipation, feedback, post-feedback ISI and feedback rating) with a boxcar function spanning the entire duration of each event. To investigate brain regions that encoded the trial-by-trial computations of social value signals during the Chatroom Task, we parametrically modulated model-derived social values (Vnew) with a post-feedback ISI unmodulated regressor and convolved with a hemodynamic response function. The covariates of no interest included inter-trial interval, ART regressors, six motion realignment parameters and a constant term modeling the baseline of unchanged neural activation. For each participant, the linear coefficients of social value regressor were compared to 0 and the resulting contrast images were taken to conduct one sample   t   test to identify brain regions that encode social value. To test the temporal specificity of these social value signals, we parametrically modulated model-derived social values (Vnew) with a feedback rating unmodulated regressor in a separate general linear model.

## Results 
  
### Sample characteristics 
  
The final sample for the fMRI analyses included 55 adolescents (38 females, 17 males), aged 12–14 years (13.00 ± 0.82). Participants endorsed the following races: 85.5% White, 5.5% Asian, 3.6% Black or African American and 5.5% multiple races. The family’s income distribution included the following: 54.5% = more than $100 000, 18.2% = $75 000 to $100 000, 9.1% = $50 000 to $75 000 and 18.2% = not reported. These are summarized in  . 


### Chatroom behavioral data 
  
To determine whether the task manipulation was believable, at the end of the session, the experimenter asked a series of questions that participants rated on a scale from 1 to 10 (higher scores reflect more positive responses for questions 1 and 2, but more negative responses for questions 3, 4 and 5; all were significantly different than zero,   P   < 0.001): (1) ‘  How interested were you in this task?  ’ (6.46 ± 2.23); (2) ‘  How happy were you when someone expressed interest in chatting with you?  ’ (7.78 ± 1.76); (3) ‘  How upset were you when someone rejected you?  ’ (4.4 ± 1.97); (4) ‘  How angry were you when someone rejected you?  ’ (2.9 ± 1.82); and (5) ‘  How nervous did you feel while waiting for the other person to make their choice?  ’ (4.25 ± 2.49). Outlier criterion was defined as ±3 SD on any item response; no participant data were removed based on these criteria. Collectively, these ratings indicate that the task elicited the intended effects, and all participants were effectively deceived by the task manipulation. 


### Whole brain analyses 
  
Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed social value signals encoded in the mPFC (peak voxel: −2, 44, −6;   z   = 5.36; cluster size: 458). In addition, social value signals were observed in regions associated with social processing, including the left amygdala (peak voxel: −14, −6, −20;   z   = 4.99; cluster size: 61) and left precuneus (peak voxel: −6, −56, 8;   z   = 4.16; cluster size: 168). Two other regions that encoded social value were the right lingual gyrus (peak voxel: 12, −78, −4; z = 4.37; cluster size: 62) and left fusiform gyrus (peak voxel: −48, −76, −4;   z   = 3.96; cluster size: 132). All clusters were   P   < 0.05 FWE cluster-corrected (with initial cluster forming threshold of   P   < 0.001;  ;  , A). 

#### Temporal specificity of social value signals 
  
To test the temporal specificity of social value signals, we modeled them at the time of feedback rating in a separate general linear model. However, we did not find value signals to be encoded in any of the regions except the lingual gyrus (peak voxel: 10, −78, −2;   z   = 4.96; cluster size: 69;  , B) during feedback rating. This suggests that the computation of social value occurs immediately after the feedback outcome. 


#### Exploratory analysis evaluating sex differences in social value encoding 
  
Mounting evidence suggests that females perceive and process social information differently than males ( ;  ). To explore sex differences, we extracted beta weights from the five clusters (mPFC, precuneous, amygdala, lingual and fusiform gyrus). Social value encoding in the fusiform and lingual gyri did not differ between boys and girls. However, in regions specific to social computation (mPFC, precuneus and left amygdala), girls exhibited greater social value encoding than boys (all   P   < 0.05; mPFC—  t  (53) = 2.55;   P   = 0.014;   d   = 0.74, amygdala—  t  (53) = 2.79;   P   = 0.007;   d   = 0.81, precuneus—  t  (53) = 2.22;   P   = 0.03;   d   = 0.65). 




## Discussion 
  
Navigating peer relationships is critical during adolescence. In this study, we investigated the neural correlates of the social valuation network in healthy adolescents using an ecologically valid peer evaluation paradigm. Unlike prior studies in this area ( ;  ), trial-by-trial social values were calculated based on the individuals’ selection of peers, expectation of peers’ interest in chatting with them and their subjective feeling after the outcome that signaled peers’ interests in them. Consistent with the ‘common neural currency’ theory ( ), and our hypothesis, whole-brain analyses revealed that these social value signals were encoded in the mPFC across all individuals. Interestingly, our analyses also revealed a wider social-specific valuation network that included the precuneus cortex and amygdala. 

Prior studies that have utilized this paradigm have investigated the average neural activation during peer acceptance and rejection, but have not capitalized on the trial-by-trial computations that occur during peer evaluation [Note: Average neural responses to peer acceptance vs rejection were consistent with prior research ( ), thereby validating the task, see  ]. In addition, most studies often focus only on ‘interested peers’ trials, thereby neglecting a potentially valuable component of the task. Using a computational framework, we were able to identify brain regions that track social value parameters, providing insight into the neurobiology of social choice behavior. In addition, it enabled us to compare complex social behavior with other social and non-social decision-making. 

There is a robust consensus that the mPFC plays a critical role in the dynamic computation of values associated with both primary (e.g. food) and secondary (e.g. monetary) non-social stimuli ( ;  ). However, whether the valuation of social outcomes or social rewards relies on the mPFC is a subject of ongoing investigations. There is some support for the involvement of the mPFC in processing socially relevant information. For instance, representation of the self and others ( ), cooperative human partners ( ) and mentalizing ( ) recruit the mPFC. Similarly, lesion studies in non-human primates have shown that this region is critical for establishing social interest in other individual macaques ( ). Complementing these findings, mPFC activation has been found to correlate with individuals’ propensity to pay more money to view an attractive face ( ). Partially supporting a shared valuation system, self-reported ratings of facial attractiveness were encoded in the mPFC, suggesting that the subjective reward value of social stimuli may be coded similarly to primary and secondary rewards ( ). This would suggest that the brain maps these different reward types on a common scale to guide choices ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Consistent with this assumption, recent meta-analyses have highlighted overlapping value encoding for both simple social (e.g. attractiveness, praise, smile) and non-social rewards (e.g. money, juice) in the mPFC (Chase, Kumar, Eickhoff, & Dombrovski, 2015;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, findings have extended to more complex social rewards, including during collaborative decision-making ( ) and intention to trust a partner during economic exchange games ( ). Our results add to this body of research, suggesting that updating of social value associated with peer evaluations also recruits the mPFC. Even though our task did not have a learning component, our results suggest that computation of these social values might drive behavioral change during social decision-making recruiting regions similar to the non-social reinforcement learning circuitry. 

Apart from the mPFC, social value signals also were encoded in other socially relevant brain regions including the amygdala and precuneus cortex. It is possible that during social decision-making, the mPFC communicates with higher level social processing regions to encode social perception. Even though we did not hypothesize social value to be encoded in the amygdala and precuneus, it is not surprising that these regions encode social value, considering their involvement in processing social stimuli ( ). In addition, aberrant (increased) amygdala function to social feedback has been associated with both adult and adolescent anxiety and depressive disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ). In contrast, the precuneus is thought to support mentalizing processes, facilitating an individual’s ability to comprehend or interpret other people’s thoughts, feelings and intentions ( ;  ). The precuneus also might contribute to self-referential processing ( ) and, similar to our findings, has been implicated in social rejection and exclusion ( ). Further supporting the idea that these regions contribute to computation of subjective value for social rewards,   showed that connectivity between the mPFC and a network of regions including the amygdala and precuneus predicted individual differences in valuation to social rewards. Interestingly, these regions represent dominant hubs of the default mode network (DMN), which are thought to be activated largely at ‘rest’. However, the DMN also was active during tasks that require participants to understand and interact with others, and interpreting self and others’ emotional status, suggesting a substantial overlap between the brain regions typically involved in social cognitive processes and the default system ( ). Other brain region that was observed to encode these social value signals was the fusiform gyrus. Although reward-related responses in the fusiform gyrus have been identified ( ;  ), this study argued that these signals may reflect attentional processing rather than reward processing   per se   ( ). 

Mounting evidence suggests that females perceive and process social information differently than males ( ;  ). In addition, central for our study, girls have been shown to exhibit increased sensitivity to social rejection ( ). Consistent with this finding, we found girls to have an increased social value signaling in the mPFC, amygdala and precuneus. This was observed despite girls and boys perceiving peer feedback similarly (boys and girls did not differ in the task manipulation questionnaire scores that rated on their subjective feelings during the task). This is interesting, as some studies have demonstrated increased sensitivity to the interpersonal stressors in girls, but achievement stressors in boys ( ). Whether sex-specific neural responses to peer evaluation might index differential risk for adolescent depression is an important question for future studies. Specifically, previous research has shown increased neural responses to peer rejection to be associated with both current adolescent depression ( ) and future risk for depressive symptoms. The present results suggest that girls are more attuned to social evaluation, giving more importance to social feedback when compared with boys, and recruit more strongly regions critically implicated in computation of social value (mPFC, precuneus and left amygdala). It is possible that this increased social value encoding in girls might be a risk factor of future depression if efficient adaptation of these events is not achieved. However, caution is warranted, as these analyses were exploratory in nature and included uneven groups. It is, therefore, crucial for future research to investigate the longitudinal neural markers of peer evaluation in girls and boys and identify interventions to overcome the negative effects of these interpersonal stressors. 


## Limitations 
  
Four limitations warrant attention. First, the modest ethnic distribution within this sample limits the generalizability of the findings. Second, the age range was restricted to 12 to 14 years old in order to reduce putative age-related effects. However, this restricted range may also limit the generalizability of these findings to younger or older youth. Third, the percent of excluded participants (21%) on the basis of gross motion is slightly higher compared to other studies. However, this is not surprising, as head motion is a significant concern for pediatric compared to adult imaging, and age is shown to inversely correlate with head motion ( ). Last, our task design allowed us to probe value computations occurring at every trial (even though a given trial does not influence the next one) and thereby identify brain regions that encode these computations. It does not, however, allow us to probe how computations in one trial might influence future responses in subsequent trials. However, we believe that our approach paves the way for future studies utilizing computational models on tasks that explicitly compute and predict trial-by-trial social values. 


## Conclusions 
  
Our findings highlight a common neural currency valuation region (mPFC) that is involved in social decision-making, along with a social-specific core (amygdala and precuneus). Social rewards can provide gateways towards learning about others, building personal social networks, and establishing close relationships. Understanding how we make social decisions and neural markers associated with it will help us navigate promising avenues for intervention.

Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) enables noninvasive targeted intervention in brain activation with high spatial specificity. To achieve this promise of rtfMRI-nf, we introduced and demonstrated a data-driven framework to design a rtfMRI-nf intervention through the discovery of precise target location associated with clinical symptoms and neurofeedback signal optimization. Specifically, we identified the functional connectivity locus associated with rumination symptoms, utilizing a connectome-wide search in resting-state fMRI data from a large cohort of mood and anxiety disorder individuals (  N   = 223) and healthy controls (  N   = 45). Then, we performed a rtfMRI simulation analysis to optimize the online functional connectivity neurofeedback signal for the identified functional connectivity. The connectome-wide search was performed in the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus brain regions to identify the precise location of the functional connectivity associated with rumination severity as measured by the ruminative response style (RRS) scale. The analysis found that the functional connectivity between the loci in the precuneus (-6, −54, 48 mm in MNI) and the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ; 49, −49, 23 mm) was positively correlated with RRS scores (depressive,   p   < 0.001; brooding,   p   < 0.001; reflective,   p   = 0.002) in the mood and anxiety disorder group. We then performed a rtfMRI processing simulation to optimize the online computation of the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity. We determined that the two-point method without a control region was appropriate as a functional connectivity neurofeedback signal with less dependence on signal history and its accommodation of head motion. The present study offers a discovery framework for the precise location of functional connectivity targets for rtfMRI-nf intervention, which could help directly translate neuroimaging findings into clinical rtfMRI-nf interventions. 
 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
Neurofeedback is a noninvasive technique of intervening in human brain activity ( ). In neurofeedback training, a feedback signal of on-going brain activation is presented to participants to help them self-regulate their brain activity through learning to modulate the signal. A promising application of this intervention is a clinical treatment of psychiatric disorders via normalization of abnormal brain activation as a result of the training ( ;  ;  ). Designing a neurofeedback protocol involves the identification of the target brain activation associated with a disorder symptom. In this regard, real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) has a distinct advantage over other neurofeedback modalities, such as electroencephalography and/or near-infrared spectroscopy, in localizing a target region anywhere in the brain with high spatial resolution. fMRI is also the most popular neuroimaging method for mapping human brain function as well as altered function in a disease state. RtfMRI-nf can take advantage of the results of such fMRI functional mapping studies to determine the intervention target. The activation measure of rtfMRI-nf can either be activity at a specific region of interest (ROI), functional connectivity between regions, or a pattern of multiple regions’ activity ( ). Thus, with its high spatial specificity and broad applicability of functional measurement, rtfMRI-nf can be a direct way of translating neuroscience knowledge into a clinical intervention. 

In designing a rtfMRI-nf treatment protocol, abnormal brain activity associated with a disorder symptom is determined as a neurofeedback target, with the assumption that normalizing an abnormal brain activation could alleviate disorder symptoms. Two major approaches have been used for neurofeedback target determination ( ). One approach involves referring to previous research characterizing disease-specific abnormal brain responses to identify a specific anatomical location associated with the disease. RtfMRI-nf can take advantage of the outcomes of abundant neuroimaging research, including systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis studies, to identify the neurofeedback target. This approach, however, cannot fully utilize the high spatial specificity of rtfMRI-nf. The result of a systematic review that summarizes studies with different specific aims based on a region name of atlas-based nomenclature does not indicate the exact location of abnormal brain activation. While quantitative meta-analysis, such as activation likelihood estimation (ALE) ( ), can indicate a coordinate of the region involved in the disease, meta-analysis usually includes studies with broadly different aims or tasks. Thus, the identified locus may not be the region of specific functional abnormality but an overlap of blurred activation maps for different functions. 

Another approach to identifying the rtfMRI-nf target is a functional localizer scan ( ;  ). This approach performs a task that can elucidate a specific functional abnormality in fMRI and finds a locus of abnormal brain activation for each participant. This approach has a significant advantage in pinpointing the personalized target location, and researchers can fully take advantage of the high-spatial specificity of rtfMRI-nf. However, it is not always possible to fully utilize this approach since not all diseases have an established localizer task to identify abnormalities, and some tasks may not be applicable to patients with severe symptoms. For example, showing negative pictures repetitively to depressed patients could be harmful to their mood and possibly worsen their symptoms. Also, if the abnormality is expressed as a non-activation, we cannot locate the position of abnormality with a localizer scan ( ). 

The present study introduced an alternative approach for data-driven and process-based neurofeedback target identification based on big data of resting-state fMRI, specifically for functional connectivity rtfMRI-nf. The data-driven approach can identify the exact location of abnormal brain activation by analyzing the original data, which is not performed in review or meta-analysis studies. Although the approach based on population data cannot personalize the target location like the functional localizer, it can identify the location with a non-active or low-connectivity abnormality through a comparison between disease and control groups. In addition, a resting-state fMRI scan is applicable to any patient population and could indicate an abnormality as a therapeutic target ( ). 

Furthermore, if the dataset for identifying the target includes samples with a wide range of symptom spectrum measures across diagnostic groups, we can identify the locus of brain activation associated with symptom dimension. As the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework highlighted ( ;  ), current diagnostic systems for mental disorders are not based on neurobiological alterations, and the connection between diagnosis and underlaying neurobiology has not been established. The rtfMRI-nf intervention cannot be a full-fledged clinical treatment with such uncertainty and variability of neurobiological abnormality. A process-based framework of rtfMRI-nf ( ) has been proposed for precise intervention to accommodate such neurobiological variability in a diagnostic group. This framework identifies the neurofeedback target associated with a specific functional process of pathological abnormality instead of the average difference between disease and control groups. The data-driven approach can identify such a process-based target via direct access to the original data. A functional localizer cannot identify the locus associated with dimensional abnormality because the abnormality can be characterized only with a distribution of population data, not with one individual data point. Taken together, the data-driven process-based approach could be an optimal way to identify a neurofeedback target to make good use of the advantage of rtfMRI-nf. 

To establish this approach, we need a dataset with large sample size, including a range of diagnostic groups and comprehensive measures of functional dimensions. The Tulsa 1000 study provides the ideal dataset for this purpose ( ). The dataset includes both healthy participants and those with a psychiatric diagnosis with comprehensive measurements of biological and behavioral assessment, including fMRI and symptom scales. Using this dataset, the present study aimed to identify the functional connectivity locus associated with a specific symptom, rumination in mood and anxiety disorder participants, as a target of future rtfMRI-nf intervention. 

Rumination has been defined as “the process of thinking perseveratively about one's feelings and problems rather than in terms of the specific content of thoughts” ( ). Rumination and associated repetitive negative thinking are a pervasive symptom observed in multiple psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, obsessive-compulsive disorder, binge eating, and self-injurious behavior ( ;  ). Ruminative response style to a traumatic event also mediates the development of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms ( ). Rumination could exacerbate depression symptoms by enhancing the effect of depressed mood with repetitive thinking of negative thoughts and by interfering with problem solving ( ). Ruminative response style is also a predictive factor of major depressive episodes ( ). These indicate that rumination is a promising target for treatment to alleviate disorder symptoms as well as prevent symptom development across diagnoses. Indeed, cognitive behavioral therapies targeting rumination showed an effect of decreasing depressive symptoms ( ;  ;  ). 

Neurobiologically, cortical midline structures ( ;  ) involved in the default mode network (DMN) have been implicated in rumination and associated self-referential thinking ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ). Specifically, two core parts of the structure, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/Prec) regions have been implicated in self-referential processing as well as pathological rumination due to their abnormal activity ( ;  ;  ) and altered functional connectivity ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). 

The current study searched for the precise locus of functional connectivity associated with rumination symptom severity for mood and anxiety disorder patients. The brain areas involved in this search included the MPFC and PCC/Prec regions. While studies indicate that functional connectivity in either the MPFC or PCC/Prec was associated with rumination, most of the studies used an   a priori  -defined seed region based on an anatomical atlas and did not perform a voxel-wise search for the seed and its connectivity. As these areas are not functionally homogeneous ( ;  ;  ), an   a priori   definition of the seed ROI could misidentify the precise location of the connectivity associated with rumination symptom. While   and   examined voxel-wise resting-state functional connectivity to find altered connectivity in participants with major depressive disorder compared to controls, they did not search for and determine connectivity correlated with rumination symptom severity. They, instead, searched the connectivity with group difference and evaluated a correlation with rumination in a post-hoc analysis. Thus, the precise locus of functional connectivity associated with rumination severity that can serve as a neurofeedback target with high-spatial specificity has not yet been identified. 

To identify the precise location of the functional connectivity associated with rumination severity, the present study performed a connectome-wide association analysis ( ;  ). The connectome-wide analysis investigates comprehensive voxel-wise connectivity associations ( ) utilizing multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR) analysis ( ). This analysis examines voxel-wise connectivity association without   a priori   seed definition. We performed MDMR for resting-state fMRI data in the Tulsa 1000 study dataset with a regressor of rumination symptoms derived from the Ruminative Response Styles (RRS) scale ( ). We supposed that this analysis could enable us to identify the locus of functional connectivity significantly associated with rumination severity in mood and anxiety disorders, which can serve as a rtfMRI-nf target. 

Additionally, we performed a simulation analysis to design an optimal real-time neurofeedback signal, following a framework introduced by  . This optimization with simulation is an additional benefit of accessing original data when designing a rtfMRI-nf treatment protocol. The simulation analysis was performed for the functional connectivity identified in the connectome-wide analysis described above. Two measures of online functional connectivity, sliding-window correlation and the two-point algorithm ( ), were evaluated. Through a data-driven search for the precise location of connectivity associated with rumination severity and optimization of a connectivity-based neurofeedback signal, we introduced and demonstrated a data-driven, process-based framework of designing a rtfMRI-nf treatment protocol with precise targeting and an optimally designed neurofeedback signal. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Data 
  
Data of 268 participants including a mood and/or anxiety disorder group (MA;   N   = 223, 162 females, mean (SD) age = 36 (11) years, 147 participants were medicated) and a healthy control group (HC;   N   = 45, 23 females, mean (SD) age = 32 (11) years) from the Tulsa 1000 study ( ) were used in the analysis. Of the note, the participants were selected from the first 500 subjects (exploratory dataset out of 1000 subjects study cohort) of Tulsa 10,000 study. The diagnosis was based on an abbreviated version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI V.6.0) ( ). MA group includes participants with either mood disorder symptoms, anxiety disorder symptoms, or both with MINI. While the majority of their primary diagnoses were major depressive disorder or general anxiety disorder, they also included comorbidity of social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and alcohol dependence. We included these diagnostically heterogeneous populations following a trans-diagnostic approach of RDoC to search for a neurobiological basis of the specific symptom dimension, rumination. 

Rumination was evaluated with the Ruminative Response Styles (RRS) scale ( ). The total score of RRS as well as its sub-scores of depressive, brooding, and reflective rumination ( ) were used as a regressor for resting-state functional connectivity patterns in the MDMR analysis. Rumination is a multidimensional construct and its depressive and brooding components are considered maladaptive processes associated with disorder symptoms, while its reflective component could be an adaptive process ( ). Hence, the neuropathology associated with depressive and brooding rumination could be a target of intervention. We also used the depression and anxiety scales in the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) ( ) to examine their effects on the connectivity pattern. The MDMR analysis was performed independently for each symptom scale. 

Resting-state fMRI data were collected on a whole-body 3 Tesla MR750 MRI scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) with an 8-channel receive-only head array coil at the Laureate Institute of Brain Research. Participants were instructed not to move and to relax and rest while looking at a cross on the screen during an 8-min resting-state scan. A single-shot gradient-recalled echo-planner imaging (EPI) sequence with sensitivity encoding (SENSE) was used with imaging parameters of TR/TE = 2000/27 ms, FA = 78°, FOV = 240 mm, 39 axial slices with 2.9 mm thickness without gap, matrix = 96×96, SENSE acceleration factor   R   = 2, sampling bandwidth = 250 kHz. The EPI images were reconstructed into a 128 × 128 matrix resulting in 1.875 × 1.875 × 2.9 mm  voxel volume. For anatomical reference, T1-weighted MRI images with a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence with parameters of FOV = 240 × 190 mm, matrix = 256 × 256, 120 axial slices, slice thickness = 0.9 mm, 0.9375 × 0.9375 × 0.9 mm  voxel volume, TR/TE = 5/2 ms, SENSE acceleration   R   = 2, flip angle = 8°, delay/inversion time TD/TI = 1400/725 ms, sampling bandwidth = 31.2 kHz, scan time = 5 min 40 s, were also acquired. 


### Connectome-wide association analysis 
  
Preprocessing of functional images was performed with Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) ( ). The initial five volumes were excluded from the analysis. The preprocessing included despiking, RETROICOR ( ) and RVT ( ) physiological noise corrections, slice-timing correction, motion corrections, nonlinear warping to the MNI template brain with resampling to 2 mm  voxels using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) ( ) ( ), smoothing with 6mm-FWHM kernel, and scaling to percent change relative to the mean signal in each voxel. General linear model (GLM) analysis was performed with regressors of 12 motion parameters (three rotations, three shifts, and their temporal derivatives), three principal components of ventricle signals, local white matter average signals (ANATICOR ( )), 4th-order Legendre polynomials for high-pass filtering, and censoring TRs with large head motion (> 0.25 mm frame-wise displacement). Voxel-wise residual signals of the GLM were used for the connectome-wide analysis. 

Connectome-wide investigation was performed in two steps; identification of the seed area with MDMR and a post-hoc traditional seed-based analysis for the identified seed. The first step examined the association between whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) from a seed voxel and a symptom scale using MDMR analysis ( ;  ). We followed the procedure described in detail in  , and scripts for the analysis are available at GitHub ( ). Briefly, the processed resting-state fMRI images were down-sampled to 4mm  voxels, and then the voxels in gray matter regions were extracted. A connectivity map (z-transformed Pearson correlation) was made from each voxel to all other voxels. The dependent variable of MDMR is a distance matrix of the connectivity maps between participants. The distance of the maps was calculated with Euclidean distance of the connectivity maps. The MDMR analysis evaluates the association between the distance matrix and the predictor variables with a linear model. The model includes a symptom score, group (MA/HC), and their interaction, as well as gender, medication status, age, and motion (mean frame-wise displacement) as covariates. The result of MDMR was represented with an   F   value that was the ratio of the variance explained by a certain regressor relative to the residual variance ( ;  ). A permutation test was performed to test the significance of the statistic, in which regressors of interest (symptom score, group, and their interaction) were orthogonalized with regard to nuisance regressors, and then the orthogonalized regressors of interest were randomly permuted ( ). Ten thousand random permutations were performed. 

These procedures were repeated for individual voxels within the MPFC and PCC/Prec regions. The MPFC and PPC/Prec region masks were extracted from the DMN map obtained from 405 healthy participants' resting-state fMRI data ( ) provided at  . One cluster in the MPFC and four clusters in the PCC and the precuneus in the DMN were used as the MPFC and PCC/Prec masks, respectively ( A). The MDMR analysis was performed for the MPFC and PCC/Prec regions, separately. The MDMR statistical map was thresholded with voxel-wise   p   < 0.005 and cluster-size corrected   p   < 0.05.

The MDMR statistical parametric map indicates how much the whole-brain connectivity pattern for a voxel was associated with rumination symptom severity. From MDMR analysis, we used the significant regions as the seed of the following seed-based connectivity analysis. We note that while the seed search with MDMR was performed within the MPFC and PCC/Prec masks, connectivity from a seed was evaluated in the whole brain region. Therefore, the analysis covered the whole brain connectivity that originated from the MPFC and PCC/Prec seed regions. 

The second step was a seed-based connectivity analysis for the discovered significant regions of the MDMR statistical map. The analysis was done for the original resolution functional images. The seed region (6mm-radius sphere) was placed at a peak location of significant clusters in the MDMR statistical map. The average signal time-course of the seed area was used as a reference signal to calculate correlations with other voxels in the whole brain. Fisher's   z  -transformation was applied to the correlation coefficient to make a connectivity map for each participant. Then, as a second-level group analysis, voxel-wise linear model analysis was applied to the connectivity maps with the same design matrix as the MDMR. The statistical map was thresholded with voxel-wise   p   < 0.001 and cluster-size correction of   p   < 0.05. The cluster-size threshold was evaluated with 3dClustSim in AFNI using a spatial autocorrelation function model ( ). 

Limiting the search area of MDMR helps increase the sensitivity of the analysis because the estimation of the null distribution derived from the permutation test used for family-wise error correction could be optimized for each region. This sensitivity improvement could be critical for the discovery because the sensitivity of MDMR analysis is lower than a seed-based analysis ( ). 


### Simulation of online functional connectivity neurofeedback signal 
  
To design an optimal neurofeedback signal for the identified FC associated with an RRS score, we performed a simulation to calculate an online real-time FC feedback signal. Here, two methods of online connectivity neurofeedback signal, sliding-window correlation ( ) and the two-point algorithm ( ), were evaluated. The sliding-window correlation is a   z  -transformed Pearson correlation between ROIs within a time window. Widths of a three- to ten-time points window were evaluated in the simulation. The window was moved at each TR to calculate the online feedback signal. The two-point algorithm uses the directionality of the signal change between the regions to evaluate their connectivity. The feedback signal is calculated as a binary value; e.g., when a participant is trained to increase the connectivity, positive feedback (+1) is given if the two regions have the same change direction (e.g., an increase or decrease); otherwise, no feedback (0) is given. The original introduction of the two-point method ( ) used a control ROI to cancel a signal change unspecific to the target connectivity. With the control ROI, positive feedback is given when the two target regions have the same change direction as well as that is different from the direction in the control region. Both versions of the two-point method, with and without the control ROI, were evaluated in the simulation. 

Feedback signals of these online functional connectivity measures were calculated in a real-time fMRI processing simulation for the resting-state fMRI data used in the connectome-wide analysis. The simulation was performed on an advanced real-time fMRI data processing system implementing comprehensive online noise reduction processes ( ;  ). The system performed slice-timing correction, motion correction, spatial smoothing, signal scaling, and GLM with regressors of high-pass filtering, six motion parameters, mean white matter signal, mean ventricle signal, and RETROICOR ( ) in real-time online processing. This system enabled us to obtain a cleaned online fMRI signal in real-time. The online FC was calculated for this online processed signal. 

The optimality of online FC was evaluated with regard to three criteria, correlation with FC obtained from offline analysis, robustness to head motion, and timeliness of neurofeedback. Since the identified FC in the connectome-wide analysis had a significant association with rumination severity in the offline FC (correlation with whole time-course signals), an online FC that had a high correlation with the offline FC should be a better neurofeedback signal. Correlation between the offline FC and the average online FC neurofeedback signal time-course was calculated for this evaluation. Robustness to the head motion's artifact was evaluated with the correlation between the time-course of the online FC neurofeedback signal and the time-course of the mean frame-wise displacement within the window of online connectivity calculation. For the two-point method, the window was defined by the current and the previous time points. The timeliness of the online FC was determined by its dependence on the signal history. Dependence on history is large for methods with more time points; thus, a short-width sliding-window or the two-point method are preferred in this regard.

 shows the demographic and symptom profile of the Tulsa 1000 participants used for this analysis. There was no significant difference in age between the groups. Symptom scales of rumination, depression, and anxiety were significantly higher for MA than HC. All the sub-scales of RRS were also significantly higher for MA than HC.

  Table 1     

a shows the masks for the MPFC and PCC/Prec regions, where the MDMR analysis was performed. A significant association between a symptom scale and the FC was found for reflective RRS and depressive RRS in the MDMR analysis. Specifically, a significant   F   value of the MDMR analysis for the effect of reflective RRS was found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, x, y,   z   = −2, 30, 24 mm in MNI) in the MPFC ( b). A significant effect of the group by depressive RRS interaction was found in the left precuneus (−6, −54, 48 mm in MNI) in the PCC/Prec ( c). No other symptoms and their interaction with the group showed a significant effect on the connectivity pattern in the MDMR analysis. Post-hoc seed-based connectivity analysis was performed for the peak locations of the significant MDMR results. 

The second step post-hoc analysis for the ACC seed connectivity revealed a significant effect of reflective RRS ( ) at the bilateral fusiform and inferior temporal area, the bilateral middle frontal region, the left middle cingulate region, the left medial frontal region, the right precuneus, the right temporal pole, the right thalamus, and the right calcarine region. Peak coordinates of the significant clusters are shown in  . The connectivity between the ACC and these regions was positively correlated with reflective RRS.

The second step post-hoc analysis for the effect of depressive RRS on the precuneus connectivity was performed for each of the HC and MA groups to resolve the significant interaction effect on the precuneus connectivity. As the aim of this study was to identify the connectivity associated with pathological rumination, and the variance of RRS within HC was not large, we focused on the MA group here. A result of the HC group is shown in supplementary materials (supplementary figure 1 and table S1).   shows the regions with the precuneus connectivity significantly associated with depressive RRS for MA. The MA group had a significant association between depressive RRS and the precuneus connectivity at the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ, x, y,   z   = 49, −49, 23 mm in MNI) area and the left intraparietal sulcus (LIPS, −37, −57, 53 mm) region. Connectivity between the precuneus and these regions was positively correlated with depressive RRS in MA.

  Fig 3   

These results indicated that pathological rumination in MA was associated with the precuneus connectivity with the right TPJ and the left IPS regions. We further examined the association with other RRS subscales as well as the effect of gender and medication status on these connectivities.   shows associations between the precuneus connectivity and RRS subscales for the RTPJ and the LIPS regions. Connectivity (  z  -transformed Pearson correlation) was calculated between the mean signals of a 6-mm-radius sphere ROI centered at the peak locations. The RTPJ connectivity with the precuneus had significant associations with all RRS subscales in the MA group. LIPS connectivity with the precuneus had a significant association only with depressive RRS in MA. No significant effect of gender was found on either connectivity when the interaction of gender by depressive RRS was added in the analysis. When the interaction of medication status by depressive RRS was added in the analysis, a significant interaction effect of medication by depressive RRS was observed for the RTPJ connectivity (  F   = 4.663,   p   = 0.031). This effect was driven by the larger association in unmedicated (  t   = 4.189,   p   < 0.001) than medicated participants (  t   = 1.986,   p   = 0.048). No significant interaction effect of the medication on depressive RRS was found for the LIPS connectivity (  F   = 0.382,   p   = 0.537). Considering that all RRS subscales were significantly higher for MA than HC ( ), these results suggest that the precuneus connectivity with the RTPJ could be more strongly associated with the severity of rumination symptoms in MA disorder than with the LIPS.

Fitted lines and their 95% confidence intervals for HC and MA are also shown.   t   and   p   values indicate the significance of the linear association between RRS and connectivity for each group.

We also examined the robustness of the post-hoc result with a split-data validation analysis. The analysis was performed for the MA group with the precuneus seed identified by the MDMR analysis. The MA participants were randomly divided into two sets (  N   = 112 and 113), and the seed-based connectivity analysis was performed for each set independently with the same procedure as above. While the significant effect was seen only with a less stringent threshold (voxel-wise   p   < 0.005) in either set, RTPJ was the only cluster that was overlapped in both splits of the analysis (supplementary figure 2a). The overlapped region was included in the result of the original analysis. We also examined the robustness of the association between RRS and the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity. The significant RTPJ region in one split was used to evaluate the connectivity in samples from another split (supplementary figure 2b). When the RTPJ region for the first split was tested with the second split samples, the RRS association was significant (t[107] = 2.156,   p   = 0.033), and when the RTPJ region for the second split was tested with the first split samples, the RRS association was close to significance (t[106] = 1.952,   p   = 0.054). Although significance level decreased in a split data, the same trend of the association between the RRS and the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity was replicated in both splits. 


### Simulation of online functional connectivity neurofeedback signal 
  
The FC between the precuneus and the RTPJ was determined as a promising rtfMRI-nf target to relieve the rumination symptoms. We, therefore, performed a simulation analysis of online FC neurofeedback signal for this connectivity. Control ROI for the two-point method was placed at the right precentral region (6mm-radius sphere centered at x, y,   z   = 31, −29, 69 mm in MNI), where the correlation between motion and its connectivity with the precuneus was highest in the cortex. Thus, controlling the signal change in this ROI could remove the effect of motion on the FC neurofeedback signal.

Including the control point in the two-point method decreased the correlation, and the more time points the online calculation included, the higher the correlation with the offline measure was observed.  b shows the distribution of correlation between head motion and online connectivity measures across participants. The plot indicates that the more time points the online calculation included, the more participants had a high absolute correlation with motion.

## Discussion 
  
We performed a data-driven process-based search for a rtfMRI-nf target of functional connectivity associated with rumination symptoms using resting-state fMRI data on the cohort of mood and anxiety disorder individuals and healthy controls. The connectome-wide association analysis revealed that the connectivity between the precuneus (−6, −54, 48 mm in MNI) and the RTPJ (49, −49, 23 mm in MNI) was significantly associated with depressive RRS as well as brooding and reflective RRS in MA, and this association was greater for unmedicated than medicated participants. The simulation analysis of the online FC neurofeedback signal for this connectivity indicated that while the methods with more time points had a high correlation with offline FC, these also had a high risk of contamination by motion. In addition, a method with more time points is also not favored in regard to the timeliness of feedback signal. 

While depressive and brooding components, rather than reflective component of RRS have been associated with the pathological effect of rumination ( ), the current data indicated that MA participants had significantly high reflective RRS as well as depressive and brooding RRS. High RRS in both reflective and brooding components was also observed in another study ( ). This observation was consistent with the study indicating that brooding and reflective rumination were not separate factors in depressed patients because these components could exacerbate each other in depression ( ). The significant effect of depressive RRS was found in the FC between the precuneus and RTPJ and between the precuneus and the left intraparietal sulcus (LIPS) region. The precuneus–RTPJ FC was significantly associated with all components of RRS, while the precuneus–LIPS FC was significantly associated only with depressive RRS. Considering that all components of RRS were significantly higher for MA than HC, and each component of RRS could exacerbate each other in a pathological state, the precuneus–RTPJ functional connectivity constitutes a promising intervention target for FC-based rtfMRI-nf to treat pathological rumination. 

The TPJ region, especially in the right hemisphere, has been implicated in attentional and social functions, including the theory of mind and self-other judgment ( ). Specifically, its anterior part is associated with externally-oriented, stimulus-driven attention with high connectivity to attentional selection regions, while its posterior part is associated with internally-oriented, stimulus-independent process with high connectivity to regions for social cognitions ( ;  ;  ). The RTPJ region in the present result was included in the posterior part of TPJ in either parcellation of anatomical connectivity of diffusion tensor imaging ( ), the task-related meta-analytic connectivity, or resting-state functional connectivity ( ). Meta-analysis studies also found that brain activations for social cognitive tasks overlapped with the DMN regions in the dorsomedial PFC, the precuneus, and the TPJ areas ( ;  ;  ). These regions coactivated in autobiographical memory and theory of mind tasks ( ). These suggest that high connectivity between the precuneus and RTPJ could be associated with thinking of autobiographical events in a social context that might be associated with exacerbation of negative judgment in rumination. Coactivation of the precuneus and the TPJ was also reported for the contrast between other- and self-agency conditions, with higher activation at the other-agency condition ( ;  ). Hence, critical thinking of autobiographical things with others’ viewpoints, which could amplify rumination severity, might be associated with a high precuneus–RTPJ connectivity. 

This connectivity, however, has not been identified in studies investigating FCs associated with self-referential processing and rumination symptoms. Actually, several studies suggest that MPFC was involved in self-referential processing and rumination. The MPFC implication in self-referential thinking has been indicated in a direct examination of a self-referential thinking task, which showed that MPFC activity was high in self-referential thinking relative to a general thinking condition ( ). Interestingly, while RRS was positively correlated with this activity in healthy participants, it was negatively correlated with RRS in remitted MDD participants. This decreased MPFC activity associated with high RRS in participants with a high risk of MDD suggests that the self-recognition process decreased in the ruminative state. If the present result of increased precuneus–RTPJ connectivity is linked to thinking with others’ viewpoints ( ;  ), the decrease of MPFC activity associated with a decreased self-recognition process might be consistent with the current result. Thus, the precuneus-RTPJ FC might not be implicated in the self-referential processing itself but could be related to the process of exacerbating and maintaining pathological rumination through thinking autobiographical events with critical others’ perspective. 

Alterations in FC associated with rumination have also been indicated for MPFC seed connectivity. Increased resting-state FC between the MPFC seed and the PCC was correlated with reflective rumination for female participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) ( ). This result is partly consistent with the present result that found the association between reflective RRS and the MPFC connectivity ( ,  ). Resting-state FC between the dorsal MPFC seed and the temporal pole was positively correlated with depressive rumination for first-episode treatment-naïve young adults with MDD ( ). Resting-state FC between the MPFC seed and the left inferior parietal lobule was also positively correlated with the severity of negative self-focused thought ( ). Positive correlation with negative self-focused thought was also seen for pregenual ACC seed connectivity with the dorsolateral PFC, the precuneus, the inferior parietal cortex, and the paracentral lobule extending to SMA ( ). Resting-state FC for the subgenual ACC with the right middle and inferior frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with RRS ( ). These results suggest that MPFC is implicated in self-referential processing and the rumination process, while the associated FC was not consistent. 

We should note that the results of these FC association with rumination studies cannot be compared to the current result because those used a priori defined seed ROI, and the analysis for the RRS association was performed post hoc for the FC with a significant difference between the depressed and healthy groups. Thus, even though the current effect has not been found in those studies, they do not contradict the current result. Also, while the present analysis did not find associations between depressive rumination and FC in the MPFC, this could be explained by the low sensitivity of MDMR analysis relative to a seed-based connectivity analysis ( ). Since the MDMR analysis could find a significant association only with a large effect, the found association between the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity and the RRS should be considered a robust result. In addition, the aim of this analysis was to discover the rtfMRI-nf intervention target, not to describe the connectivity affected by the rumination comprehensively. Thus, finding the FC with a robust association with rumination should be suitable for the present purpose. 

Additionally, we performed simulation analysis to find the optimal online functional connectivity neurofeedback signal for the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity. The real-time fMRI processing simulation indicated a trade-off between the correlation with offline FC and the risk of motion contamination. The higher correlation with the offline FC for the methods with more time points was not surprising because the offline FC includes all time points for its calculation. The higher correlation with motion was because the methods with more time points had prolonged dependence on signal history, which could spread the effect of a time point with a significant head motion to many points of the neurofeedback signal. Dependence of long signal history is also unfavored regarding the timeliness of the feedback signal. Because a motion artifact could be critical as a risk of implicit learning of artifact effect in rtfMRI-nf training ( ), and the online rtfMRI-nf signal should minimize the delay as the fMRI signal already includes the hemodynamic response delay, a feedback signal with fewer time points should be preferred. While the correlation with offline FC was lower for the methods with fewer time points, the observed correlation, higher than 0.5 ( a), could be high enough to train the participants to regulate the target connectivity. As a matter of fact, many rtfMRI-nf studies demonstrated successful self-regulation training even without a comprehensive real-time noise reduction process ( ), and the correlation between the online- and offline-calculated signals was not high when the real-time noise reduction process was not comparable to the offline one ( ). When we performed a simulation with only the motion correction in real-time processing – which is a conventional rtfMRI process used in many studies – the correlation between the online and offline FC was less than 0.5 even for the highest online FC neurofeedback signal (10-TR sliding-window). This indicates that an online neurofeedback signal with a correlation as high as 0.5 with offline-evaluated FC could be enough to train a participant to regulate the target brain activity. Taken together, we consider the two-point method or a sliding-window correlation with short window width as favored to an online FC neurofeedback signal. 

For the two-point method, using the control ROI did not help to reduce the motion effect compared to the two-point method without the control ROI ( b). This result could be attributed to the fact that the current real-time fMRI processing simulation included a comprehensive noise reduction process; thus, the additional benefit of controlling motion was minimal. The control region is employed to ensure the specificity of the feedback signal to the target connectivity. While we picked a control region whose connectivity with the precuneus was correlated with motion, other kinds of unspecific effects on the connectivity, such as breathing, should also be controlled ( ). A single control ROI, therefore, is not enough to reduce all unspecific effects. However, employing multiple control regions in the two-point method complicates the calculation as well as the meaning of the feedback signal. Indeed, in the simulation, using the control ROI decreased the correlation with offline FC evaluation for the target, which was due to a reduced positive feedback frequency with restriction by the control ROI. This suggests that noise reduction in preprocessing is preferred to using a control ROI. The current real-time fMRI processing used in the simulation included not only regressors of motion but also cardiac and respiration noise (RETROICOR), the mean white matter signal, and the mean ventricle signal. This comprehensive process could help to reduce unspecific effects on the connectivity and reduce the necessity of using a control ROI in the two-point method. 

The connectome-wide investigation indicated that the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity was positively correlated with rumination severity. Hence, the rtfMRI-nf training to treat rumination symptoms should train a participant to decrease this connectivity. At the rtfMRI-nf training to decrease FC, the two-point method is more convenient than the sliding-window correlation because the sliding-window correlation requires a baseline level of connectivity to present feedback for signal reduction. Defining baseline connectivity is not a trivial task, though - it will need a personalized approach. In contrast, the two-point method does not need a baseline setting because the feedback signal is a binary value. We can give positive feedback when the two regions have different change directions, and give no feedback when they are the same. In light of these considerations, we suggest that the two-point method without control ROI is the most convenient, robust to motion, and timely online FC neurofeedback method to train a participant to decrease FC as far as we use the comprehensive real-time fMRI noise reduction process. 

Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. Although the association between RRS and the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity was seen specifically for the MA group, this specificity could be due to the unbalanced number of participants. The present result might be biased to the MA population, and may not be generalized to rumination for the preclinical population. With the limitation of the sensitivity of MDMR, the analysis could detect only the association with a large effect. MDMR analysis is insensitive to a change in a small region because the analysis depends on the between-subject distance matrix, which summarizes the difference between a whole-brain connectivity maps into one distance measure ( ,  ). Permutation test used in the analysis also limits the sensitivity ( ). As the bias-variance trade-off in model complexity suggested ( ), null distribution in the permutation test could have large variance with a large multivariate model fitted to a limited number of samples, which makes it hard to find a significant effect. Therefore, the absence of a significant effect in other symptoms does not prove the absence of their effect on resting-state FC. Limiting the MDMR search within the MPFC and PCC/Prec areas could also limit the findings. While limiting the search region has methodological merit in increasing the analysis sensitivity, and these areas are the most credible regions for searching for association with rumination, there might be FCs that do not stem from these areas but have a strong association with rumination symptoms. Nevertheless, the identified association between RRS and the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity was significant, and this connectivity is a promising target of rtfMRI-nf that can possibly treat rumination symptoms. We should remember that the present result did not describe a comprehensive abnormality of resting-state FC associated with rumination but rather discovered the credible target of rtfMRI-nf intervention to treat rumination symptoms. 


## Conclusion 
  
The data-driven process-based approach discovered the functional connectivity locus in the precuneus associated with rumination severity. We showed that the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity is a promising target of rtfMRI-nf intervention to treat rumination symptoms. The simulation analysis of the online FC neurofeedback signal suggested that the two-point method without control ROI was robust to motion, less dependent on the signal history, and convenient for the training to decrease FC. In future studies, we will examine the utility of rtfMRI-nf training to reduce the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity with the two-point method for alleviating pathological rumination. 

The present study offers a discovery framework for the precise location of functional connectivity targets for rtfMRI-nf intervention. This framework could identify the target with high spatial specificity and is applicable to a wide range of symptom dimensions. In the future, the current approach could help rtfMRI-nf become fully-fledged as a clinical treatment, with a direct application of the neuroimaging result to clinical interventions focused on improving psychiatric symptoms and modifying the trajectory of psychiatric disorders.

# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
Recently, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has been described as the earliest at-risk state of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and drawn attention of investigators. Studies suggested that SCD-community individuals may constitute a more vulnerable population than SCD-clinic patients, therefore, to investigate the early changes of the brain may provide guidance for treatment of the disease. We sought to investigate the changes of structure and functional connectivity alternation of the hippocampus in individuals with SCD recruited from the community using structural and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). 


## Methods 
  
Thirty-five SCD patients and 32 healthy controls were recruited. Resting-state fMRI data and high-resolution T1-weighted images were collected. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry was used to examine the brain structural changes. We also used the hippocampal tail and the whole hippocampus as seeds to investigate functional connectivity alternation in SCD. 


## Results 
  
Individuals with SCD showed significant gray matter volume decreases in the bilateral hippocampal tails and enlargement of the bilateral paracentral lobules. We also found that individuals with SCD showed decreased hippocampal tail resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) with the right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and decreased whole hippocampus rsFC with the bilateral mPFC and TPJ. These brain region and FC showing significant differences also showed significantly correlation with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. 


## Conclusion 
  
Individuals with SCD recruited from the community is associated with structural and functional changes of the hippocampus, and these changes may serve as potential biomarkers of SCD.

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is increasing all over the world. According to the World Alzheimer Report ( ), there were about 50 million people worldwide living with dementia in 2018, and this number is expected to more than triple by 2050. However, there are no effective treatments for AD, and recent drugs targeting tau pathology and amyloid-β at the mild or moderate dementia stage have failed to treat the disease ( ;  ). Moreover, the difficulties of treating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) suggests that treatment should be applied at an earlier stage of the disease ( ;  ). 

Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has been described as the earliest at-risk state of AD and increases the risk for developing MCI and future AD ( ;  ). It refers to individuals who have self-perceived persistent decline in cognition while neuropsychological tests remain within the normal range ( ). Recently, SCD has been receiving increased attention as a risk factor for the development of AD ( ). 

In addition, studies have suggested that the recruitment sources for SCD studies may have a significant influence on study outcomes. For instance   found higher atrophy progression over time and a relatively smaller proportion of APOE ε4 carriers in patients from an SCD clinic compared SCD patients from the community. This finding reinforced their previous study, which found that those who seek consultation are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome ( ). It indicated that SCD-clinic patients may constitute a more vulnerable population than SCD-community patients. They may be at increased risk for cognitive decline and possibly Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome ( ). 

In recent years, brain imaging has been used to investigate the structural and functional alterations of individuals with SCD. A number of papers on SCD have revealved reduced volume in medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures, including the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex ( ;  ;  ;  ). These brain alterations are similar to those found in MCI patients, suggesting that SCD may be a pre-MCI stage ( ). Functional changes have also been detected in individuals with SCD. For example, task-based fMRI studies ( ;  ) have identified neural network disruptions during cognitive processes in SCD compared with controls. 

To our knowledge, few studies have been applied on SCD-community individuals. In this study, we combined voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis and resting-state functional connectivity to investigate the patterns of structural and functional brain alterations in individuals with SCD recruited from the community compared with healthy controls. We hypothesized that functional connectivity disruption with or without hippocampal atrophy may be detected in SCD-community individuals compared with healthy controls (HC). 


## Materials and Methods 
  
All research procedures were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was registered in  . 

### Participants 
  
Thirty-five SCD subjects and 32 healthy control subjects were recruited from local communities between January 2016 and January 2018. All participants went through standard clinical assessments, including interviews with medical history, neurological examinations, and a series of neuropsychological tests. The neuropsychological tests were conducted by two neurologists and included the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale, and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). In addition, there were six neuropsychological tests. Specifically, delayed recall and recognition of Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Animal Fluency Test, the 30-item Boston Naming Test (BNT), and Part A and Part B of the Trail Making Test (TMT) were used to evaluate participants’ three cognitive domains: memory, language, and attention/executive function.

### MRI Data Acquisition 
  
All MRIs were performed with a 3.0T Siemens Magnetom Verio MRI System (Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany). To avoid head movement, each participant’s head was immobilized by foam pads in a standard 8-channel birdcage head coil. BOLD-fMRI images were obtained with a single-shot gradient-recalled echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) / echo time (TE) = 2000 ms/30 ms, field of view (FOV) = 240 × 240 mm, flip angle = 90°, matrix size = 64 × 64, slice thickness = 5 mm, and slices = 31. High-resolution T1-weighted images were then acquired with a volumetric 3D spoiled gradient recall sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE = 1900 ms/2.22 ms, FOV = 250 mm × 250 mm, flip angle = 9°, matrix size: 256 × 256, slice thickness = 1 mm, and 176 slices. 


### Brain Morphometry Data Analysis 
  
The processing of structural MRI data was performed with the VBM12-toolbox  incorporated in Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12 ). Each MRI image was first segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using VBM12-toolbox. Then, the GM images were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the Diffeomorphic Anatomic Registration of the using Exponentiated Lie (DARTEL) algorithm. The registered gray matter partitions were multiplied by Jacobian determinants with only non-linear warping to exclude individual differences in total intracranial volume. Finally, modulated warped GM segments were resliced to an isotropic voxel-size of 1.5 mm . Volumes were automatically determined from the modulated warped resliced GM segments. The GM segments were smoothed with a Gaussian smoothing kernel of 8 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM). 

Group analysis was applied using a two-sample   t  -test in SPM 12 with gender, age, GDS, years of education, and whole brain volume as covariates. A voxel-wise threshold of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected) and a cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05 (family-wise error correction) were applied for data analysis. In addition, given the important role of the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in memory processing ( ;  ,  ;  ), we predefined the left / right hippocampus and MPFC as regions of interest and prepared templates using the WFU PickAtlas tool . A voxel-wise threshold of   p   < 0.005 and a cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05 corrected using 3dClustSim were applied for the regions of interest data analysis. 


### Resting State Functional Connectivity Data Analysis 
  
Preprocessing was performed with CONN (CONN ). The first five volumes of each functional time series were removed to avoid the instability of the initial MRI signal. The remaining images were corrected for acquisition time delay between different slices and realigned to the first volume. The head motion parameters were calculated by estimating the translation in every direction and the angular rotation on each axis for every volume. 

The realigned functional images were then spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the normalization parameters estimated by T1 structural image unified segmentation and re-sampled to 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm voxels. Several sources of spurious variance, such as the estimated motion parameters and average BOLD signals in ventricular and white matter regions, were removed from the images. After removing the variance, linear drift was removed and a temporal filter (0.01–0.08 Hz) was then performed on the time series of each voxel to reduce the effect of low-frequency drifts and high-frequency noise. Artifact detection toolbox was used to further correct head motion. 

In this study, the regions of interest (seeds) were 1) hippocampus areas that showed significant difference between the SCD and controls derived from VBM analysis (bilateral hippocampal tail) and 2) bilateral whole hippocampus as defined by AAL atlas ( ). 

The mean BOLD time course was extracted from the selected seeds of each subject. Pearson correlation coefficients were estimated between the mean time course of the seed region and the time courses of all other voxels. Pearson correlation coefficients were then normalized to z-scores with Fisher’s r-to-z transformation to acquire the entire brain z-score map of each subject for each condition. 

A two-sample   t  -test was applied in SPM12 to compare the differences between the two groups. A voxel-wise threshold of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected) and a cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05 (family-wise error corrected) were applied for data analysis. Age, gender, GDS, and years of education were included as covariates. 


### Statistical Analysis 
  
Demographic and clinical data were analyzed in SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Inc.). Measured data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. A two-sample   t  -test was used to compare age, years of education, and MoCA. Sex between groups was compared using a Pearson chi-squared test. Comparisons of clinical difference among the two groups (HC and SCD) were performed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and all demographic factors (gender, age, GDS, years of education, and whole brain volume) as covariates. Correlation analysis was used to estimate the relationship between MoCA and AVLT scores and neuroimaging findings in SCD and HC (  p   < 0.05 was considered significant).

### Resting State Functional Connectivity Results 
  
With the bilateral hippocampal tail as the seed, SCD subjects showed decreased rsFC with the right mPFC and the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ) compared to HC subjects (  and  ). With the whole hippocampus as the seed, similar results were observed (i.e., SCD subjects showed decreased FC with the bilateral mPFC and the bilateral TPJ compared to HC subjects) (  and  ).

To explore the association between functional connectivity and clinical outcomes, we applied a correlation analysis between brain areas showing significant functional connectivity difference and MoCA scores, and we found that MoCA scores were negatively correlated with the decreased bilateral hippocampus tails-right mPFC rsFC (  r   = −0.449,   p   < 0.001, significant after Bonferroni correction), bilateral hippocampus tail-left TPJ rsFC (  r   = −0.467,   p   < 0.001, significant after Bonferroni correction),bilateral hippocampus-bilateral mPFC rsFC (  r   = −0.374,   p   = 0.002, significant after Bonferroni correction) and bilateral hippocampus-bilateral TPJ rsFC (  r   = −0.395,   p   = 0.001, significant after Bonferroni correction) across all subjects ( ). 



## Discussion 
  
In this study, we investigated the differences of brain morphometry and resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between SCD (recruited from the community) and controls. We found that SCD is associated with a GMV decrease in the bilateral hippocampal tails and a GMV increase in the bilateral paracentral lobules. In addition, SCD subjects showed decreased hippocampus rsFC with the mPFC and TPJ. 

Hippocampus plays an important role in memory processing and is considered among the first regions affected in AD pathological process ( ), of which the decreased volume is one of the most validated and widely used biomarkers of AD ( ). Converging evidences demonstrated total ( ) or partial ( ;  ) hippocampus volume decreased in SCD. In the present study, we found decreased GMV of bilateral hippocampal tails in individuals with SCD which was consistent with previous studies. In addiction, the decreased left hippocampus tail GMV was significantly positive correlated with AVLT-dr scores which showed significant group difference. Studies revealed that AVLT is among the most sensitive episodic memory tests ( ) and the delayed recall test was indicated to best identify early AD as well as predict the conversion to AD ( ;  ). It is universally known that episodic memory is the first cognitive domain involved in the AD spectrum and the most sensitive neuropsychological indicator for early AD ( ). The AD pattern of gray matter was found in SCD which correlated with episodic memory decline ( ), and RAVLT demonstrated significant association with the Hippocampal Occupancy Score and hippocampal volumes in the AD spectrum ( ). However, the change of hippocampus tends to be asymmetry in SCD, and the structural MRI studies revealed a decreased volume preferred the right hippocampus ( ). While the verbal information may depend on the left hippocampus ( ), which supports our result. 

We also found an increased GMV in the paracentral lobule in individuals with SCD, which has not been previously reported. The paracentral lobule is comprised in the sensorimotor network and involved in the primary sensation and movement of the lower back, legs, and feet, as well as control of the bladder and bowel function. The alterations of pathology and structure in the sensorimotor cortices was least observed in aMCI and they are found to be preserved in AD relatively ( ;  ). Accordingly, the increased ReHo found in the sensorimotor network might be interpreted as compensatory mechanism to the functional disruptions of other brain networks ( ). However, study with the result of functional abnormality in aMCI ( ) provided support to the assumption that part of the motor areas might have cognitive functions ( ). Decreased volume in the paracentral lobule was found in AD ( ). A recent study revealed altered subnetworks including paracentral lobule which were correlated with the scores of the neurocognitive assessments in SCD ( ). We speculate that the enlargement of the paracentral lobule may reflecting a potential compensatory mechanism. It is still uncertain whether it has underlying correlation with cognitive function or be affected indirectly by the disruption of other brain regions. Further studies are needed to validate our finding. 

We identified significant disrupted connectivity between the hippocampal tail/whole hippocampus and the mPFC and TPJ, and these disruptions were negatively correlated with MoCA scores. These areas are all important regions of the default mode network (DMN) ( ), which has been vulnerable to AD. It is worth noting that using the whole hippocampus as a seed resulted in more extensive functional connectivity changes than using only the hippocampal tail as a seed. Studies suggest that hippocampal subregions may play different roles ( ;  ) and are affected differently in patients with AD ( ;  ).   and   used the hippocampal subfields or the whole hippocampus as seeds and revealed functional connectivity disruption in brain regions including the mPFC, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, temporal lobe, and angular cortex in AD and SCD. Our results are consistent with previous studies and provide indirect support for a previous hypothesis that functional abnormality may occur before structural alteration in patients with SCD ( ). 

Literature suggests that communication between the hippocampus and mPFC plays an important role in memory processes ( ;  ;  ). For instance, Van Kesteren et al. ( ,  ) investigated how connections between the hippocampus and the mPFC relate to the incorporation of new memories into existing abstract frameworks. They found that hippocampus-mPFC connectivity is enhanced during and shortly after the successful encoding of novel information.   found that functional connectivity between the hippocampal tail and mPFC was associated with accuracy of memory self-rating, which indicates that hippocampus-mPFC functional connectivity is closely related to memory. Investigators have also found decreased functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and superior mPFC in SCD ( ). In a previous study, we found that mind-body intervention can significantly modulate hippocampus-mPFC rsFC and that this change is associated with memory function changes ( ). Thus, our results align with previous findings. 

The TPJ refers to an area of the cortex at the junction of the posterior superior temporal sulcus, inferior parietal lobule, and lateral occipital cortex. A brain imaging study ( ) suggested that the TPJ is involved in various processes such as episodic memory retrieval, attention, language and speech, temporal processing, social cognition and resting state activity.   investigated functional connectivity between the bilateral TPJ and other brain regions, such as the prefrontal, middle cingulate cortex, and insula, and found that the right TPJ functional connectivity was strongest with the ventral attention network, while left TPJ connectivity was strongest with the executive control network (ECN). Consequently, altered functional connectivity between the hippocampus and TPJ may contribute to the abnormal memory and attention function in SCD. 

Montreal Cognitive Assessment is an efficient and rapid screening tool for cognitive dysfunction involving memory, executive function, and attention ( ) and has moderate specificity and high sensitivity ( ). Previous studies have found that MoCA scores significantly correlate with both structural and functional brain alterations in SCD ( ;  ). We also observed a significant correlation between MoCA scores and both structural and functional alterations in the current study, which shed light on the significance of these brain function and morphometry findings. 

There are several potential limitations to the present study. First, our results were limited by the relatively small sample sizes. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to further confirm our findings. Second, the participants involved in our study were only recruited from the community. SCD participants recruited from hospitals/clinics (i.e., medical help-seeking individuals) should be involved in future studies, and a comparison should be between these two groups. Third, we only included structural MRI and rs-fMRI. Future studies could incorporate relevant biomarkers such as β-amyloid and tau proteins. Finally, the present study was cross-sectional. A longitudinal study is needed to assess whether structural and functional alterations in SCD could predict the development of the disease. 

In summary, we found that SCD individuals recruited from the community is associated with decreased GMV at the hippocampal tail, increased GMV at the paracentral lobules, and decreased hippocampus rsFC with the mPFC and TPJ. Our findings may shed new light on the neuroimaging biomarker of SCD.

Intrinsic Cerebro-Cerebellar Functional Connectivity Reveals the Function of Cerebellum VI in Reading-Related Skills

# Keywords

# Abstract
 
The engagement of the cerebellum VI in reading was reported in both typically developing and dyslexic readers. However, it is still not clear how the cerebellum VI contributes to reading. Here we have examined the correlation of intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity with two critical reading-related skills—phonological awareness (PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN)—with fMRI technology. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the cerebellum may contribute to reading either by phonological skills or by automatizing skills. We chose the left and right cerebellum VI as ROIs, and we calculated the intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity during a resting state. We further explored whether and how cerebro-cerebellar resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) is associated with individuals’ reading-related skills including PA and RAN. The results showed that the functional connectivity between the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral cerebellum VI was related to RAN, and the connectivity between the left insula and right cerebellum VI was related to PA. However, the effect of PA did not survive after the RAN was regressed out. Control analyses further confirmed that it was the intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity rather than the local cerebellar functionality that associated with phonological awareness ability and rapid automatized naming ability. For the first time, the relationship between cerebro-cerebellar resting state functional connectivity and specific reading-related skills has been explored, and this has deepened our understanding of the way the cerebellum VI is involved in reading. 
 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
Increasing evidence has shown that the cerebellum is engaged in high-level cognitive processing, particularly, in reading ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). For example, numerous studies have reported that the cerebellum was involved in a variety of reading tasks, including phonological processing, visual letter recognition, as well as semantic processing ( ;  ;  ;  ). Particularly, the bilateral cerebellum VI, a middle part of the cerebellum, plays a more essential role than other parts in reading. A voxel-based morphometry study found a significant negative correlation between the gray matter volume of the left cerebellum VI (lobule VI/Crus I) and reading accuracy in normal readers ( ). A meta-analysis also found that the right cerebellum VI was consistently activated during reading-related tasks ( ). Although these findings suggest a relationship between the bilateral cerebellum VI and reading, it remains unclear how the cerebellum VI contributes to reading. 

The involvement of the cerebellum in high-level cognitive processing could be attributed to the structural and functional cerebro-cerebellar connection ( ). As a support,   observed that the cerebellum VI functionally connected with cerebral regions during reading, including the left fusiform gyrus, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the left lateral temporal cortex.   further found that abnormality of cerebro-cerebellar connections was associated with reading impairment, suggesting that variation of cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity is associated with differences in reading ability. 

A previous study indicated that an intrinsic network organization underlying cognitive processes can be reflected by resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) ( ). For example, RSFC is associated with individual differences in several cognitive domains, including executive control, episodic memory, and learning ( ;  ;  ). Compared to functional connectivity during certain cognitive task, RSFC indicates intrinsic, task-independent features of brain function ( ;  ). Importantly, task-induced BOLD activity could be predicted by RSFC ( ;  ), and the reading network can also be investigated during the resting state ( ).   found that reading competence positively related to RSFC between the left precentral gyrus and other motor regions as well as between the pars opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior part of the left superior temporal gyrus, suggesting that reading can be facilitated by stronger connectivity among motor regions and between language regions. Besides, it was proposed that RSFC was associated with Chinese reading abilities ( ;  ;  ). A recent study further observed that the strength of RSFC between the left thalamus and the right cerebellum, which are thought to be associated with attention, is positively correlated with phonological fluency ( ). However, up until now, no study has directly explored whether RSFC between the cerebellum and cerebrum is associated with reading. 

As to the mechanism of how the cerebellum is engaged in reading, the cerebellar deficit hypothesis proposed that articulatory processing and automatizing processing were two key components that the cerebellum possibly contributes toward, the deficit of which can lead to subsequent problems when learning how to read ( ). Moreover, lack of articulatory fluency will finally lead to difficulties in phonological awareness ( ). Evidence to support this hypothesis comes from two aspects. Firstly, cerebellum was indeed engaged in phonological ( ;  ) and automatizing processing ( ;  ). Secondly, phonological skill and automatizing skill are closely related to reading. For example, phonological awareness (PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN, a way to estimate automatizing skill) have been confirmed as significant predictors of reading performance across languages ( ;  ;  ). A meta-analysis further revealed that PA and RAN were correlated to reading accuracy and reading fluency, respectively ( ). These two skills have frequently been used to evaluate reading abilities ( ,  ) and distinguish between dyslexic and normal readers ( ). 

The cerebellar deficit hypothesis also indicated that reading impairment can be caused by cerebellar deficits showing up before reading acquisition, and the cerebellum plays a vital role in the initial stage of reading ( ). A meta-analysis has reported both common and divergent reading-related activation in children and adults ( ), and a previous study also proposed that reading competence was related to different RSFC patterns in children and adults ( ).   demonstrated that better reading performance was associated with stronger functional coupling between the fusiform gyrus and phonology-related regions/default mode network in adults but not in children. The research to date has tended to focus on RSFC-reading relationships in adults ( ;  ;  ). However, far too little attention has been paid to the relationship between RSFC and reading in children ( ). Given reading skills are not yet fully matured during childhood, studies based on children can investigate the way the cerebellum affects reading in the developmental stages. 

The current study has aimed to examine whether and how the intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity (RSFC) associates with the two important reading-related skills—phonological and automatizing skills—in children. For this purpose, we have analyzed the correlation between intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity with PA and RAN, both of which are important predictors of reading performance. Given the convergent evidence, which showed that the cerebellum VI was consistently involved in reading, we chose bilateral cerebellum VI as regions of interest (ROIs). We hypothesized that reading-related cognitive processes were supported by the cooperation of the cerebellum and cerebrum. Specifically, both PA and RAN scores were associated with the intrinsic functional connectivity between the cerebellum VI and cerebral areas. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Fifty-seven typically developing children without reading disorders [31 males and 26 females, mean age = 10.19 years, standard deviation (SD) = 0.96] took part in the experiment. All participants were native speakers of Mandarin and were recruited and screened from several primary schools in Beijing from grades three to six. They were all right-handed and had normal IQs (Raven Percentiles ≥50, Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices:  ) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. In addition, children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD,  ), neurological disease, or psychiatric disorders were excluded. All the 57 participants meet the criteria of head motion not exceeding 3 mm or 3°. This study was approved by the Institutional Reviews Board of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning at Beijing Normal University, and written consent was obtained from the children and their parents. 


### Behavior Measures 
  
Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices was applied to test the children’s IQ. A Chinese phonological awareness test ( ,  ) and a rapid automatized naming test ( ) were then used to evaluate the children’s phonological and automatizing skills. Details of the two tests are described below. 

#### Chinese Phonological Awareness (PA) Test 
  
The Chinese phonological awareness test consists of four subtests: phoneme deletion, tone detection, onset detection, and rime detection. In the phoneme deletion test, the participants were asked to pronounce a given word after deleting a phoneme, for example, “shua3” after removing “a” should be pronounced as “shu3.” In the tone/onset/rime deletion test, the participants were asked to find the one word, out of four words, that differed (by the tone, onset, or rime level). For example, when it comes to the tone level, such as [ba4, san4, bei4, bo1], the different one is bo1; for the onset detection, [ba3, san1, bei4, bo1], the correct answer is san1; and for the rime detection, [ban3, san1, ban4, bo1], bo1 was the different one. The number of correct answers was recorded as a raw score. Raw scores were firstly converted into   Z   scores in each grade and then into standard scores with a mean of 100 and SD of 15. Averaged   Z   scores of the four tests indicated the phonological processing ability. The higher the score, the better the phonological awareness. 


#### The Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) Test 
  
The rapid automatized naming test was used to measure automatization ability ( ). When performing this task, participants were required to read out visually-presented Arabic numbers as quickly and accurately as possible. The participants did the test twice, and the total time to read all digits was recorded each time. The average time was calculated and translated into   Z   scores in each grade. The   Z   scores were then multiplied by −1, and they were then converted into standard scores with a mean of 100 and SD of 15; higher scores represented better performances. 



### Imaging Procedure and Acquisition 
  
Resting-state images were acquired with a 3T Siemens scanner at Beijing Normal University. Before the formal experiment, the participants participated in 20 min of training in a mock scanner in order to familiarize themselves with the environment and the requirements. The resting-state MRI scanning session lasted for 8 min. The participants were informed to close their eyes, keep their head and body still, and to think of nothing to avoid inner language disturbances. A T2-weighted gradient-echo EPI sequence was used to acquire functional images, and the acquisition parameters were TR = 2400 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 81°, FOV = 192 × 192 mm, slice number = 40 slices, slice thickness = 3 mm, and voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm. We used Sequential scanning. For better image registration, we also collected T1-weighted images, TR = 2300 ms, TE = 4.18 ms, flip angle = 9°, FOV = 256 × 256 mm, slice number = 176 slices, slice thickness = 1 mm, and voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm. 


### Data Analysis 
  
#### Preprocessing 
  
Functional MRI scans were preprocessed with DPABI software  ( ). The resting state functional image preprocessing included several steps: (1) the first 10 time points were deleted; (2) the slice-timing was corrected with the middle slice as the reference slice and realignment; (3) all functional images were co-registered to the corresponding anatomical image; (4) functional images were normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space; (5) the spatial was smoothed with 4 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel; (6) linear trends were removed, and band-pass temporal filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz) was applied. In addition, we regressed out six motion parameters, the white matter signal, and the cerebrospinal fluid signal to reduce motion and physiological signal interference. 


#### Cerebellum ROI 
  
Coordinates of the bilateral cerebellum VI were chosen based on a previous meta-analysis ( ). The sphere of the left cerebellum VI was centered at MNI coordinate (−22, −68, −20) and the right cerebellum VI was centered at MNI coordinate (24, −66, −24,  ). For each ROI, a sphere was created with a radius of 6 mm. 
  
The location of ROIs.   (A)   The coordinate of the left cerebellum VI is [–22, –68, –20] and the right cerebellum VI is [24, –66, –24].   (B)   The location of control ROI. The right cerebellum V [6, –64, –10], a motion-related region, is used for a control analysis. 
  
In addition, we chose the cerebellum V (MNI coordinate [6, −64, −10],  ;  ), related to motor function, as another ROI to use to perform a control analysis (for detailed information, see section “Control analyses”). For the display, the cerebellum ROIs were overlaid onto the suit template  with the software MRIcron . 


#### Correlation of Cerebro-Cerebellar RSFC and Reading-Related Skills 
  
We firstly extracted and averaged the BOLD signal of all voxels within each ROI (i.e., left or right cerebellum VI) used as the seed region for functional connectivity analysis. The time-series correlation of average BOLD signal between each seed region and each voxel in the bilateral cerebrum was calculated with SPM12 . The correlation coefficients were transformed into Fisher’s   Z   scores as an index for cerebro-cerebellar RSFC. Finally, we calculated the correlation between   Z   scores and the phonological or rapid naming test performances in each seed region. 

All the correlation maps were corrected for multiple comparisons by Gaussian random field (GRF) correction (voxel-level   p   < 0.001 and cluster-level   p   < 0.05, two-tailed) with DPABI software (see text Footnote 1;  ). GRF corrections were widely used to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) of testing multiple hypothesis in neuroimaging.   confirmed that the FWER can reach the nominal 5% level if the threshold was set voxel-wise   p   < 0.0005 and cluster-wise   p   < 0.025 to perform two one-tailed tests, which is equivalent to the threshold in our study (voxel-level   p   < 0.001 and cluster-level   p   < 0.05, two-tailed). This multiple comparison correction method was recommended when considering the FWER ( ). In addition, the peak voxel in each cluster was reported based on the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template ( ). All threshold brain images were overlaid onto the Brainmesh_ICBM152_smoothed.nv surf template with the software BrainNet Viewer ( )  for display. 

In our study, we were primarily concerned with how the cerebro-cerebellar RSFC associates with phonological skills and automatizing skills, as indicated by the measures of PA and RAN. We then first calculated the correlation between the cerebro-cerebellar RSFC with each skill separately. Given that there is potential correlation between Raven’s IQ, PA, and RAN, we additionally performed a partial correlation analysis. For details, when we calculated the correlation between cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and RAN, either the Raven’s IQ, the scores of PA, or both were used as the covariate(s). When we calculated the correlation between cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and PA, the Raven’s IQ, the scores of RAN, or both were used as the covariate(s). 


#### Control Analyses 
  
We further performed two control analyses to exclude potential confounds or other possibilities. Firstly, given the RSFC might be confounded by the local functionalities of the cerebellum, we calculated the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), a representative index of local brain functionalities in the resting state fMRI ( ), and explored whether the ALFF of bilateral cerebellum VI correlated to the two reading-related skills. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) measures the spontaneous activity of the specific brain area in order to reflect the local functionality property. We followed the calculation procedure used in previous studies ( ). Fast Fourier transform (FFT) was used to transform the time series to frequency domain. After calculating the power spectrum, it was square rooted, and the square root across 0.01–0.08 Hz was then averaged at each voxel, and this was taken as the ALFF. The ALFF of each voxel was divided by the mean ALFF value for standardization. At last, the averaged ALFF of each ROI was extracted for further correlation analysis. The significance of correlation was estimated by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. 

Secondly, we tested whether the cerebellum V, a region related to motor function, also showed correlation between intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and PA/RAN. During this analysis, we extracted the averaged BOLD signal of cerebral regions whose RSFC with the bilateral cerebellum VI correlated with PA or RAN. Then we calculated the RSFC between the cerebellum V and these cerebral regions to explore whether this intrinsic RSFC was associated with the two reading-related skills. This analysis aimed to answer whether the association between intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and reading-related skills is just a feature of the cerebellum VI or could be generalized to other cerebellum regions, such as the cerebellum V. In this analysis, we replaced the cerebellum VI with cerebellum V. The significance of correlation was also estimated by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

### Correlation of Cerebro-Cerebellar RSFC and Reading-Related Skills 
  
When the left cerebellum VI was used as a seed region, the RSFC of this ROI and the left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus) was significantly correlated with RAN scores (cluster-level GRF corrected   p   < 0.05, voxel-level   p   < 0.001; cluster size = 91,   and  ), which revealed that better RAN performance related to stronger functional connectivity. No significant correlation was observed between the PA scores and the RSFC (cluster-level GRF corrected   p   < 0.05, voxel-level   p   < 0.001).

(B)   Functional connectivity between right cerebellum VI and left INS was positively correlated with PA.   (C)   Functional connectivity between right cerebellum VI and left SMG was positively correlated with RAN under a loose threshold. L.SMG, the left supramarginal gyrus; L.INS, the left insula; RAN, rapid automatized naming; PA, phonological awareness. 
  
When the right cerebellum VI was used as a seed, the RSFC between the ROI and the left insula (extended to the superior temporal gyrus) was found to be correlated with PA (cluster-level GRF corrected   p   < 0.05, voxel-level   p   < 0.001, cluster size = 80,   and  ), suggesting that better PA performance also related to stronger functional connectivity. No significant correlation between RAN scores and RSFC was observed at this stringent threshold. However, we did observe a tendency for the RSFC between the ROI and the left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus) to correlate with RAN, which could survive with a loose threshold (voxel-level   p   < 0.001, uncorrected, cluster size = 62,   and  ). 

In order to exclude the potential effect of IQ on the results, we re-did the above brain and behavior correlation analyses with Raven’s IQ as the covariate. When Raven’s IQ was regressed out, the performance on RAN still correlated with the RSFC between the left cerebellum VI and left postcentral gyrus (extended to the supramarginal gyrus) and between the right cerebellum VI and left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus), using the corrected threshold as in the above analysis. But we can only observe the correlation of PA and RSFC between the right cerebellum VI and the left insular at a looser threshold (voxel-level   p   < 0.001, uncorrected,   and  ). 

Furthermore, when PA was regressed out, the performance on RAN was correlated with the RSFC between the left cerebellum VI and left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus) and between the right cerebellum VI and left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus) at the threshold of voxel-level   p   < 0.001, uncorrected. When RAN was used as a covariate, the correlation between PA and RSFC of the right cerebellum VI with the left insula did not survive, even with an uncorrected threshold (voxel-level threshold   p   < 0.001, uncorrected,   and  ). 

Finally, when PA and Raven’s IQ were regressed out, the correlation of RAN and the RSFC between the left cerebellum VI and left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus) and between the right cerebellum VI and left supramarginal gyrus (extended to the postcentral gyrus) could be observed with an uncorrected threshold (voxel-level   p   < 0.001, uncorrected). When RAN and Raven’s IQ were regressed out, the correlation between PA and RSFC did not survive even with an uncorrected threshold (voxel-level threshold   p   < 0.001, uncorrected;   and  ). 

Based on the above results, it is likely that the RSFC of the cerebellum VI does not directly contribute to PA. Instead, RSFC might be affected by PA via RAN. We then further conducted a mediation analysis to test this possibility. However, we did not observe a significant mediation effect of RAN for the cerebellum VI functional connectivity. Detailed information is displayed in the  . 


### Control Analyses 
  
For ALFF, no significant correlation was found between either the left or right cerebellum VI and reading-related skills in our study (  p  s > 0.2). Detailed correlation coefficients (  r  ) and   p   values are presented in  .

Additionally, the RSFCs of cerebellum V (MNI coordinate [6, −64, −10]) and cerebral regions, including the supramarginal gyrus (MNI coordinate [−63, −21, 27] and [−57, −18, 24]) and the left insular (MNI coordinate [−57, −3, 3]), were not significantly correlated with either reading-related skills (  p  s > 0.1,  ). 



## Discussion 
  
In the current study, we have aimed to investigate the way in which the cerebellum VI contributes to reading. More specifically, we tested whether the cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity during a resting state (RSFC) was associated with two essential reading-related skills: phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming. To this end, we chose the left and right cerebellum VI as ROIs based on a meta-analysis, and we calculated the correlation of cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and phonological awareness or rapid automatized naming. Our study showed that the connectivity between the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral cerebellum VI was related to rapid automatized naming, and the connectivity between the left insula and right cerebellum VI was related to phonological awareness. But the latter effect did not survive after the rapid automatized naming was regressed out. The control analyses further showed there is no significant correlation between the local functionality of the cerebellum VI (indicated with ALFF) and both reading-related skills, confirming the association between the intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity and reading-related skills cannot be interpreted by the local functionality of the cerebellum VI. The control analyses also showed that reading-related skills were not correlated with the RSFC between the cerebellum V and cerebral regions, illustrating how the observed intrinsic cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and reading-related skills were just features of the cerebellum VI. For the first time, we tested the hypothesis that the cerebellum contributes to reading, either by phonological skills or by automatizing skills through RSFC, which provided new findings as to how the cerebellum VI contributes to reading. 

It is worth noting that reading is a complex process, including not only the more basic levels of linguistic functions (phonological processing and lexical access) involved in reading but also the levels of conceptualization and situation model building ( ). Our study only focused on the former level. Previous studies frequently found the cerebellum VI is involved in reading ( ;  ;  ;  ). More specifically, the association between the cerebellum and rapid automatized naming has been reported in previous studies ( ), and the abnormity in the cerebellar-frontal circuit was found to be related to rapid automatized naming ( ). Rapid automatized naming was also associated with Chinese reading accuracy and fluency ( ,  ). Moreover,   has shown that RAN and reading rely on similar brain regions. Here we have illustrated that the cerebellum VI is involvd in reading through cerebro-cerebellar connections. Specifically, we found a positive relationship between cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and individuals’ performance in RAN. Our findings have provided the first evidence that the intrinsic connectivity during a resting state could be a predictive index for rapid automatized naming skills. 

The results of a partial correlation analysis were similar to that of the main analysis when Raven’s IQ was used as a covariate, suggesting such correlations were not affected by Raven’s IQ. We found that the correlation between the left cerebellum VI-left supramarginal gyrus RSFC and PA can survive when PA was regressed out at the threshold voxel-level (  p   < 0.001 uncorrected). Importantly, when PA was regressed out, we also found RAN correlated with RSFC between the right cerebellum VI and left supramarginal gyrus (voxel-level   p   < 0.001, uncorrected), although such an effect was unable to survive after a GRF multiple comparison correction in the main analysis. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between the bilateral cerebellum VI and the RAN. Importantly, when both the RAN and Raven’s IQ were regressed out, we did not observe PA correlated with RSFC between the right cerebellum VI and left insula, even at an uncorrected threshold (voxel-level   p   < 0.001). As proposed by the double-deficit hypothesis, PA and RAN would play a relatively independent role in reading ( ). Our findings did not support that the cerebellum VI was equally associated with PA and RAN. After all, the correlation between RSFC of the cerebellum and PA would not survive if RAN was used as a covariate, and we also did not observe if the RSFC of the cerebellum VI can be affected by PA via RAN. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that there might be some common components between these two abilities, which are associated with both articulation and automatization. 

The examination of RAN and PA provide insights into the understanding of the cerebellar deficit hypothesis of dyslexia, which has proposed that cerebellar deficit could cause both phonological and automatization deficits at the cognitive level ( ). Functional imaging studies have investigated the double-deficit hypothesis of developmental dyslexia by using the phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming ( ), which found that children with only phonological awareness deficits showed less activation in the left inferior frontal and inferior parietal regions compared to typically developing readers, and children with only a rapid naming deficit showed less activation in the cerebellum compared to typically developing readers. The current study further showed that the RAN–reading relationship may manifest through the RSFC between the cerebellum and cerebral regions, which is consistent with the established role of the speedy processing of the cerebellum. Actually, it has been frequently proposed that the relationship between RAN and reading should be observed ( ;  ;  ;  ). 

Notably, although PA and RAN are predictors of reading abilities, they are also associated with other cognitive functions, such as attention, working memory, and mathematics ( ;  ;  ;  ).   observed the predictive relation between PA and executive attention in Chinese-English bilingual children, thus suggesting the relationship between PA and executive function. Moreover, RAN was considered to mediate the relationship between attention and reading fluency ( ), suggesting that the attention ability may be associated with RAN. Other researchers have also proposed that the relationship between RAN and reading is due to executive functions, such as working memory and inhibition ( ). Accordingly, it is unclear whether our correlated functional connectivity via PA/RAN could be specifically dedicated to reading alone. 

In addition, we obtained the findings by studying Chinese children learning to read Mandarin. An interesting issue is whether the correlation between the cerebro-cerebellar RSFC and RAN could be generalized to alphabetic language. We have speculated that the answer is yes. RSFC exhibited significant positive correlations with reading abilities for Chinese children ( ;  ;  ). As for alphabetic language,   also observed that reading competence in children correlated positively with RSFC between the left precentral gyrus and other motor regions as well as between Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. Even though these studies did not directly examine the relationship between the RSFC of the cerebellum and reading competence, it has been reported that the cerebellum also played an essential role in phonological processing for alphabetic language ( ;  ). 

Finally, our findings have provided new evidence for the functional segregation of the cerebellum. Recent studies have shown that the anterior part of the cerebellum is responsible for movement and other low-level processing, while the posterior part of the cerebellum is mainly responsible for high-level cognitive functions, including language, memory, emotion, and so on ( ), which suggests that there is a functional segregation of cerebellum. Here we found that the cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity of the cerebellum VI but not cerebellum V correlated with certain reading-related skill(s), thus confirming the functional differentiation between the cerebellum VI and V. Future studies may be required to comprehensively examine how cerebellum is functionally segregated, and how the different subregions cooperate with cerebrum in reading or other high-level cognitive processing through cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity. 

There are some limitations in our study. Firstly, we performed resting-state functional connectivity rather than task-based, which may not be able to reliably generalize the findings based on RSFC to encompass task-related neural activity; we should be cautious when assessing the relationship between RSFC and reading-related skills ( ). Future studies are required to examine the association between task-related cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity and these reading-related skills. Secondly, a recent meta-analysis has shown that the reliability of RSFC is rather mediocre ( ), and our results need to be further validated by carrying out more research in the future. In addition, we only looked at RAN and PA without other reading-relevant cognitive factors, and these two tests were associated with other cognitive functions besides reading. The association of the connectivity between brain regions and the cognitive task has to be interpreted cautiously, as other factors may influence this association. Finally, our study is cross-sectional with a specific population of Chinese children learning to read Mandarin, a language substantially different form the western languages; whether the results can be generalized to encompass an alphabetic language requires further investigation. 

In conclusion, we found that the intrinsic functional connectivity between bilateral cerebellum VI and the left supramarginal gyrus was associated with RAN, and this correlation was not affected by the phonological awareness ability. These findings suggested that the relationship between the cerebellum and reading may have been related to the automatizing skill.

# Keywords

Mild traumatic brain injury

Insula subdivision


# Abstract
 
## Purpose 
  
This study aimed to investigate the early functional connectivity alterations between insula subdivisions and other cortical regions in patients with acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and subsequently to explore the relationship between functional connectivity changes of insula subdivisions with other cortical regions and cognitive function. 


## Methods 
  
Fifty-three mTBI patients and 37 age-, gender- and education level- matched healthy controls were included in this study. All participants obtained resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and clinical and neuropsychological evaluations (Montreal cognitive assessment, MoCA) at the acute stage. Functional connectivity alterations of insula subdivisions and correlations with MoCA were further explored by seed-voxel functional connectivity. 


## Results 
  
Compared with healthy controls, patients with acute mTBI showed significantly decreased functional connectivity between the L-vAI and the left middle temporal gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus and significantly decreased functional connectivity between the R-vAI and the right middle frontal gyrus and right hippocampus. While significantly decreased functional connectivity were observed between the L-dAI and the right superior frontal gyrus. In addition, significantly increased functional connectivity was observed between the R-PI and the left inferior frontal gyrus. Furthermore, the mTBI group demonstrated positive correlations between performances in orientation and insula and middle temporal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus functional connectivities. Abstraction scores for mTBI patients positively correlated with functional connectivity between insula and middle frontal gyrus. 


## Conclusions 
  
The present study demonstrated functional connectivity dysfunction of insula subdivisions and correlations between these alterations and cognitive performance, which provide a novel insight into the neurophysiological mechanism of cognitive impairment in patients with mTBI at the acute stage. 

 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) accounts for at least 75% of traumatic brain injury (Gardner and Yaffe  ). Moreover, a proportion of mTBI patients frequently develop cognitive deficitis following acute mTBI and may persist for months and even years after the initial injury, thus imposes an excessive societal burden (Stenberg et al.  ). However, the underlying pathophysiology of cognitive disorders remains controversial, partly because the cognitive symptoms are not specific because these patients often perform normal neuropsychological test and lack of structural brain damage on conventional anatomical brain computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)(Scheibel  ). Therefore, research on pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive impairment may help to provide strategy for the early diagnosis and treatment of cognitive deficit following acute mTBI. 

Insular cortex, traditionally is considered to be responsible for integrating internal and external processes (Tops and Boksem  ; Uddin et al.  ). However, growing findings showed that the insula plays a crucial role in response for salience events and mediates the control of cognition (Uddin et al.  ). Our previous work observed that the gray matter volume was significantly reduced in the insula in acute mTBI patients and the functional connectivity of insula with other brain regions was impaired in mTBI patients during the acute stage (Li et al.  ; Lu et al.  ). Following mTBI, previous neuroimaging studies have shown structural and functional connectivity abnormalities in the insula, such as smaller volume, decreased regional homogeneity (ReHo) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), and these alterations were related to cognitive scores. Meanwhile, a large body of literature indicated that insula, as a key node of SN salience network (SN) for initiating network switching, could mediate other important intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) such as the default mode network (DMN) and central executive network (CEN) (Seeley et al.  ). For mTBI patients, abnormal insular connectivity within the SN and dysfunctional interactions with DMN and CEN, and aberrant functional connectivity correlated with neurocognitive functioning were shown by several studies (Sours et al.  ; Vakhtin et al.  ; Chand et al.  ). 

Furthermore, parcellation studies using resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data revealed that the human insula can be subdivided into the anterior insula (a.i.) and the posterior insula (PI) which are involved in a wide range of cognitive processes, especially in restoring the cognitive functions (Iaria et al.  ; Taylor et al.  ; Lu et al.  ). Recent evidence consistently highlighted that a.i. is in response for cognitive function (Taylor et al.  ; Chand et al.  ; Peng et al.  ; Lu et al.  ). Additionally, we have previously shown decreased grey matter volumes of a.i. and disrupted functional connectivity of a.i. with other brain regions in mTBI patients during the acute stage (Li et al.  ; Lu et al.  ). All these results indicated the vital role of a.i. in the mechanisms of cognitive impairment. Mover, a.i. primarily comprises of the ventral anterior insula (vAI) and dorsal anterior insula (dAI), both of them are associated with arousal/interoceptive awareness, cognitive emotional processing, the dorsal anterior portion is specifically more involved in high level cognitive processes (Peng et al.  ). Meanwhile, the posterior insular (PI) is a cortical region related to processing of multimodal information such as interoceptive/exteroceptive information and sensory information (Peng et al.  ). Thus, it is necessary to explore the functional connectivity between the insula subdivisions and other brain regions to explain the cognitive symptoms of mTBI. However, to the best of our knowledge, whether there exist changes of functional connectivity between insula subdivisions and other cortical regions and whether the altered functional connectivity contributed to the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment have not been studied in acute mTBI patients. It is still mixed and not clear whether or how insula subdivisions alterations in patients with cognitive impairment following acute mTBI. To address these issues, we selected the bilateral insula as seed for analysis. 

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the abnormalities of functional connectivity between insula subdivisions and other cortical regions at the acute stage and subsequently to explore the association between functional connectivity changes of insula subdivisions and the cognitive test in these patients compared to healthy controls. We hypothesized that (1) patients following acute mTBI have disrupted functional connectivity between insula subdivisions and other cortical regions (2) these alterations would be associated with changes in neuropsychological assessment of cognitive functioning. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nanjing Medical University. All participants provided written informed consent before undergoing MR imaging. Between December 2017 and May 2019, patients with a diagnosis of mTBI within 2 weeks after trauma were prospectively enrolled in this study. mTBI was defined based on the American Congress of Rehabitation Medicine. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) patients aged 18 or older; (b) loss of consciousness < 30 min, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 13–15 and post-traumatic amnesia  < 24 h. Exclusion criteria were: (a) previous head injury; (b) history of pre-existing neurological or psychiatric disease; (c) history of illicit drug use or substance abuse; (d) dental appliances that might distort the functional MR images; (e) left-handed. The healthy control participants were recruited through local advertisements who met the same exclusion criteria applied to the patient group. 


### Cognitive assessment 
  
Given the emergency care setting, it was not feasible to perform a full battery of neuropsychological assessment. Therefore, a short instrument called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess the patients’ neurocognitive status (de Guise et al.  ). The MoCA is a sensitive cognitive screening test following mTBI and it only requires limited training to administer. The MoCA assesses eight cognitive domains including visuospatial/executive, naming, attention, language, abstraction, memory, and orientation. This test is administered in about 10 min and is scored on a maximum of 30 points. More than 26 was regarded as normal value with a lower score indicating greater cognitive deficit (Wang et al.  ). All participants completed the MoCA test within 12 h of MRI examination. 


### Imaging methods 
  
A 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner (Ingenia, Philips Medical Systems, Netherlands) with an 8-channel head coil was used for this study and the parallel imaging was employed. Functional images were obtained axially using a gradient echo-planar imaging sequence as follows: repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms; echo time (TE) = 30 ms; slices = 36; thickness = 4 mm; gap = 0 mm; field of view (FOV) = 240 mm × 240 mm; acquisition matrix = 64 × 64; and flip angle (FA) = 90°. The fMRI sequence took 8 min and 8 s. Three-dimensional turbo fast-echo (3D-TFE) T1WI sequence with high resolution: TR = 8.1 mm; TE = 3.7 ms; slices = 170; thickness = 1 mm; gap = 0 mm; FA = 8°; acquisition matrix = 256 × 256; FOV = 256 mm × 256 mm; Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery(FLAIR):TR = 7000 ms; TE = 120 ms; slices = 18; slice thickness = 6 mm; gap = 1.3 mm; FA = 110°; Voxel size = 0.65 × 0.95 × 6 mm . SWI: TR = 22 mm; TE = 34 ms; FA = 20; matrix = 276 × 319; slice thickness = 1 mm; FOV = 220 mm × 220 mm. SWI used 3D gradient echo (GRE) sequence. Diffusional tensor imaging (DTI): TR = 3000 mm; TE = 100; slice thickness = 2.5 mm; gap = 0; b-values = 0 and 1000s/mm ; diffusion gradient directions = 32; matrix = 128 × 128; FOV = 256 mm × 256 mm. 


### Image processing 
  
Data Processing & Analysis for Resting-State Brain Imaging (DPABI_V2.3_170105) with the following stages was applied for data analysis (Yan et al.  ). The first 10 volumes were discarded and the remaining 230 consecutive volumes were used for data analysis. Afterwards, slice-timing adjustment and realignment for head motion correction were performed. mTBI and healthy control participant who had a head motion greater than 3.0 mm or a rotation in the x, y, or z directions higher than 3.0◦ were excluded. Data were spatial normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template (resampling voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm ) and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) to increase signal-to-noise ratio. 

Functional connectivity was analyzed using the REST software. To examine functional connectivity for sub-regions of insula, six spherical 6 mm radius seeds were defined centered on the coordinates for each ROI in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI 152) space which was showed on Fig.  , including: left ventral anterior insula (L-vAI, red, MNI = − 33, 13, − 7), right ventral anterior insula (R-vAI, orange, MNI = 32, 10, − 6), left dorsal anterior insula (L-dAI, green, MNI = − 38, 6, 2), right dorsal anterior insula (R-dAI, purple, MNI = 35, 7, 3), left posterior insula (L-PI, blue, MNI = − 38, − 6, 5) and right posterior insula (R-PI, pink, MNI = 35, − 11, 6)(Peng et al.  ). These coordinates of insular sub-regions seeds were reported previously(Deen et al.  ). The mean time series of each ROI was acquired for reference time course. Then, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were computed between the mean signal change of each ROI and the time series of each voxel. Functional connectivity was computed between each insular subregion seed and all vertices on the whole brain surface space for each participant. The Fisher’s r-to-z transformed correlation map was then averaged within each group for each seed region to generate the mean functional connectivity distribution (Peng et al.  ). 

  
The sub-regions of insula were shown, including: left ventral anterior insula (L-vAI, red), right ventral anterior insula (R-vAI, orange), left dorsal anterior insula (L-dAI, green), right dorsal anterior insula (R-dAI, purple), left posterior insula (L-PI, blue) and right posterior insula (R-PI, pink) 
  


### Statistical analysis 
  
To investigate the abnormal functional connectivity between the patients with acute mild traumatic brain injury and healthy controls, two-sample t-test for each seed region was estimated. Then, surface-based cluster-wise correction for multiple comparisons was performed at the significance threshold of p < 0.001 and the cluster size threshold of 13 mm , which was determined by Monte Carlo. For a follow-up analysis, we investigated the relationship between fMRI data and MoCA scores in acute mTBI patients. Pearson’s correlation analyses were performed in a voxel-wise manner using REST software. The statistical threshold was set at corrected p < 0.001 using the same parameters as the group comparison analysis. 

Differences in demographic data between mTBI patients and healthy controls were analyzed using between-group t-test for means and two-test for proportions. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant, corrected for age, sex and years of education. Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons in the correlation analyses. 



## Results 
  
During the study period, 78 patients with the diagnosis of mTBI after head injury (range, 0–10 days, average, 2.95 days) were recruited. Among these patients, 25 participants were excluded due to pre-existing neurological or psychiatric disease (n = 05), previous head injury (n = 02), dental appliance (n = 05), image artifact (n = 04), or excess head movement (n = 09). The remaining 53 patients were finally analyzed. 37 age, gender and education level matched healthy control participants were also recruited in this study. No significant difference existed in age (P = 0.149), gender (P = 0.138), education level (P = 0.098) and GCS score for both groups. Table   is a summary of the basic demographic characteristics of mTBI group and healthy control group. No visible traumatic brain lesions were seen on conventional imaging such as T2 or susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI).

## Discussion 
  
We have previously observed that the functional connectivity of a.i. with other brain regions is impaired in mTBI patients during the acute stage (Li et al.  ; Lu et al.  ). However, the connectivity patterns of insula subdivisions to other brain regions within mTBI patients as compared to healthy controls have not been further studied. In this study, we not only found that insular sub-regions were abnormally connected with regions of the superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and hippocampus but also found correlation between MoCA sub-scores and functional connectivity of insular subdivisions. These findings may shed new light to understand the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment following acute mTBI. Clinically, these features which show more accurate and comprehensive information may serve as objective biomarkers to achieve clinically-relevant capabilities for the diagnosis and treatment of mTBI, finally to improve the prognosis of mTBI. 


## Insula-Hippocampal connectivity 
  
In our study, the patients with mTBI presented decreased functional connectivity between the right vAI and right hippocampus. We also find in the literature examples where TBI patients exhibit smaller hippocampal volumes when compared to controls (Monti et al.  ; Zhang et al.  ; Sampedro et al.  ). These results can be explained by the fact that hippocampus is believed disproportionately affected by mTBI because it is located in the medial temporal lobe of brain, which makes it more vulnerable to impact forces (Monti et al.  ). Further, it is also particularly susceptible to excitotoxic injury, which often occurs in TBI. In addition to moderate and severe TBI, mTBI also could induce diffused hippocampal neuronal damages and apoptosis (Monti et al.  ; Spielberg et al.  ). And hippocampal neurodegeration in patients with mTBI linked to cognitive function decline is reported by previous studies (Monti et al.  ; Zuo et al.  ). However, the present analysis did not show any functional connectivity between the insula and hippocampus was significantly correlated with the MoCA score. Such inconsistency can be only partially explained by differences in the parameters used for image acquisition, the procedures used for data processing and analysis, and small sample sizes. 


## Insula-Frontal connectivity 
  
Compared to healthy controls, the current findings showed decreased functional connectivity between the insula and frontal gyrus in patients with mTBI, which is consistent with the fact that insula functionally connected with adjacent frontal regions. In many previous research, reduced neural activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, middle and superior frontal gyrus were found in mTBI (Iaria et al.  ; Wang et al.  ). One previous fMRI meta-analysis demonstrated a reason of a frontal vulnerability to mTBI, compared to controls (Eierud et al.  ). The frontal lobes, which participate in frontal-subcortical circuits, play a critical role in cognitive function (Iaria et al.  ). Meanwhile, our study demonstrated the functional connectivity between the insula and frontal gyrus had a significantly positive correlation with MoCA sub-scores including the orientation and abstraction scores. That is, the lower the functional connectivity, the lower the MoCA score. The mTBI possibly have damage on the frontal-subcortical circuits or white matter tracts, thereby inducing cognitive impairment. Compared with other domains of MoCA, orientation and abstraction are the cognitive processes found often to be affected after injury. Furthermore, abstract thinking was the most affected and showed minimal improvement at the time of discharge, but orientation showed maximum improvement. In fact, the parietal gyrus mainly controls the orientation function, and the frontal gyrus functionally and structurally connects with the parietal gyrus. Therefore, frontal gyrus affects the orientation and abstraction scores may via the relationship with the parietal gyrus. More related studies must be performed in the future. 


## Insula-Temporal connectivity 
  
In our data, the insula was found to be negatively connected with temporal gyrus, which matches the fact of a strong projection between the insula and temporal gyrus. Previous literature reported volume loss of gray matter in the temporal gyrus in mTBI (Babcock et al.  ; Wang et al.  ). Unsurprisingly, we observed decreased functional connectivity between the insula and temporal gyrus in patients with mTBI, compared with control group. As noted above, the frontal gyrus and the temporal gyrus play an important role in a variety of cognitive functions. These brain areas are also known to be the site of the pathophysiological foundations of cognitive impairment caused by the early stages of the disease. Moreover, previous literature found notable accumulations of amyloid in the temporal gyrus in patients who sufferer with significant cognitive dysfunction which suggests partial reason why temporal gyrus is related to cognitive performance (Mohamed et al.  ). In addition, our study showed positive correlations between functional connectivity of insula and temporal gyrus and orientation score. In fact, orientation function is mainly charged by the parietal gyrus, the relationship between the insula or the temporal gyrus and orientation function is unclear. We presumed that the orientation function was affected by the insula or the temporal gyrus via the parietal gyrus because the posterior superior part of temporal gyrus is connected with parietal gyrus. However, the relationship between the temporal gyrus and parietal gyrus in acute mTBI patients must be further investigated. 


## Limitations 
  
There existed a number of limitations in our study. First, this study is limited to homogeneity in research populations of mTBI patients with different injury mechanisms and various brain injury sites. Second, GCS score was used to identify the severity of head injury. However, duration of loss of consciousness as an injury index is not considerable for most mTBI patients. Finally, this study only investigated functional connectivity dysfunction of insula subdivisions with other cortical regions at the acute stage, sub-acute and chronic data are necessary to improve to understand the development of damage and recovery. It may be important in future work. 


## Conclusions 
  
Taken together, our current and past work suggest that patients with acute mTBI suffer from functional connectivity dysfunction of insula subdivisions with other cortical regions including the hippocampus, frontal gyrus and temporal gyrus in comparison with healthy controls. Additionally, these patients showed significantly positive correlations between function connectivity of insula with above regions and cognitive performance.

# Abstract
 
Using fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis, we determined whether spectral and temporal acoustic features are represented by independent or integrated multivoxel codes in human cortex. Listeners heard band-pass noise varying in frequency (spectral) and amplitude-modulation (AM) rate (temporal) features. In the superior temporal plane, changes in multivoxel activity due to frequency were largely invariant with respect to AM rate (and vice versa), consistent with an independent representation. In contrast, in posterior parietal cortex, multivoxel representation was exclusively integrated and tuned to specific conjunctions of frequency and AM features (albeit weakly). Direct between-region comparisons show that whereas independent coding of frequency weakened with increasing levels of the hierarchy, such a progression for AM and integrated coding was less fine-grained and only evident in the higher hierarchical levels from non-core to parietal cortex (with AM coding weakening and integrated coding strengthening). Our findings support the notion that primary auditory cortex can represent spectral and temporal acoustic features in an independent fashion and suggest a role for parietal cortex in feature integration and the structuring of sensory input.

## Introduction 
  
In structuring the auditory scene, the brain must carry out two fundamental computations. First, it must derive   independent   representations of component acoustic features so that task-relevant features can be prioritized and task-irrelevant ones ignored. Second, to solve the well-known “binding problem”, the brain must subsequently   integrate   these separated representations into a coherent whole so that the features of a relevant sound source can be tracked successfully in cluttered scenes. Whether representations of stimulus features are independent or integrated is a longstanding issue in psychology ( ;  ) and neuroscience ( ;  ). Even when not explicitly framed using these terms, many questions concerning sensory systems can be formalized in terms of representational independence versus integration ( ). 

It is widely believed that auditory processing is hierarchically organized and that neural representations are progressively transformed from independent to integrated codes as sensory information ascends the auditory pathway ( ;  ). Thus, while neurons in low-level regions might respond to single stimulus features, higher-level neurons should show more complex tuning properties and respond to conjunctions of features. Precisely where along this continuum human primary auditory cortex (and regions beyond) fit within this conception of the auditory system has been the subject of debate. 

Based on presumed similarities with the visual system, early models proposed that representations in primary auditory cortex were primarily independent, instantiated as topographically organized “feature maps” (see  ). According to such accounts, the integration of features is a computation that should most reliably be observed in non-primary regions. However, animal physiology studies demonstrate highly nonlinear neural responses already at the level of primary auditory cortex, suggestive of an integrated coding scheme ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The extent to which this also applies in humans remains unclear. While there are many sources of human imaging evidence that are potentially relevant to this issue, particularly investigations of how low-level acoustic features and higher-level categories are represented in cortical activity ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), fewer studies have directly tested and quantified the extent of representational independence versus integration in human cortex. 

In the current study, we used fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis to determine the extent to which spectral and temporal acoustic features are represented by independent or integrated multivoxel codes and how those codes are expressed over the human cortical hierarchy. Participants listened to band-pass noise varying across stimuli in frequency (a spectrally-based feature) and amplitude modulation (AM) rate (temporally-based; see  A). We chose to investigate these two acoustic features as they are sufficient alone to characterize much of the information present in biologically important sounds such as speech ( ;  ). An approach based on MANOVA ( ) allowed us to estimate the independent contributions of frequency and AM features to the observed multivoxel patterns, as opposed to nonlinear interactions between the features that are a signature of integrated coding ( ;  ). Moreover, by acquiring whole-brain fMRI, we were able to characterize multivoxel representations across the entire human cortex, in contrast to more localized physiological recordings in animals.   
A) Spectrograms of the nine stimuli, with the spectrogram frequency axis equally spaced on a scale of Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB;  ) and smoothed to obtain a temporal resolution similar to the Equivalent Rectangular Duration ( ). This depiction more accurately captures spectral representation in the ascending auditory system than a spectrogram with a linear frequency axis. Note that the carrier frequencies of the presented stimuli were equally spaced on a logarithmic (rather than ERB) scale. The cyan- and magenta-colored text above each spectrogram indicate the center carrier frequency and AM rate of the bandpass noise, respectively.

From these three contrasts, we could test for independent and integrated coding (see Methods section for details).

## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Twenty participants (eleven female), aged between 18 and 27 years (mean ​= ​23, SD ​= ​2.4), were tested after being informed of the study’s procedure, which was approved by the research ethics committee of University College London. All reported normal hearing, normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and had no history of neurological disorders. Our sample size is in line with (or exceeds that of) related studies with   a priori   unknown effect sizes (e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ). While recent methods work recommends larger sample sizes for (univariate) fMRI studies ( ;  ), we note that this recommendation was made in the context of more complex cognitive paradigms each lasting around 10 ​min. Thus, both cross- and within-participant variability might be expected to be greater than for the simpler sensory paradigm employed here conducted over a longer scanning time of 50 ​min (for a discussion of the trade-off between sample size and scan duration, see  ). 


### Stimuli 
  
The stimulus consisted of narrow (third of an octave) bandpass noise, amplitude modulated sinusoidally with 80% depth (see  A). Each sound was presented for 1 ​s and varied across trials in center carrier frequency (from hereon, “frequency”) and amplitude modulation rate (“AM”). Frequency (500, 1300 and 3380 ​Hz) and AM (4, 10 and 25 ​Hz) were equally spaced on a logarithmic scale. Importantly for the purpose of assessing independent and integrated feature coding (see First-level statistics section below), frequency and AM varied across stimuli in an orthogonal fashion, such that every frequency was paired with every AM (i.e. nine stimuli in total, arranged as a 3 ​× ​3 factorial design). The relatively slow AM rates precluded the perception of pitch associated with the temporal modulation. In addition, the carrier center frequencies and bandwidths were chosen to avoid detectable spectral cues from resolved sidebands in the stimulus ( ). Sidebands will be most detectable for sounds with fast AM rates and low carrier frequencies ( ). In the current study, this corresponds to the stimulus with the 500 ​Hz carrier frequency and 25 ​Hz AM rate. However, the sidebands resulting from this stimulus (500 ​+ ​25 ​= ​525 ​Hz and 500–25 ​= ​475 ​Hz) fall inside the auditory filter centered at 500 ​Hz with an equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB) of 79 ​Hz ( ). 

Stimuli were matched in terms of their RMS amplitude and shaped with 20 ​ms raised-cosine onset and offset ramps. Bandpass noise was synthesized independently on each presentation (with a sampling rate of 44,100 ​Hz) and delivered diotically through MRI-compatible insert earphones (S14, Sensimetrics Corporation). To compensate for resonances in the frequency response of the earphones, the stimuli were digitally preprocessed using the filters and software provided with the earphones. 


### Procedure 
  
Stimulus delivery was controlled with Cogent toolbox ( ) in Matlab (MathWorks). Participants were scanned for five runs, each lasting around 10 ​min consisting of sixteen repetitions of the nine stimuli. For one participant, there was insufficient time to scan for the fifth run because of technical difficulties. Stimuli were grouped into blocks of eighteen sounds within which all nine stimuli appeared twice and in random order. The inter-stimulus interval ranged uniformly between 2000 and 4000 ​ms. 

Participants were instructed to listen carefully to the sounds while looking at a central fixation cross and press a button (with their right hand) each time a brief (150 ​ms duration) white-noise interruption occurred during sound presentation. These white-noise interruptions were unmodulated in their amplitude profile and occurred on a small percentage (~6%) of stimuli (once every block of eighteen sounds). Group performance was near ceiling, confirming engagement with the task. The average hit rate was .98 (ranging from 0.8 to 1 across participants; SEM ​= ​0.014) with no false alarms. 

To estimate the perceived saliency of the sounds, two participants from the main fMRI experiment and four new participants (two female; mean age ​= ​29 years, SD ​= ​4) completed a short behavioral session similar in procedure to  . These participants listened to all pairwise combinations of the nine sounds (eight pairs for each of the nine sounds; separated by 200 ​ms of silence) and were asked to judge on each trial which of the two sounds was more salient. Participants were told that saliency refers to how much a sound would grab their attention. Pairs were presented three times in random order, with the order of the sounds within a pair counterbalanced across trials. 

To estimate perceived loudness, we used the loudness model of  , as implemented in Matlab ( ). As the model output differs slightly for different noise samples of the same stimulus, we generated an entire (single-participant) stimulus set in the same way as was done for the main experiment which we submitted to the model. We computed the time-varying long-term loudness, averaged over the duration of the stimulus and across noise samples for each of the nine stimuli. 


### Image acquisition 
  
Imaging data were collected on a Siemens 3 ​T Quattro MRI scanner ( ) at the Wellcome Trust Center for Human NeuroImaging, University College London. A total of 175 echo planar imaging (EPI) volumes were acquired per run, using a 32-channel head coil and continuous sequence (TR ​= ​3.36 ​s; TE ​= ​30 ​ms; 48 slices covering the whole brain; 3 ​mm isotropic resolution; matrix size ​= ​64 ​× ​74; echo spacing ​= ​0.5 ​ms; orientation ​= ​transverse). After the third run, field maps were acquired (short TE ​= ​10 ​ms; long TE ​= ​12.46 ​ms). During the functional scans, we also obtained physiological measures of each participant’s breathing and cardiac pulse. Because of technical issues, physiological measures were not available for two participants. The experimental session concluded with the acquisition of a high-resolution (1 ​× ​1 ​× ​1 ​mm) T1-weighted structural MRI scan. 

The randomized presentation order of the nine stimuli was employed to sensitively detect between-stimulus differences in BOLD signal ( ). However, our experimental design also permitted detection of sound versus implicit baseline as we randomized the ISIs uniformly between 2 and 4 ​s (equivalent to 3–5 ​s stimulus onset asynchrony). Although this stimulus timing is fast relative to the duration of the haemodynamic response function (which peaks around 5 ​s), the randomization of ISIs sufficiently enabled the detection of BOLD signal variations relating to sound versus baseline. This is confirmed by inspection of the predicted BOLD timeseries and by the parameter estimates in superior temporal plane regions, which were reliably greater than baseline (shown in  ).

### Image processing 
  
fMRI analysis was performed in SPM12 ( ). After discarding the first three volumes to allow for magnetic saturation effects, the remaining images were realigned and unwarped to the first volume to correct for movement of participants during scanning. Also at the unwarping stage, the acquired field maps were used to correct for geometric distortions in the EPI due to magnetic field variations. Realigned images were co-registered to the mean functional image and then subjected to multivariate statistical analysis, generating searchlight maps from unsmoothed data in each participant’s native space (see First-level statistics section below). Searchlight maps were subsequently normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template image using the parameters from the segmentation of the structural image (resampled resolution: 2 ​× ​2 ​× ​2 ​mm) and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 ​mm full-width at half-maximum. Where additional univariate analyses are reported, realigned images were spatially normalized and smoothed first before statistical analysis. 


### First-level statistics 
  
Statistical analysis was based on the general linear model (GLM) of each participant’s fMRI time series, using a 1/128 ​s highpass filter and AR1 correction for auto-correlation. The design matrix comprised the auditory stimulus events, each modeled as a stick (delta) function and convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function. Separate columns were specified for each of the nine stimuli, in addition to a column for target sounds (to remove variance associated with the white noise interruptions and the button presses). Additional columns were specified for the six movement parameters and the mean of each run. Cardiac and respiratory phase (including their aliased harmonics) as well as heart rate and respiratory volume were modeled using an in-house Matlab toolbox ( ). This resulted in fourteen physiological regressors in total: six each for cardiac and respiratory phase and one each for heart rate and respiratory volume. 

For statistical inference, we used cross-validated multivariate analysis of variance ( ), as implemented in the cvMANOVA toolbox in Matlab (version 3;  ). For each participant, this method measures the pattern distinctness D, a cross-validated version of one of the standard multivariate statistics: Lawley-Hotelling’s trace. 

Lawley-Hotelling’s trace (  Δ  ) quantifies the amount of multivariate variance explainable by an experimental contrast, in units of error variance: where   B   are the parameter contrasts,   X   is the design matrix and   ∑   is the error covariance matrix. The pattern distinctness D is derived by additionally cross-validating the data using a leave-one-run-out procedure (for further details, see  ). Cross-validation ensures that the expected value of D is zero if two voxel patterns are not statistically different from each other, making D a suitable summary statistic for group-level inference (e.g. with the one-sample   t  -test). Note that because of this cross-validation, D can sometimes be negative if its true value is close to zero in the presence of noise. 

In contrast to classification accuracy from pattern decoders, which is dependent on the particular algorithm used as well as the amount of data and partitioning into training and test sets, D is a clearly interpretable, standardized effect size (for examples of previous applications, see  ;  ,  ;  ). When applied to the simple case of only two stimuli, D is a measure of between-stimulus pattern dissimilarity and is closely related to the (cross-validated) Mahalanobis distance, which has been demonstrated to be a more reliable and accurate metric for characterizing multivoxel patterns than the correlation or Euclidean distance ( ;  ;  ). Like the Mahalanobis distance, D takes into account the spatial structure of the noise (GLM residuals) by normalizing the multivoxel variation for an experimental effect by the noise covariance between voxels. As D is obtained from the GLM, cvMANOVA can also be used to test more complex contrasts such as the main effects and interactions of a factorial design. For the 3 ​× ​3 design of the present study, the contrast matrices for the two main effects and interaction take the standard form ( ) and are shown in  B. 

We tested the extent to which frequency and AM features are represented by independent or integrated multivoxel codes by examining three effects of interest. If frequency and AM features are represented in an integrated fashion, then changes in these two features should combine nonlinearly (non-additively) to influence multivoxel activity patterns (see  ;  ). In other words, the effect of frequency should differ depending on AM (and vice versa). Thus, the first effect of interest was the interaction between frequency and AM and quantified the extent of integrated coding. If on the other hand, frequency and AM features are coded independently, then changes in these two features should result in a linear (additive) effect on activity patterns. An independent effect implies that changes in voxel patterns attributable to the frequency feature remain invariant with respect to AM (and vice versa): there is no interaction. Within the cvMANOVA framework, the extent of independence can therefore be quantified by subtracting the interaction from the main effects as follows (see equation 19 in  ): where   D(Freq)  ,   D(AM)   and   D(Interaction)   are the pattern distinctness estimates for the main effects of frequency, AM and the interaction, respectively.   L(Freq)   and   L(AM)   are the number of levels for the frequency and AM factors, respectively (for the current design,   L(Freq)   ​= ​  L(AM)   ​= ​3).   expressed such contrasts as measures of “pattern stability” but are equivalently considered measures of independent coding ( ). 

Computational simulations confirm that the above effects of interest capture the presence of independent and integrated representations, in line with previous modeling work and applications in the visual and motor domains ( ;  ). For each of twenty “participants” and nine stimuli, we generated synthetic activity patterns over 123 voxels consisting of the true underlying pattern (normal random vector) and a noise component that was generated independently for each of five “runs” and sixteen repetitions of the nine stimuli. These synthetic data were then submitted to cvMANOVA resulting in a pattern distinctness estimate for each participant and effect of interest. 

Two versions of the simulation were run, differing in the generative model used to produce the voxel patterns. In the first version, frequency and AM features were represented independently. That is, voxel patterns were generated separately for the two features and summed together to obtain voxel patterns (Y) for each of the nine stimuli with carrier center frequency f and AM rate m: where   F   and   T   denote, respectively, the voxel pattern representations for the frequency and AM features and e the noise. 

In the second version, frequency and AM were represented in an integrated fashion by generating a unique pattern for each of the nine stimuli. Thus, in this version of the simulation, the representation of frequency is inseparable from that of AM: Here   FT   denotes the true pattern that was generated uniquely for each stimulus. In both versions, the resulting patterns were scaled to have the same mean and variance. 

In the present version of the simulations, the variance of the noise was set to 10 times that of the true underlying pattern. We could vary this ratio to modulate the overall effect sizes in the simulations and to match those observed in the experimental data. However, our goal here was not to recreate the precise conditions of the experiment. This would require modeling the spatiotemporal correlation of within-subject noise and cross-subject variability, which is outside the scope of the current study. Rather, through the use of a generative model, we wished to provide a more formal definition of independent and integrated coding. In addition, we wished to confirm that   in principle  , our experimental contrasts can indeed capture independent and integrated coding in the specific context of our 3 ​× ​3 factorial design. For more detailed simulations that validate the current methods, see   and  . 

As  C shows, when frequency and AM were simulated as independent representations, the pattern distinctness D was significantly greater than zero when testing the independent (but not integrated) coding effects of interest (frequency:   t  (19) ​= ​29.2,   p   ​< ​.001; AM:   t  (19) ​= ​35.1,   p   ​< ​.001; Integrated:   t  (19) ​= ​−0.104,   p   ​= ​.541). In contrast, when frequency and AM were represented in an integrated fashion, the reverse was true with a significant effect of integrated (but not independent) coding (frequency:   t  (19) ​= ​−1.39,   p   ​= ​.910; AM:   t  (19) ​= ​−0.429, p ​= ​.664; Integrated:   t  (19) ​= ​33.0,   p   ​< ​.001). This pattern of results was supported by a repeated measures ANOVA in which we observed a significant two-way interaction between simulation type (independent versus integrated) and effect of interest (frequency/AM/integrated;   F  (2,30) ​= ​737.2,   p   ​< ​.001). 

cvMANOVA was performed as a searchlight analysis ( ) using spheres with a radius of three voxels (~9 ​mm; ~123 voxels of 3 ​× ​3 ​× ​3 ​mm) and constrained to voxels within the whole-brain mask generated by SPM during model estimation. This whole-brain mask does not explicitly exclude white matter voxels but inspection of the overlap with a probabilistic white matter mask revealed no overlap with high probability (>80%) white matter voxels. Moreover, the noise normalization performed by cvMANOVA should in principle automatically downweight noise from white matter voxels, circumventing the need to explicitly distinguish between gray and white matter. Thus, for each participant and effect of interest, a whole-brain searchlight image was generated in which each voxel expressed the pattern distinctness D over that voxel and the surrounding neighborhood. As recommended by  , to correct for searchlight spheres near the brain mask boundaries containing fewer voxels, the estimate of D at each voxel was adjusted by dividing by the square root of the number of voxels within the searchlight. 


### Group-level statistics 
  
For whole-cortex statistical analysis of the multivariate data, searchlight images were submitted to a group-level one-sample   t  -test under minimal assumptions using the nonparametric permutation test ( ). In this procedure, the sign of the pattern distinctness at each voxel for each subject was randomly flipped. The one-sample   t  -statistic was subsequently computed at each voxel, the image thresholded and the largest cluster size noted. By repeating these steps over a number of iterations (here 5000), we could build a null distribution of cluster sizes against which to compare the observed cluster size at each voxel. Note that because the true pattern distinctness can never be negative, a one-sample   t  -test in this context effectively provides fixed-effect inference ( ). This is similar to   t  -tests on classification accuracies, the true values of which can never be below chance. Whole-cortex statistics for the univariate analysis were also based on the permutation test. Here we used a one-sample   t  -test for comparing sound-evoked activation with the implicit baseline and repeated measures ANOVA with the factors frequency and AM to test between-stimulus differences. When using ANOVA, the null distribution was created by randomly shuffling the nine stimulus labels. We constrained all analyses to voxels within the cortex (as defined by the probabilistic Harvard-Oxford cortical mask thresholded at 25%, distributed with FslView  ). Statistical maps were thresholded voxelwise at   p   ​< ​.005 and clusterwise at   p   ​< ​.05 (familywise error [FWE] corrected for multiple comparisons). 

Additional region of interest (ROI) analyses were conducted by averaging over the searchlight and univariate contrast images in locations anatomically defined by the Jülich and Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlases (distributed with FslView) and thresholded at 30%. This ROI analysis was conducted parametrically (i.e. without using the permutation test). The ROIs included primary auditory cortex (area Te1.0 in middle Heschl’s gyrus [HG]) and the non-primary auditory areas Te1.1 (posteromedial HG), Te1.2 (anterolateral HG), planum polare (PP) and planum temporale (PT). We also tested the posterior parietal region revealed in the whole-cortex searchlight analysis, to enable a comparison of effect size with the auditory cortical ROIs and to statistically test for between-region differences. To avoid statistical “double-dipping” ( ), we used a leave-one-subject-out procedure ( ) in which the whole-cortex second level   t  -test was repeatedly re-estimated, each time leaving out one participant, and using the resulting left parietal cluster as the ROI for the left out subject (cluster defining threshold   p   ​< ​.005 uncorrected). To obtain the homologous cluster in the right hemisphere, each left parietal cluster was left-right flipped using MarsBaR toolbox for SPM ( ). This enabled us to statistically compare effects in parietal cortex with those in the superior temporal plane ROIs (which were distributed in both hemispheres). To reduce computation time, these leave-one-subject-out   t  -tests were also conducted parametrically in SPM. To facilitate interpretation, ROI effect sizes for the multivariate analysis are reported after transforming the adjusted pattern distinctness back into the original estimate (by multiplying by a constant factor of √123 i.e. the typical number of voxels within each searchlight). 

Classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) was performed on single-participant dissimilarity matrices in selected ROIs. The resulting MDS solutions were averaged over participants after Procrustes alignment to account for the arbitrary rotation induced by the MDS procedure. Because Procrustes alignment potentially removes some of the true inter-individual differences, the standard error ellipses in  B should be considered a lower-bound estimate of cross-participant variability ( ). To further visualize the dissimilarity relationships, we subjected the dissimilarity matrices to an agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure (based on complete-linkage) and visualized the results with dendrograms (see  ). Dissimilarity matrices were formed by computing the pattern distinctness of all pairwise comparison contrasts between the nine stimuli and subjected to a group-level one-sample   t  -test. Given that the goal of this analysis was to better visualize effects of interest already identified as significant (i.e. the independent and integrated contrasts in the whole-cortex and ROI analyses), we thresholded these dissimilarity matrices at   p   ​< ​.05 uncorrected. 



## Results 
  
### Cortical distribution of independent and integrated codes 
  
We used cross-validated MANOVA ( ) to determine the extent to which cortical activity patterns show evidence for 1) independent coding of frequency, in which the influence of frequency was invariant with respect to AM, 2) independent coding of AM, in which the influence of AM was invariant with frequency or 3) integrated coding, in which the influences of frequency and AM were interdependent. This was achieved by testing whether the pattern distinctness D over a searchlight sphere or ROI was significantly above zero for the independent and integrated effects of interest (see First-level statistics in the Methods section). 

Using a whole-cortex searchlight analysis ( ), we detected large clusters in the superior temporal plane bilaterally (extending into the superior temporal gyrus) that showed significant independent coding of frequency and AM ( A and  ). Within these regions of auditory cortex, there was no evidence for integrated coding after correcting for multiple comparisons over the whole cortex. Instead, significant integrated coding was observed in a cluster outside of classically defined auditory cortex in the left posterior parietal lobe, extending over the inferior and superior portions of the parietal lobule and the intraparietal sulcus.

We next conducted an ROI analysis in which independent and integrated coding was tested in anatomically defined regions in the superior temporal plane as well as the posterior parietal region identified in the whole-cortex searchlight analysis. We first tested each ROI separately, using false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons across 6 ROIs x 2 hemispheres x 3 effects of interest ( ). As expected from the earlier whole-cortex analysis, significant independent coding of both frequency and AM was observed in all auditory ROIs but not in posterior parietal cortex (shown in  B). The effect size for independent coding of AM (mean D ​= ​0.02–0.04 over auditory regions) was smaller than for frequency, amounting to no more than 8% of the frequency effect size (mean D ​= ​0.5–1.0). Also expected was significant integrated coding in the left posterior parietal ROI. However, additional effects of integrated coding were observed in right primary auditory cortex (area Te1.0), right anterolateral auditory area Te1.2 and right PT. The effect size for integrated coding (mean D ​= ​0.01–0.02 over right Te1.0, Te1.2, PT and left parietal) was considerably smaller than that for independent coding (50% of the AM effect size and no more than 4% of the frequency effect size). 

Thus, the ROI analysis above suggests that in the superior temporal plane, cortical activation patterns show a mixture of components: a strong independent code and a weak integrated code. In contrast in parietal cortex, only an integrated code is present. In support of this pattern of results, we conducted repeated measures ANOVA with representation type (frequency/AM/integrated), region (primary/nonprimary/parietal) and hemisphere as factors. We observed a significant interaction between representation type and region (  F  (4,76) ​= ​154,   p   ​< ​.001). No factors involving hemisphere were significant and so in subsequent comparisons, we averaged the data over hemispheres. To further characterize the representation type by region interaction, we separately assessed how the magnitude of independent and integrated coding changed along successive stages of the cortical hierarchy. For independent coding of frequency, there was a significant decrease in pattern distinctness in non-primary versus primary auditory cortex (  t  (19) ​= ​−12.2,   p   ​< ​.001). This was also the case for parietal versus non-primary auditory cortex (  t  (19) ​= ​−11.8,   p   ​< ​.001). The pattern was less clear-cut for independent coding of AM and integrated coding. Like the results for the frequency feature, there was a significant decrease in independent coding of AM in parietal versus non-primary auditory cortex (  t  (19) ​= ​−7.67,   p   ​< ​.001). However, the equivalent comparison for non-primary versus primary auditory cortex was not significant (  t  (19) ​= ​−1.21,   p   ​= ​.120). For integrated coding, there was an increase in parietal versus non-primary auditory cortex (  t  (19) ​= ​1.82,   p   ​< ​.05). However, there was no significant difference between non-primary and primary auditory regions (  t  (19) ​= ​−0.797,   p   ​= ​.218). In summary, although there was a clear and fine-grained change across hierarchical levels in the strength of frequency coding (primary vs. non-primary auditory cortex, non-primary auditory vs. parietal cortex), such a change for AM and integrated coding was less fine-grained and only evident in the higher hierarchical levels (non-primary vs. parietal cortex). 

Additional univariate analyses were conducted which were focused on the strength of activation. As expected, at the whole-cortex level, sound presentation was associated with increased BOLD responses in the superior temporal plane bilaterally ( A and  ). No significant sound-evoked activations were observed in parietal cortex. Using repeated measures ANOVA (with frequency and AM as factors), we also evaluated between-stimulus differences in activation. Note that the main effects of frequency and AM for this analysis are conceptually different to the independent coding effects of the multivariate analysis. Here the main effect of frequency, for example, simply captures activation differences attributable to this factor rather than quantifying the extent of frequency invariance when AM rate changes. We observed significant effects of frequency and AM in the superior temporal plane bilaterally that survived whole-cortex testing but no significant frequency ​× ​AM interaction ( A and  ). When conducting this analysis in the ROIs (shown in  B), main effects of frequency and AM were present in auditory cortical regions but not in parietal cortex (FDR corrected as before, across 6 ROIs x 2 hemispheres x 3 effects of interest). Consistent with previous work (see  ;  ), follow-up   t  -tests in ROIs showing main effects showed a low carrier frequency preference in areas Te1.0 and Te1.2 bilaterally (all   p  ’s ​< ​0.001) and a high carrier frequency preference in right Te1.1 (  t  (19) ​= ​3.46,   p   ​< ​.01). For the main effect of AM, the preference was for slow modulation rates throughout (all   p  ’s ​< ​0.01; consistent with data from  ). No significant interaction between frequency and AM was observed in any of the ROIs tested (even with an uncorrected threshold).

### Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis 
  
Having established the cortical distribution of independent and integrated codes, we next used classical MDS to further characterize those codes ( ). In three selected ROIs (right Te1.0, right PT and left parietal), we computed the pattern distinctness for all pairs of stimuli and assembled the results into dissimilarity matrices. These ROIs were chosen as together they fully sample the transition from auditory core to non-core to parietal cortex and show a mixture of independent and integrated coding profiles. As shown in  A, we first averaged the matrices over participants and thresholded them based on a group-level one-sample   t  -test (see  ). Given that we were interested in further characterizing independent and integrated effects previously shown as significant, we used an uncorrected   p   ​< ​.05 threshold. MDS was performed to project the multivoxel dissimilarity structure onto a simple two-dimensional space ( B). In this visualization, stimuli that are close together are associated with similar multivoxel activation patterns while stimuli that are far from each other are associated with dissimilar patterns. 

In right primary auditory cortex (area Te1.0) and right PT, frequency and AM features were automatically projected by the MDS solution onto separate dimensions, despite the method having no information as to the stimulus features. Frequency was carried by the first MDS dimension (shown as the x-axis in  B) while AM was carried by the second dimension (y-axis). This is consistent with our previous observation of these regions representing frequency and AM in a largely independent manner. 

In contrast to auditory cortex, MDS for the left parietal ROI did not clearly separate frequency and AM features. The MDS solutions instead suggest that activation patterns in this region were modulated by particular conjunctions of carrier frequency and AM rate (e.g. F500AM10 and F3380AM25). This is again consistent with our previous observation that parietal cortex is characterized solely by an integrated code. 

Visual inspection of the MDS plots in superior temporal regions suggests that carrier frequency was the main driver of multivoxel pattern dissimilarity. That is, multivoxel patterns were most dissimilar when evoked by different carrier frequencies. Indeed, hierarchical clustering analysis showed that multivoxel dissimilarities clearly clustered according to carrier frequency in right Te1.0 and PT ( C). In contrast in the left parietal ROI, this analysis failed to reveal a clear clustering. These results are consistent with the effect sizes for independent and integrated coding shown previously in  B. 


### Saliency analysis 
  
In the visual domain, parietal cortex has repeatedly been implicated in the processing of bottom-up saliency ( ;  ). We therefore asked to what extent the integrated coding effect observed in posterior parietal cortex could be explained by between-stimulus differences in perceived saliency. In a separate behavioral session, listeners listened to all pairwise combinations of the nine sounds and judged which sound in each pair was more salient. We then estimated the perceived saliency of each sound as the percentage of trials the sound was chosen as more salient (shown in  A as thick black line). Because saliency is related (although not identical) to loudness ( ), we also show for comparison the loudness of the stimuli as predicted by the model of   (shown in  A as thick blue line).   
Saliency analysis. A) Subjective saliency of the stimuli. The thick black line indicates the group-averaged percentage of trials each stimulus was judged as more salient (than the other stimuli). Light gray lines indicate saliency judgements for individual participants. The thick blue line represents the predicted loudness of the stimuli according to the model of   and normalized to have the same scale as the saliency data (for display purposes only). B) “Saliency distance” matrix expressing the absolute difference in the percentage of observations each sound in a pair was chosen as more salient. C) Whole-cortex multivariate searchlight analysis, showing where the Fisher transformed Spearman correlation between the saliency distance matrix in panel B and the multivoxel dissimilarity structure in each searchlight was significantly above zero across participants (thresholded voxelwise at   p   ​< ​.005 and clusterwise at   p   ​< ​.05 FWE corrected for multiple comparisons). D) ROI analysis. Each data point shows the Fisher transformed Spearman correlation, averaged over the searchlight map within each ROI and over participants. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Brace and asterisk indicates significant   p   ​< ​.001 ​  F  -test comparing the strength of Spearman correlation between auditory and parietal regions. 
  Fig. 5   

Repeated measures ANOVA of the saliency judgments, with frequency and AM rate as factors, revealed a significant main effect of frequency (reflecting higher saliency for increasing frequency;   F  (2,10) ​= ​31.5,   p   ​< ​.001) and a significant main effect of AM rate (reflecting higher saliency for the middle AM rate;   F  (2,10) ​= ​6.34,   p   ​< ​.025). However, the interaction between frequency and AM rate was not significant (  F  (4,20) ​= ​0.808, p ​= ​.512). To directly test whether there was positive evidence for the null effect of no interaction, we also conducted repeated measures ANOVA as a Bayesian analysis ( ,  ;  ). We contrasted a model which contained both main effects of frequency and AM and their interaction, with a null model that had the same structure but lacked the interaction (both models were assigned a prior probability of 0.5). This analysis indicated that the null model was 5 times more likely than the alternative model (Bayes Factor ​= ​5.31). As the integrated coding effect in parietal cortex is defined by the interaction between frequency and AM, the absence of an interaction in the saliency judgments is therefore inconsistent with a saliency-based account of the integrated coding effect in parietal cortex, or indeed, in any other of the regions in which integrated coding was observed. 

As a further test of a saliency-based account, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to relate listeners’ saliency judgments to the observed multivoxel patterns ( ). For each pair of sounds presented in the saliency judgment task, we pooled saliency judgments over trials and participants and computed the absolute difference in the percentage of observations each sound in the pair was chosen as more salient. From this we assembled a distance matrix quantifying the difference in saliency between the two sounds of all presented pairs ( B). This “saliency distance” matrix provides a more detailed characterization of between-stimulus differences in saliency than the summary measure presented in  A, which we could then correlate with the multivoxel dissimilarity matrix observed in each searchlight across the cortex of individual participants. As shown in  C, the (Fisher-transformed) Spearman correlation between the saliency and multivoxel dissimilarity structure was significantly above zero in the superior temporal plane bilaterally but not in parietal cortex (for MNI coordinates, see  ). This pattern was further supported by an ROI analysis ( D) in which the Spearman correlation significantly decreased from superior temporal to parietal cortex (  F  (1,19) ​= ​57.8,   p   ​< ​.001; effects involving hemisphere were not significant). We further note with interest how this saliency-to-multivoxel correlation peaked in posteromedial auditory area Te1.1, which clearly differs to how the independent and integrated coding effects were expressed over cortical regions (compare  D with  B). Nearly identical results were obtained when using loudness in this ROI analysis (here a loudness distance matrix was formed by computing the absolute differences in loudness between the stimuli). This suggests that saliency/loudness can be reliably dissociated from the independent and integrated coding effects of the earlier analyses. In summary then, this RSA analysis together with the absence of interactive influences of frequency and AM on behavioral saliency judgments suggests that the integrated coding effect we observe cannot be attributed to saliency/loudness. We will return to this point in the Discussion. 



## Discussion 
  
In the current study, we manipulated two important acoustic features, frequency and AM rate, and determined the extent to which they are represented by independent versus integrated codes in fMRI multivoxel patterns. We demonstrate that these spectral and temporal dimensions are represented largely independently in the superior temporal plane, with only a weakly integrated component present in right Te1.0, Te1.2 and PT (amounting to no more than 4% of the frequency effect size and 50% of the AM rate effect size). In contrast, in a posterior parietal region not classically considered part of auditory cortex, multivoxel representation is exclusively integrated albeit weakly. 

### Independent representations in the superior temporal plane 
  
Our demonstration of largely independent representations of frequency and AM rate in the superior temporal plane might seem to contrast with evidence from animal physiology that suggest highly nonlinear representations already at the level of primary auditory cortex (e.g.  ;  ;  ). One explanation for why we see independent processing of frequency and AM is the spatial and temporal averaging inherent with fMRI ( ). This spatiotemporal averaging means that transient neural responses at a fine spatial scale will be underrepresented in BOLD signals and sustained responses at a large spatial scale will be overrepresented ( ;  ). Thus, while multivoxel patterns might show independent coding of frequency and AM, this does not exclude the possibility that other components of the neural representational code are nonlinear. 

Our findings may also reflect the specific features that were manipulated. Specifically, it has been suggested that frequency and AM rate are fundamental dimensions of sound analysis ( ;  ) and in the auditory cortex are represented as orthogonally-organized topographic maps (“tonotopy” and “periodotopy”; e.g.  ). The presence of dissociable topographic maps might indicate that frequency and AM are two independent features to which the cortex is tuned. While previous electrophysiological ( ) and fMRI ( ) findings from animals also support the notion of orthogonal topographic maps, in humans the evidence for an AM map is mixed with some studies showing clear topographic organization ( ;  ;  ) but others not ( ;  ;  ;  ). Indeed, our univariate analysis showed regional preferences for slow modulation rates throughout (consistent with  ) rather than a mixture of slow- and fast-tuned regions as would be expected for a topographic map (we acknowledge however that our analysis and imaging parameters were not optimized for characterizing modulation tuning using univariate methods; see below for further discussion). Previous conflicting findings may be attributed to the small size of auditory cortex and high inter-subject variability in anatomy. In the current study we circumvented these challenges by using a multivariate analysis method that abstracts away from the precise configuration of voxels. Importantly, this approach allowed us to directly test and quantify the degree of representational independence without the need to map features onto individual voxels. 

Despite being able to robustly detect independent coding of frequency and AM rate in superior temporal regions, we nonetheless found a strong bias for the frequency feature, with the effect size for AM rate amounting to no more than 8% of the frequency effect size. While this result might indicate that superior temporal cortex is more strongly tuned to frequency, it could also reflect that AM rates in our study varied over a restricted range (4–25 ​Hz) in order to limit spectral confounds ( ). 

Independent representation of frequency and AM features is also suggested by component analysis of human fMRI responses to natural sounds ( ). This work suggests that frequency and AM features are represented as independent components in partly overlapping regions of the superior temporal plane. However, this study did not test for feature interactions between those features, leaving unclear the relative contributions of independent and integrated representations to neural responses. Another study that did test for feature interactions used forward encoding models to predict superior temporal fMRI responses to natural sounds from frequency and spectrotemporal modulations ( ). This work suggests that a model based on conjunctions of these features better predicted fMRI responses than if the features in the model were represented separately. While this result might be taken to be inconsistent with the highly independent code demonstrated here, we note that in our ROI analysis we too observed significant integrated coding in the superior temporal plane. But a consideration of the standardized effect sizes, which the MANOVA approach readily provides ( ), suggests a more nuanced interpretation. That is, while an integrated component may be necessary to fully explain fMRI responses (hence the superiority of an encoding model based on conjunctions of features), the majority of variance can be explained by an independent representation. 

Thus, our study provides new evidence that frequency and AM are orthogonal dimensions of sound analysis. Such independent representation may support listeners’ ability to selectively process information in frequency versus time. In addition, as noted by  , an independent coding scheme will tend to convey more information than a highly-selective integrated code. This property would be desirable if the role of primary auditory cortex was to relay information to more specialized feature conjunction detectors in higher-level regions. 


### Integrated representation in posterior parietal cortex 
  
Our imaging of the entire cortex allowed us to probe beyond classically defined auditory cortex. In this respect, a striking demonstration here is of an exclusively integrated representation of frequency and AM rate in a left posterior parietal region, at the border between the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), inferior parietal lobule and occipital cortex. This finding is notable for two reasons. First, it parallels findings from the visual domain in which parietal cortex (in particular the IPS) shows increased fMRI responses in feature conjunction versus single feature tasks ( ;  ; see also   for a similar finding using multivariate methods), with damage to this region leading to feature binding deficits ( ). Second, BOLD activation in the IPS has been shown to systematically vary in auditory bi-stability ( ) and figure-ground paradigms ( ,  ). Indeed, the peak locations of the posterior parietal effects reported by these latter auditory studies fall inside the cluster reported here. In all these paradigms, perceptual outcomes are critically dependent on the way in which information across multiple features is combined and structured into object-based representations. Thus, the integrated representation for frequency and AM we observe here in parietal cortex is consistent with previous work suggesting a role for the IPS in feature integration and the structuring of sensory input. Further consistent with this, the location of our parietal cluster resides in the posterior portion of parietal cortex, where feature integration can be dissociated from effects of attention switching and task difficulty in anterior parietal regions ( ). However, our study goes beyond previous work in that neural responses evoked by stimulus features were contrasted directly, independently of listeners’ task (cf. feature search and bi-stability paradigms) and in the absence of salient stimulus features that would likely attract attention (cf. figure-ground paradigms). 

Because of previous findings from the visual domain implicating parietal cortex in bottom-up saliency ( ;  ), we also asked a separate group of listeners to rate the subjective saliency of the stimuli. While the sounds clearly differed in their subjective saliency, we found that influences of frequency and AM on the saliency ratings combined independently without evidence for an interaction, an observation inconsistent with a saliency-based account. It should be noted however that a limitation of this analysis is the small sample of participants (N ​= ​6) who provided the saliency judgments. In this respect, it is reassuring that when using RSA to relate saliency judgments to the dissimilarity structure of the multivoxel patterns, we found that the effect of saliency was confined to superior temporal plane regions with a peak in posteromedial auditory area Te1.1, which is reminiscent of findings by   who reported correlates of loudness in this region (see   for the close relationship between loudness and saliency). Thus, the results from this saliency analysis suggest that the observed integrated coding effect does not appear to relate to bottom-up saliency. 

Related to the issue of saliency, we also consider the possibility that the integrated coding profile we observe in parietal cortex was in part a consequence of listeners’ task. In our study, listeners performed an attentionally undemanding task that did not require explicit integration of frequency and AM features: detecting the target white-noise interruptions could in principle be based on changes in either the amplitude or spectral profiles alone. Despite this, one might argue that participants nevertheless detected the noise interruptions by attending to changes in both temporal and spectral content, in turn contributing to the integrated coding effect we observe. Indeed, as discussed below, attention has long been proposed to mediate feature integration ( ). However, we think that this is unlikely as an explanation for the current findings. The interaction between frequency and AM rate in parietal cortex resulted from differences in the multivoxel patterns evoked by our stimuli (while the task was fixed throughout). Thus, even if listeners monitored both spectral and temporal content to detect the target interruptions, it is unclear how this would have preferentially biased listeners’ attention towards certain feature conjunctions. This is because the targets were temporally unmodulated and spectrally wide-band and therefore “neutral” with respect to the nine feature conjunctions of the stimuli. 

A key assumption in our approach to distinguishing independent and integrated representations is a linear relationship between underlying neural activity and the measured fMRI signal ( ;  ). Our univariate analysis shows that the mean signal amplitude in the posterior parietal region did not differ from the implicit baseline (or interstimulus period). It also did not differ between stimuli, neither in terms of mains effects nor in the interaction between frequency and AM rate. This suggests that our experimental manipulations in this region did not evoke sufficiently large changes in mean signal to saturate the fMRI response and produce nonlinear signal changes that could be misinterpreted as an integrated representation. Nonetheless, it should be noted that our rapid event-related design means that any parietal responses would not have had time to fully return to baseline between sound events. Thus, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that parietal regions were constantly active and operating near saturation. However, further evidence against saturation-driven nonlinearities comes from a recent study formally demonstrating that between-stimulus (and between-action) differences in multivoxel patterns are robust to large changes in mean activity levels ( ). 

The integration of multiple feature representations is critical for building a cohesive perception of the auditory scene. However, even in parietal cortex, the effect size for integrated coding was small in comparison with that observed for independent coding in the superior temporal plane. Why then do we observe only weak integration of frequency and AM rate? As discussed above, frequency and AM may be privileged dimensions of sound analysis that are separable in a way that other dimensions are not. Our results may also be attributed to listeners performing an attentionally undemanding task that did not require explicit integration of frequency and AM features. It has been suggested that while individual features are detected automatically, feature integration is a computationally demanding process requiring focused attention ( ;  ). Thus, the absence of focused attention to feature conjunctions could explain the weak integration we observe. Future work, using manipulations of attention, will be required to test this proposal. 


### Spatial resolution of current fMRI data and relationship with previous mapping studies 
  
Because we wished to measure whole-brain responses, including in regions outside classically defined auditory cortex, we measured BOLD responses with a resolution of 3 ​mm isotropic voxels (the data were additionally smoothed with a 6 ​mm kernel but only after the critical multivariate statistics were computed). While finer-resolution data are commonly obtained in studies investigating how frequency and other acoustic features are mapped to individual voxels (e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ), our focus here is how frequency and AM features are represented in activity patterns over multiple voxels. It is well-established that multivoxel methods can sensitively measure changes in brain responses to acoustic features (even with 3 ​mm resolution data) by pooling weak but consistent signals over voxels and exploiting between-voxel correlations (e.g.  ). 

Note also that while significant independent coding of frequency and AM might be consistent with separate underlying neural populations responding to those features, this need not be the case. That is, the same neurons could simply be responding in a linear (additive) fashion to changes in frequency and AM rate. Moreover, the extent of representational independence versus integration does not bear on the issue of whether the underlying neural populations are “distributed” or “sparse” in nature ( ;  ). Thus, the extent of representational independence and integration in multivoxel patterns is a more abstract characterization of cortical processing than the precise spatial configuration of feature-tuned voxels. 


### Generality of findings 
  
One question that arises from the current work is the extent to which our findings generalize to other acoustic features. Our factorial design, combined with synthetic stimuli, allowed us to orthogonalize changes in frequency and AM features in a controlled fashion. This is a statistically powerful method for dissociating contributions of experimental manipulations (here of acoustic features) to observed neural responses ( ). At the same time however, this necessarily constrained the number of features we could investigate. Therefore, our findings should not be taken to mean that all acoustic features are encoded in the same way as the frequency and AM features studied here. 

Our factorial design contrasts with studies that have investigated the neural representation of acoustic features using natural sounds and statistical methods that enable many stimulus features to be studied simultaneously ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, the benefits of this more naturalistic approach come with substantial methodological challenges since acoustic features in natural sounds show substantial correlations, making it difficult to dissociate their neural contributions ( ;  ). Thus, we suggest that the approach taken here is complementary to studies using natural sounds. An extension for future work could increase the number of features manipulated factorially, combined with stimulus synthesis techniques to create more naturalistic (yet still controlled) sounds ( ;  ).

# Abstract
 
Resting-state Arterial Spin Labeling (rs-ASL) is a rather confidential method compared to resting-state BOLD. As ASL allows to quantify the cerebral blood flow, unlike BOLD, rs-ASL can lead to significant clinical subject-scaled applications. Despite directly impacting clinical practicability and functional networks estimation, there is no standard for rs-ASL regarding the acquisition duration. Our work here focuses on assessing the feasibility of ASL as an rs-fMRI method and on studying the effect of the acquisition duration on the estimation of functional networks. To this end, we acquired a long 24 min 30 s rs-ASL sequence and investigated how estimations of six typical functional brain networks evolved with respect to the acquisition duration. Our results show that, after a certain acquisition duration, the estimations of all functional networks reach their best and are stabilized. Since, for clinical application, the acquisition duration should be the shortest possible, we suggest an acquisition duration of 14 min, i.e., 240 volumes with our sequence parameters, as it covers the functional networks estimation stabilization.

## 1. Introduction 
  
Functional MR imaging (fMRI) builds the links between location and function in the brain. The two main sub-domains in fMRI are task-based fMRI and resting-state fMRI. In task-based fMRI, the location of a function is considered to be where the acquired signal matches with the task guidelines given to the subject (Poldrack et al.,  ). In resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), as no task is given, the focus is on fluctuations in voxels time-series induced by spontaneous neural activations. Similarities in these time-series in different areas have been shown to not be random but to be matching the function of the brain (Biswal et al.,  ). These similarities between neural activation pattern define the   functional connectivity   of the brain, and show the underlying cerebral architecture is organized into functional specialized units, called networks, communicating with each other (Varoquaux and Craddock,  ; Fan et al.,  ). Resting-state functional imaging aims to identify functional networks of the brain and to depict how they interact outside any structural connectivity consideration (Van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol,  ). As the resting-state is rather easy to achieve, especially for the pediatric and elderly population but also for cognitive impaired patients, rs-fMRI has found some niche clinical applications in diseases investigation. The key concept is to consider the brain as a unique integrative network of the estimated functional networks, assimilated with the mathematical structure of a graph (Van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol,  ; Wang et al.,  ). The graph properties model the functional architecture: each node corresponds to a functional network, and edges configuration depicts how they interdepend. For instance, functional connectivity is altered in disease like schizophrenia (Lynall et al.,  ; Kindler et al.,  ), major depression (Mulders et al.,  ), Alzheimer's disease (Sanz-Arigita et al.,  ; Agosta et al.,  ). Rs-fMRI, as a global investigation of function, is also appropriate for neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis (Faivre et al.,  ; Filippi et al.,  ; Cruz-Gómez et al.,  ), Parkinson's disease (Gao and Wu,  ), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Mohammadi et al.,  ; Trojsi et al.,  ). 

Another subdivision in fMRI concerns the way the signal is obtained. The two major techniques are Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI and functional Arterial Spin Labeling (fASL). Based on neurovascular coupling effects, BOLD techniques rely on the local signal variation induced by the neuron consumption of blood oxygen (Kim and Ugurbil,  ). Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) is an MRI perfusion technique that uses magnetically labeled arterial water protons as an endogenous tracer (Detre et al.,  ). An inversion pulse labels the inflowing blood, and, after a delay called the post-labeling delay, a labeled image of the volume of interest is acquired. The subtraction of the labeled image from a control image, i.e., non-labeled, reflects the quantity of spins that have perfused the imaged volume, producing what is commonly called a perfusion-weighted (PW) image. The PW map can be used to quantify the cerebral blood flow (CBF) under some assumptions (Buxton et al.,  ; Borogovac and Asllani,  ). The absence of a contrast agent injection makes ASL well-suited for CBF longitudinal studies, particularly for a pediatric population or for a population with poor venous access or contrast agent contraindication. The quantification of CBF is the main advantage of ASL over BOLD. Indeed, a BOLD signal provides an indirect and non-quantitative measurement of neural activity, as it results from a combination of variations in CBF, cerebral blood volume, and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (Buxton,  ). The main drawback of ASL is its lower signal-to-noise ratio compared to BOLD fMRI. The repetition time (TR) is also twice to three times higher in rs-ASL compared to resting-state BOLD (rs-BOLD), which impacts its temporal resolution. Furthermore, ASL can be implemented through numerous MRI sequences, and meta-analyses can be difficult to set up, as ASL shows a high sequence parameter dependency (Buxton et al.,  ; Grade et al.,  ; Mutsaerts et al.,  ). Nevertheless, a consensus seems to be emerging over the years (Alsop et al.,  ). BOLD is, however, predominant in clinical usage and in academic research and is therefore considered the gold standard in rs-fMRI. Consequently, rs-ASL has been mostly used for research purposes. However, the recent increasing involvement of all MRI stakeholders is highly beneficial in order to further develop rs-ASL usage in terms of a guide for clinical practitioners (Grade et al.,  ) as well as consensus on implementation (Alsop et al.,  ), feasibility, and viability (Chen et al.,  ). Despite its lower SNR, but thanks to its closer proximity to neural activation (Duong et al.,  ; Tjandra et al.,  ) and CBF quantification, rs-ASL has been proven to be a serious contender to resting-state BOLD in schizophrenia (Zhu et al.,  ) and Alzheimer's disease (Alsop et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). Resting-state ASL has also found its own clinical applications with investigation of chronic fatigue syndrome (Boissoneault et al.,  ) and catatonia (Walther et al.,  ). 

The acquisition duration is an important parameter in an rs-fMRI study with strong practical consequences. Most current rs-ASL studies work with a duration from 8 to 13 min and a TR from 3 to 4 s, i.e., 120–260 images. Intuitively, one would assume the longer the duration the better the sampling of the signal correlation across the brain and, thus, the better the acquisition. However, this requires us to define what “better” actually means and does not consider the practical questions of clinical implementation and subject resting-state upholding. To the best of our knowledge, some papers already studied the influence of duration in rs-BOLD (Van Dijk et al.,  ; Anderson et al.,  ; Birn et al.,  ; Laumann et al.,  ; Termenon et al.,  ; Bouix et al.,  ), whereas, in rs-ASL, it has not been explored yet. In this work, we first focus on the feasibility of detecting functional networks with rs-ASL. We remain as close as what a typical investigator of rs-ASL would experience by implementing usual sequence, processing, and functional networks detection methods. We then assess a trend over the duration influence on rs-ASL detected networks quality: we do not directly assess whether an acquisition is good at a given time but rather how it evolves with longer durations. After describing the scores used and the modeling approach, an in-depth analysis for the Default-Mode Network (DMN) will be presented in order to illustrate scores evolution on the most typical resting-state network. Finally, we will show results for all the functional networks under consideration and discuss a recommended sequence duration in rs-ASL. 


## 2. Materials 
  
### 2.1. Subjects 
  
Seven healthy male right-handed subjects aged from 21 to 28 years (23.5 yo ± 2.5) were involved in this study. All subjects gave written informed consent before participating in the study. We have maintained the homogeneity of the population in order to limit the influence of factors, such as gender or age. 


### 2.2. MR Acquisitions 
  
The subjects were scanned on a 3.0T whole body Siemens MR scanner (Magnetom Verio, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil. A 3D anatomical T1-weighted MP2RAGE image was acquired for each subject. The resting-state ASL imaging was performed using a 2D EPI pseudo-continuous (pCASL) sequence. Subjects were asked to keep their eyes closed, to relax (mind-wandering), to lie still and to not fall asleep. We used common parameters reported in the literature: TR = 3,500 ms, FoV = 224 × 224 mm , TE = 12 ms, LD = 1,500 ms and a 1250 ms post-labeling delay (PLD) at the first slice (1712.5 ms at the median slice). Volumes were made of 24 slices of 64 × 64 voxels with 5 mm slice thickness with 20% gap for a total resolution of 3.5 × 3.5 × 6 mm . The number of volumes was 420 for a total duration of 24 min 30 s. 


### 2.3. Data Pre-processing 
  
For each subject, the raw pCASL series is divided into 46 sub-series. The duration of these sub-series ranges from nearly 2 min (34 volumes) to 24 min 30 s (420 volumes) with a time step of 30 s. For the sake of simplicity, we will only mention rounded durations hereafter. All these subdivisions are made   before   any preprocessing: the preprocessing is done independently on each sub-series. For the preprocessing steps and their parameters, we chose the most common ones found in bibliography. While identifying the best preprocessing is still an open topic in rs-ASL in particular and in rs-fMRI in general (Gargouri et al.,  ), a general routine can be discerned in the literature. For the preprocessing steps, we used Matlab CONN toolbox ( ,  ) (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon,  ). Preprocessing starts with the realignment of the functional data. All the functional volumes are rigidly registered to the first one using SPM12 realign procedure (Andersson et al.,  ). Second step is the indirect normalization of the functional volumes (Nieto-Castanon,  ). It starts with the affine registration of the functional data, with the mean volume of the realigned series as the source image, on the anatomical 3D T1 using SPM12 inter-modality co-registration procedure with a normalized mutual information cost function. Then the anatomical image is registered on the MNI 152 template using SPM12 unified segmentation and normalization procedure (Ashburner and Friston,  ). In parallel, perfusion-weighted maps are computed using a surround subtraction on the realigned functional data. Both transformations (functional to structural, structural to MNI) are composed to register subtracted functional data on the MNI template. We then used Gaussian smoothing with a typical 6 mm FWHM radius (Alakörkkö et al.,  ) and pass-band filtering with a range from 0.005 to 0.1 Hz. Final denoising was made with aCOMPCOR, using five regressors for white-matter, five for cerebro-spinal fluid, and the 12 from the realignment step (Behzadi et al.,  ). All these steps are shown in  .

The functional data is registered on the anatomical 3D T1 (a). Then the anatomical image is registered on the MNI 152 template (b). After a surround subtraction (c), transformations of (a) and (b) are composed to register functional data on the MNI template (d). We then used Gaussian smoothing with a typical 6 mm FWHM radius and pass-band filtering with a range from 0.005 to 0.1 Hz. Final denoising is made with COMPCOR. 
  


## 3. Methods 
  
### 3.1. Detecting Networks With Seed-Based Analysis 
  
To obtain the mapping of individual functional networks, we relied on seed-based analysis (SBA) (Van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol,  ). The principle of this method, the first proposed to define functional connectivity (Biswal et al.,  ), is quite straightforward. Considering a similarity measure [usually linear correlation, but many others exist (Zhou et al.,  )], SBA builds functional areas by gathering voxels which exhibit a matching signal, in the sense of the chosen measure, to that of a ROI, called the seed in this context. Even if SBA is a very polymorphic modeling method, we used its most common form in our work. We therefore considered linear correlation as the similarity measure and used a set of 20 single voxels as seeds. Seeds are spread in the expected location of six usual functional networks: DMN, Sensori-motor, Language, Salience, Visual, and Cerebellum. The exact positions of the seeds in the MNI152 space are provided in the   section and were suggested by the CONN toolbox. Each seed provides a linear correlation map of the brain. To estimate a functional network for each seed, we statistically tested whether the signal between the seed and a candidate voxel is positively correlated with a risk of 1% FWER-corrected with Bonferroni procedure. This is a tough conservative testing compared to most of rs-ASL (even fMRI in general) studies, but we agree with the recommendation of Eklund et al. ( ) on false positives underestimation in fMRI literature. 


### 3.2. Evaluation Scores 
  
The resting-state BOLD literature suggests different acquisition durations: 6 min (Van Dijk et al.,  ), 10 min (Bouix et al.,  ), 12 min (Birn et al.,  ), 25 min (Anderson et al.,  ), and even 100 min (Laumann et al.,  ). In Termenon et al. ( ), Termenon et al. focus on the tradeoff that can be made between duration and number of subjects in a group study. They recommend durations ranging from 7 min for 100 subjects to 14 min for 40 subjects. The main reason of their apparent discrepancy is the modeling. Indeed, there are many ways to properly define a model to assess the role of acquisition duration (  a fortiori   how much duration is enough), even if they lead to different conclusions. As a pioneer work on rs-ASL, we wanted our modeling to reflect an investigator's experience with the impact of acquisition duration on functional network estimation.   illustrates the investigation of acquisition duration we will model. The DMN estimation is validated after 14 min on   because it matches with how the functional network is expected to look like. In modeling terms, it is basically assessing the overlap of the estimated network with a reference network. In order to investigate a trend afterwards and decide which acquisition duration is enough, the individual functional maps were compared to a reference, as in process described in  . For that purpose, we relied on the Multi-Subjects Dictionary Learning atlas (MSDL) by Varoquaux et al. ( ). The MSDL is an atlas of 17 resting-state functional networks containing our six networks of interest and from which our seeds and subjects are independent. The key idea is to have functional maps close to what an expert would expect to observe when looking for the typical functional areas investigated here. To study the quality of the detected networks as a function of the acquisition duration, we evaluated the overlap between the SBA estimated functional maps and the MSDL references (simply called “reference” hereafter) through two measures: the Jaccard's index and the area under curve (AUC). 
  
Seed-based estimation of subject 3 DMN with posterior seed at different acquisition durations. Four stages can be identified. At 2 min (1), the map mostly shows false positive noise detection. Between 4 and 8 min (2), the false positive noise has disappeared while the posterior component of the DMN starts growing. Between 10 and 12 min (3), the posterior component is well-detected, and the frontal and the lateral components have appeared, but quite poorly. At 14 min and after (4), DMN detection is good and interestingly, stable. 
  
Let   be a set, let   be observations in   and   binary categorical variables. In fMRI,   is the voxels space, the   v   are the voxels, and the variables   M  ,   M   are the functional networks to be compared, which associate to each voxel   v  : 1 if the voxel belong to the functional network, 0 otherwise. The definition of   M   and   M   is binary here, but it can easily be extended to probability maps. In our case,   M   corresponds to the estimation of a functional network, and   M   corresponds to the functional network reference from the MSDL. Let   A  ,  B  ,  C  ,  D   be four sets with the respective cardinals   a  ,  b  ,  c  ,  d   defined by 

Almost all common similarity measures (Sokal measure family, Sørensen-Dice, correlation etc.) can be defined with   a  ,  b  ,  c  ,  d  , e.g., Sørensen-Dice score: 2  a  /(2  a   +   b   +   c  ). As   M   (MSDL reference) can be considered as a ground-truth, therefore   a   becomes the number of   True Positives  ,   b   of   False Positives  ,   c   of   False Negatives   and   d   of   True Negatives  . We also have the   Sensitivity  :   a  /(  a   +   c  ),   Specificity  :   d  /(  d   +   b  ), and the   Positive Predicted Value   (PPV):   a  /(  a   +   b  ). 

#### 3.2.1. Jaccard's Index 
  
When comparing two spatially distributed data like functional networks, a straightforward measure is the Jaccard's index. It is the ratio between the size of the functional networks' intersection and their union. It is defined by   J   =   a  /(  a   +   b   +   c  ) in our notation system. It provides intuitive and visual information about the overlap between one SBA estimation of functional network and one reference network from the MSDL. It is also test-dependent: changing the risk or the multiple comparisons correction at the estimation step will also change the shape and extent of the functional network, generally modifying Jaccard's index. This may be considered as a drawback, but, in fact, a statistical test is usually used at some point when investigating fMRI data. 


#### 3.2.2. Receiver Operating Characteristic Analysis 
  
In this section, we assume that the binary categorical variables are parameterized by at least one parameter. For example, in our case, it could be the   p  -value for the statistical test of correlation α that was used to estimate functional networks from the correlation map. Let   r   be our parameter,   a  ,   b  ,   c  , and   d   the previously defined cardinals in (1) now parameterized by   r  , and let define a set {(  x  (  r  ),   y  (  r  )),   r   ∈ [−1, 1]} ⊂ [0, 1]  by 

The implicitly defined function   f   :   x   ↦   y   is called the   Receiver operating characteristic curve   (ROC-curve), and its integral   is simply called the   Area Under Curve   (AUC). In the case where   M   is considered to be the truth,   f   is just informally   f   : 1 −   Specificity   ↦   Sensitivity  . The AUC has the interesting property to not be test-dependent, as it covers all possible values of the threshold parameter (e.g., risk/correlation). It illustrates how a functional map can be close to the reference by considering all values of the considered parameter, while the Jaccard's index reflects how it is close to the reference by considering one value of the given parameter. Hence AUC seems a better way to assess the trend of interest from a theoretical point of view. However, it is further away from the practical proximity and easier interpretation of the Jaccard's index modeling offers. 



### 3.3. Modeling Scores Evolution With Respect to the Duration 
  
With each of the 20 seeds are 322 associated functional network estimations that correspond to seven estimations per each of the 46 different acquisition durations (seven subjects, 46 sub-series). For each seed, and for one of the six functional network references from the MSDL, both Jaccard's index and AUC are computed between the reference and the 322 estimations associated with the seed. The last step is to model the scores evolution according to the acquisition duration for all subjects and for each combination between one seed and one reference. Let us first check assumptions to select a suitable regression model. Assuming the rs-ASL sequence lasts long enough to cover all usage with 24 min 30 s, extrapolation for a duration longer than 24 min 30 s seems superfluous. We are not interested in an explicit formula between scores and acquisition duration, as there is no theoretical model, even in BOLD, on the dependence between acquisition duration and functional network estimation. Moreover, even processed independently, within-subject functional networks estimations have a strong dependency since they come from the same acquisition. Under these three conditions, a local non-parametric regression is very well-suited. We chose to use the LOESS regression model (Cleveland and Devlin,  ). While the model name is a reference to a geological structure, LOESS is commonly understood as “locally estimated scatterplot smoothing”. LOESS is a local polynomial regression computed on subsets of the whole dataset with each subset being defined for each time-points by a weighted K-nearest neighbors algorithm. We used second degree polynomial functions with a 0.8 span. For a more comprehensive description of LOESS, see Cleveland and Devlin ( ). A LOESS regression curve is computed for each score on each set of 322 overlap scores corresponding to one combination of seed and MSDL references. 



## 4. Results 
  
### 4.1. Effect of the Acquisition Duration for the Default Mode Network 
  
In this section, we present an in-depth analysis of the DMN. In the set of 20 seeds we used, many should not be inspected when used in combination with MSDL DMN. The main reason is that most of the combinations have no objective basis for detecting the DMN. Otherwise, the seed may have failed to detect precisely the networks it was meant to detect, which is expected with very short acquisition duration. A good way to get an idea of the quality of the overlap between the functional maps associated with a seed and a reference for all durations is to check the boxplots of the Jaccard's index as in  . Boxplots give an overview of the results for rs-ASL: for the DMN reference, Jaccard's indices have higher values for the seeds placed in order to detect it. Prefrontal and posterior seeds seem to work well, while lateral DMN seeds provide lower scores but still higher than any other seeds.   shows the evolution of the estimated DMN with the posterior seed and corresponding scores for one subject. The depiction made by the scores of the overlap between the estimation of the DMN and the MSDL reference matches with the four stages identified in  .   shows the Jaccard's index, AUC, Sensitivity and Predicted Positive Value (PPV) for each subject and at each acquisition duration. We chose to report the positive predicted value rather than specificity for two main reasons. On the one hand, true negatives can have multiple definitions in fMRI since it depends on the voxels considered: the whole volume, only the brain, or any smaller ROI, such as gray matter. Although it is logical to consider only brain voxels for functional activity, this implies an extremely high number of true negatives since the volume of a functional network is 10–100 times smaller than the one of the whole brain. Therefore, the specificity reaches values too high to provide relevant information on similarity between functional areas. On the other hand, like specificity, PPV plays a similar role with respect to sensitivity: specificity gives a complementary information to sensitivity in the totality of voxels whereas PPV gives a complementary information in the union of the reference and the estimated functional area. LOESS on Jaccard's index, as well as on AUC, models quite well what can be observed by looking directly at the functional map as in  . Jaccard's index seems to stabilize after 12–13 min and AUC at an earlier acquisition duration around 9–10 min. We could have expected sensitivity and PPV to follow the same trend. Actually, sensitivity just grows over time but more slowly for longer durations. Interestingly, PPV reaches a peak in the second stage mentioned above. The seven subjects show different levels of response but good correlations (except for the subject 2 with AUC), i.e., the trend is the same among subject, rather than an average effect induced by the LOESS. Moreover, results observed for the DMN can be generalized for almost every combination of seeds and references as we will see. 
  
Each boxplot corresponds to one seed and shows the distribution of Jaccard's index between the estimated functional area corresponding to the considered seed on the one hand, and the MSDL DMN reference on the other hand, for all subjects and all durations. The seeds are grouped by color, each corresponding to one of the six functional areas considered. As expected, the seeds located in the expected DMN location (in pink) give the best results.

On all subjects, Jaccard's index increases with duration before 10–12 min, then stabilizes. The AUC shows the same trend with an earlier stabilization, around 9–10 min. PPV grows rapidly, reaches a peak at 8 min, then decreases slowly. Finally, Sensitivity increases with time, but more slowly for longer durations. Subjects show different level of response but good correlations. 
  

### 4.2. Effect of the Acquisition Duration for All Functional Networks 
  
As seen for the DMN, many combinations between seeds and references should not be investigated since they are not functionally meaningful and will yield to very low overlapping scores (e.g., prefrontal seed with visual cortex). With more than 6,000 functional maps generated (20 seeds, seven subjects, 46 different acquisition durations), a visual checking of all the maps is not practicable in order to discard seeds that failed to detect corresponding functional networks. In order to investigate only combinations between seeds and references that provide successful detections, we use empirical criteria on the scores distribution. For Jaccard's index, we select the combinations for which at least 50% of observations have   J   ⩾ 0.1. The reasoning behind the choice of the criterion was as follows. With   and additional visual inspections on different subjects, we observe that the seed in prefrontal cortex is successful in the detection of the DMN after a certain acquisition duration. Hence, the corresponding boxplot to the prefrontal seeds in   provides a Jaccard's index distribution of a successful seed. We assume then that the combinations between seeds and references that have a similar distribution or a better one (i.e., higher values) also correspond to seeds that are able to provide successful estimation of functional networks. We choose to characterize these seeds considered as successful in the estimation, and   a fortiori  , corresponding boxplots, when the median is above 0.1. Using the same considerations on AUC, we also considered the median with a threshold of 0.7. These thresholds on the median values may seem rather low, but let us remember that all the acquisition durations are taken into account, even the shortest ones.   shows the median values of the scores for each set of 322 functional networks estimations corresponding to combinations between seeds and references. The two thresholds lead to an almost identical choice for the selection of combinations. All seeds have their best scores with the expected reference, and each of the six functional networks are considered to be sufficiently well-detected with SBA for Jaccard's index in accordance with our selection rules. The AUC suggests as good enough one more seed for cerebellum but considers that salience is not detected well-enough with our set of seeds. 
  
Color maps of median values of Jaccard's indices and AUC for all combinations of seeds and MSDL references. Green circles show where seeds are considered to provide successful detection with respect to our thresholding rules (0.1 for the Jaccard median and 0.7 for the AUC median). The first column of Jaccard's index median values corresponds to the boxplots shown in  , which showed distribution of Jaccard's index for every seeds in combination with the MSDL DMN reference. The color code used for the seed here is the same as in the boxplots. 
  
 shows the range of durations where scores are not significantly different from their maximum values (5% risk) for each selected reference/seed combination. Each line corresponds to a LOESS curve computed for one score (Jaccard's index/AUC) and one combination between seed and reference network (322 functional networks estimation per combination). The colors on the heatmap are scaled between minimum and maximum values of the corresponding score and matches with the stages already described for DMN in the previous section. Indeed, for every combination between seeds and references, both scores rapidly increase, and start to stabilize after a certain duration. However, for both measures, the 95% confidence interval around the maximum suggests a later start in the stabilization than suggested directly by the LOESS curve values. While some combinations scores look already stabilized at 12 min, almost all of them are close to their maximum value at 16 min.   shows a collection of functional areas obtained at a duration of 14 min. While the language seed struggles to detect spatial components far from the seeds, all the other ones provide good detection of expected functional networks. The two bottom rows show the same subjects and the same reference with different seeds.

Each line corresponds to the computation of one LOESS curve on a subset of 322 functional networks estimations, these subsets of estimations corresponding to a selected seed. Every combination has a rapidly increasing score followed by a stabilization stage. The PPV peak shows on all combinations around 9 min and appears always just before score start stabilizing. Maximum and its 95% confidence interval may be unstable since score variations are often low after PPV peak.

Similarly, the bottom row shows the same subject (subject 1) with different seeds (“Prefrontal” and “Posterior”). 
  


## 5. Discussion 
  
Our two objectives were to confirm the feasibility of resting state ASL and to evaluate the influence of the acquisition duration on the estimation of functional areas.  ,   with corresponding scores in   and in   confirm that, even with a classic sequence, and the basic preprocessing and modeling we used, ASL is fully viable as a resting-state method. Regarding the impact of acquisition duration, the most important result is the stabilization of the functional areas estimation after a certain duration for both measures, Jaccard's index and AUC, with a strong inter-subjects correlation (i.e., not a mean-effect induced by the LOESS modeling). Since the acquisition should have the shortest duration possible for clinical implementation, the recommended duration eventually corresponds to the start of the stabilization stage. Stricter definitions of the stabilization stage would lead to longer duration since they would heavily rely on the LOESS curve maximum by considering as stable just a narrow interval around the maximum. However, since after 12–14 min the score variations are low, a slight change in preprocessing or in the population could also lead to an unstable maximum without changing the trend. Relaxed definitions would keep recommended duration stability, but they may consider a functional area as good enough when a human investigator would not. Actually, early stages of acquisition are associated with poor representation of functional areas not in the same connected component that the seed, as we saw with  ,  . Based on our different results, 14 min seems to be an interesting compromise between shortest duration and best estimation of functional networks. 

Regarding the rs-BOLD, others studies have suggested different values for duration/number of volumes: 6 min/72 vol. (Van Dijk et al.,  ), 10 min/250 vol. (Bouix et al.,  ), 12 min/275 vol. (Birn et al.,  ), 25 min/750 vol. (Anderson et al.,  ), and 100 min/2,700 vol. (Laumann et al.,  ). In Termenon et al. ( ), Termenon et al. give as reliable configuration from 14 min/1,200 vol. for 40 subjects to 7 min/580 vol. for 100 subjects. Each paper assesses the effect of acquisition duration in rsBOLD differently: comparison to networks obtained from the longest acquisition (Bouix et al.,  ), connectivity between regions of interest (Birn et al.,  ), reproducibility (Anderson et al.,  ; Laumann et al.,  ), and scoring on graph properties (Termenon et al.,  ). Hence, because of the different modeling, it is hard to say where our rs-ASL suggestion would be placed compared to the different rs-BOLD results, notwithstanding the different sequence and preprocessing. The different quality assessments are not a drawback however, as each work explores different aspects of the impact of the acquisition duration/number of volumes. A natural area of future investigations would be to compare rs-ASL performance to rs-BOLD with the inclusion of acquisition duration/number of volumes as a parameter. Furthermore, as we wanted to also confirm the efficiency of ASL in resting-state fMRI, we naturally focused on a subject scale study and functional networks estimation, but, as rs-BOLD literature shows, numerous aspects of the effect of acquisition duration are yet to be explored. 

In order to estimate functional networks, the two most common methods are SBA and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). As ICA is also widely used in rs-fMRI, an investigation of the functional network's spatial stabilization in rs-ASL using the definition of functional connectivity through statistical independence should be beneficial. Indeed, it is not totally guaranteed that statistical independence and linear correlation (or any other alternative modeling of functional connectivity) provide a similar stabilization phenomenon, even if SBA and ICA eventually provide similar functional networks (Cole et al.,  ; Joel et al.,  ). 

Note that the DMN, the sensori-motor cortex, and the cerebellum have an almost consensual spatial definition among the authors, unlike language, visual and salience, which show a greater spatial variability (see for example  ). As we provide an evaluation only with one set of references (from the MSDL), this could be a limitation of our work and could call into question the score values we obtained. However, the spatial variability of the areas of interest in atlases is low enough to change only the scores but not the trend observed in this paper. Indeed, overlap scores can be interpreted as distances, and, in that sense, we measured the distance between functional networks estimation and fixed points (the set of references). Changing the set of references modifies scores values but not the stabilization phenomenon, as the references are still fixed. Score values were used for seeds validation by thresholding overlap scores with MSDL references. After considering only the successful seeds, the score values matter less than their stabilization after a certain acquisition duration. Regarding the score values, using a ground truth built from subjects would most likely bias the scores toward higher values but could also question the validity of such ground truth, where confidence in atlases is much stronger. Niazy et al. ( ), Zhu et al. ( ) report that a Sørensen-Dice score of 0.3 corresponds to a good overlap, regarding the reproducibility of functional networks between rs-ASL and rs-BOLD (i.e., with ground-truth built from same set of subjects). As a Sørensen-Dice score of 0.3 corresponds to a Jaccard's index of 0.176 , and our subjects are independent from the MSDL BOLD atlas, the median values of Jaccard's indices we obtained in  ,  , or the values we obtained in  ,  , confirm   a posteriori   the criteria for seeds selection, and   a fortiori  , rs-ASL's ability to provide good estimation of functional networks. 

Preprocessing influence should also be considered as positive: since we use typical and basic preprocessing, more advanced techniques should foster functional networks estimation, and therefore, provide the same or an earlier stabilization, still keeping our suggestion as a sufficient duration. The same is true for ASL readout approach. Using a 3D readout is probably an improvement in our sequence, as it tends to have higher SNR compared to 2D EPI, but not every investigator has access to 3D sequences (Alsop et al.,  ). Not to mention readout approach, ASL is very sensitive to changes in its parameters. Since we are studying the influence of acquisition duration for a given set of parameters, the suggested sufficient duration of 14 min for rs-ASL could be strongly influenced by the sequence parameters. Although the influence of each of them is to be kept in mind, most of them should not disturb the investigators, as most of them have a specific bibliography that goes well-beyond the issue of the acquisition duration. However, two sequence parameters may have a deep impact on our results: post-labeling delay (PLD) and repetition time (TR). For the PLD, the 1,250 ms duration we used for the first slice corresponds to 1712.5 ms at the median slice. Shorter PLD, like 600 ms, seems to give a better functional estimation (Viviani et al.,  ; Liang et al.,  ,  ). We kept the PLD quite long, close to the 1,800 ms at the median slice, which is recommended for best estimation of CBF (Alsop et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). Indeed, the main advantage of ASL is ultimately to compute CBF, although we focused on functional areas estimation in this paper. The critical parameter in our opinion is repetition time. It defines the sample frequency of the resting-state signal and turns our 14 min suggestion into 240 volumes since we only work numerically on the signal. Its variation may shift the stabilization step toward a higher/lower number of volumes and hence a longest/shortest duration, without changing the stabilization of the functional networks estimation after a certain number of volumes (i.e., same signal but different sampling frequency). Moreover in rs-ASL, TR values are typically between 3 and 5 s, which is too wide to assume the locally linear dependence between TR and optimal duration. As a pioneer work on the effect of acquisition duration in rs-ASL, we focused more on the modeling rather than investigating the influence of the TR. In rsBOLD, the TR has already been shown to be able to impact estimation considering a fixed number of volumes (Wu et al.,  ), but for rs-ASL a specific investigation of TR in combination with the number of volumes would be highly valuable. 


## 6. Conclusion 
  
Usual sequence, preprocessing, and SBA managed to reconstruct the six typical functional networks of interest at the subject scale, which confirms the feasibility of ASL as a rsfMRI technique. The main objective was to find the amount of data to acquire in rs-ASL to properly estimate functional networks, considering that clinical implementation requires the shortest possible duration. Our results show that functional networks estimations stabilize after a certain number of volumes/duration. For our set of sequence parameters, we suggest 240 volumes/14 min to achieve an overall stabilization. Any method that improves the detection of functional networks is likely to provide an earlier stabilization start, i.e., a lower number for volume/duration. Hence, since we use a basic and typical sequence, preprocessing and estimation, 240 volumes/14 min should be enough for most rs-ASL usage. Last, the exploration of the impact of the TR and PLD in combination with acquisition duration was beyond the scope of this article but would be highly beneficial for sequence implementation since we forecast them to be the two parameters that may shift the stabilization start toward higher number of volumes.

# Abstract
 
Computer interaction   via   visually guided hand movements often employs either abstract cursor-based feedback or virtual hand (VH) representations of varying degrees of realism. The effect of changing this visual feedback in virtual reality settings is currently unknown. In this study, 19 healthy right-handed adults performed index finger movements (“action”) and observed movements (“observation”) with four different types of visual feedback: a simple circular cursor (CU), a point light (PL) pattern indicating finger joint positions, a shadow cartoon hand (SH) and a realistic VH. Finger movements were recorded using a data glove, and eye-tracking was recorded optically. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both action and observation conditions showed stronger fMRI signal responses in the occipitotemporal cortex compared to baseline. The action conditions additionally elicited elevated bilateral activations in motor, somatosensory, parietal, and cerebellar regions. For both conditions, feedback of a hand with a moving finger (SH, VH) led to higher activations than CU or PL feedback, specifically in early visual regions and the occipitotemporal cortex. Our results show the stronger recruitment of a network of cortical regions during visually guided finger movements with human hand feedback when compared to a visually incomplete hand and abstract feedback. This information could have implications for the design of visually guided tasks involving human body parts in both research and application or training-related paradigms.

## Introduction 
  
Visually guided arm and hand movements are common in many computer-mediated interactions for motor research, training, and entertainment (Mattar and Gribble,  ; Archambault et al.,  ). Such interactions typically use cursors (Oreja-Guevara et al.,  ; Veilleux and Proteau,  ), often in the form of simple circles, to provide feedback on the current position of the endpoint of the hand and arm. Feedback in the form of a cursor carries enough information for the central nervous system to plan and execute the required movements if the task accomplishment only depends on the position of the cursor. However, visual cues that are more realistic could conceivably improve performance in these movement scenarios. Previous studies showed that seeing a hand for a short period at movement initiation, either real (Veilleux and Proteau,  ) or virtual (Sober and Sabes,  ), led to higher accuracy during goal-directed target reaching. Based on these results, we previously experimented on adults comparing different forms of online feedback during visually guided finger movements in a finger-reaching task. We found that providing hand, virtual hand (VH) or shadow hand (SH) instead of point light (PL) or cursor (CU) feedback resulted in significantly faster movement initiation for three out of the four comparisons (not for VH vs. PL; Brand et al.,  ). Hence, the results of our previous study suggested that hand feedback might play an important role in visually guided movement control and in its underlying brain processes. However, no study has investigated the differences in brain activation between hand and cursor feedback during reaching movements. 

Also, it has not yet been determined whether observing a hand movement will lead to the same or different brain activations than performing the same hand movement. Rizzolatti and collaborators found in monkey ventral premotor (PMv or F5) and in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) so-called “mirror neurons,” which fired not only during the monkey’s hand movement but also during observation of the same movement performed by the experimenter (Rizzolatti et al.,  ,  ). The question of whether these cortical two brain regions in humans would also respond to observation of the hand movements has been investigated in a wealth of brain imaging publications. One of the first studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) demonstrated that observation leads to activation in several regions, namely bilateral premotor and also parietal cortices (Buccino et al.,  ). Iacoboni et al. ( ) also revealed that two human brain regions (i.e., inferior frontal and inferior parietal cortex) had mirror neurons properties, as they responded similarly for movement observation, imitation, and execution. These regions were named the mirror neuron system (MNS; Rizzolatti et al.,  ) or the action observation network (Buccino et al.,  ). Several further publications also reported activations only for observation of hand actions outside of the MNS, such as in the sensorimotor cortex (Szameitat et al.,  ) as well as in visual regions (Orlov et al.,  ; Bracci et al.,  ). 

In an early positron emission tomography experiment (PET), observation of grasping movements was delivered for three different types of hand feedback: real hand (RH), high-quality visual reality VRH, and low-quality VRL feedback (Perani et al.,  ). For all three experimental conditions, a large number of brain regions, some visual and others in the parietal lobe were activated. Enhancement in brain activation only occurred in the right IPL for watching real hand compared to virtual hand actions. Yet, an agent performed the movements in the scanner room and this could have induced other effects than purely feedback related ones. Other more recent publications also reported activation not only in the IPL but also in the anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and in the prefrontal cortex in visually guided grasping and in hand movements (Shmuelof and Zohary,  ; Pilgramm et al.,  ). 

There is further evidence that action observation of moving objects and hands lead to neural responses outside of the MNS (Engel et al.,  ) in higher visual cortex (Kaneko et al.,  ) and sensorimotor areas (Szameitat et al.,  ). Using fMRI, it was found that the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) is involved in the observation of stimuli including hands (Grill-Spector et al.,  ; Culham et al.,  ). It was also reported that the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) shows closely overlapping fMRI signals for observation of hands and tools (Bracci et al.,  ). Further, the visual area hMT+ plays a role in biological motion perception (Grezes,  ; Grossman and Blake,  ; Michels et al.,  ), including visually guided hand movements (Oreja-Guevara et al.,  ). The extrastriate body area (EBA)—a part of the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC)—is known for responding selectively to the observation of human bodies or body parts, including hands (Downing et al.,  ; Taylor et al.,  ). Importantly, the EBA can distinguish between self-generated and other generated hand movements, indicating that this region is not only responsive during the observation of visual stimuli (David et al.,  ). 

In the present fMRI study, we investigated brain activations associated with various visual feedback conditions actively and observed performed visually guided finger movements. By applying a virtual reality mediated feedback during the action, we could test for the impact of self-performed hand movements using very sparse (cursor and point-light) to realistic displays of index finger movements (shadow and virtual hand). We expected that execution as well as observation of hand movements would lead to the strongest activation during the realistic display of a hand. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Twenty-seven healthy paid volunteers participated in the study. We excluded eight subjects for the following reasons: two volunteers were co-authors, that were aware of the study hypotheses; two other volunteers demonstrated significant head motion (>3 mm in translation); in another four volunteers, coil artifacts were observed in the structural MRI. The remaining 19 subjects (seven females) were all right-handed as evaluated using the Edinburgh inventory (Oldfield,  ) and had a normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Subjects were on average 27.9 years (SD 7.4 years) old and provided written informed consent before participation. Our study was accepted by the Kantonale Ethikkommission Zürich and experiments were conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 


### Technical Setup 
  
The experiment setup is visualized in  . Parts of the setup have previously been described in our previous study (Brand et al.,  ). The experiment was performed with subjects lying in a wide bore (70 cm diameter) magnetic resonance scanner. Subjects fixated a rigid plastic tube in a power grip with their right hand. The tube was fixed to the scanner bed to assist in keeping the hand in a comfortable neutral position. This ensured that hand and finger positions were approximately consistent across participants. Tubes with three different diameters (5.1, 4.7, and 4.3 cm) were used to adjust for varying hand sizes. Index finger movements were recorded using a 5DT Data Glove 5 MRI (5DT Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) . We used Unity3D (version 3, Unity Technologies, San Francisco, CA, USA)  for data acquisition, data processing, and presentation of real-time visual feedback. Movement as well as task feedback were presented in real-time on an LCD monitor, which participants were able to observe   via   a mirror. An Eyelink 1000 long-range video oculography system (SR-Research Limited, ON, Canada)  was mounted underneath the monitor to record the movements of one eye. A nine-point calibration routine for the tracker was executed at the beginning of the experiment; data were recorded at 500 Hz.

Visual feedback was delivered   via   mirror projection from a monitor.   (B)   Visual feedback consisted of the display of the starting position (light-blue circle), of the movement cursor (skin-colored circle, approximately Type III on the Fitzpatrick scale), and the target (red circle) on grey background.   (C–F)   The experiment comprised eight conditions, with four different types of visual feedback.   (C)   Cursor (CU),   (D)   point light (PL),   (E)   shadow hand (SH), and   (F)   virtual hand (VH) feedback. 
  
Data from the sensor glove was acquired at 75 Hz. A moving average filter was applied for smoothing the input data over a 100 ms window. Smoothing was employed to remove the high-frequency noise from the sensory input, but we also added a delay of 50 ms to the recorded user input, which was not noticed by participants, as stated after the experiment. At every smoothed input sample, the three index finger joint angles were inferred using a lookup table. The angles were then applied to a realistic virtual hand model. Realistic joint angles of the finger flexion-extension movement task were acquired using motion capturing (Vicon, USA) in a separate single participant study preceding this experiment. In the pre-study, the single participant performed the movement task outside of the scanner and the joint angle mapping data for the movement was stored in the lookup table. Before the experiment, the sensor glove was calibrated for every subject at 100% and 0% index finger extension. The task was performed in the 95% to 5% index finger extension range. We report distances relative to this movement range in the course of this article. 

A realistic virtual hand model from the 5DT data glove software was used (2,450 polygons) for visual feedback of the finger movements. Virtual spheres, sized to approximate the thickness of the real index finger, were placed on the virtual index fingertip and finger joint positions. Four distinct hand feedback types were defined: 

CU ( ): invisible hand model, the tip of the index finger visible as a sphere (flat flesh-colored shading, orthographic 2D projection) 

PL ( ): invisible hand model, spheres on the joints of the index finger visible (flat flesh-colored shading, orthographic 2D projection) 

SH ( ): visible hand model with moving index finger, all spheres invisible (flat flesh-colored shading, perspective 3D projection) 

VH ( ): visible RH model with moving index finger, all spheres invisible (realistic shading, perspective 3D projection) 

We adjusted the visual angle of the task range on the screen for every subject to match the visual angle of the real finger movements in the lying task position. 


### Experimental Protocol 
  
Subjects were instructed to either observe or control the movements of the virtual index finger (hand or circles) projected on the screen. During the action conditions, participants controlled the virtual hand and circle stimuli by extending and flexing their right index finger. They were instructed to move the index finger and to stabilize the other fingers by holding the tube. During the observation conditions, subjects were resting their hand by holding the tube and they watched the pre-recorded and animated movements of the virtual effector on the screen. To control for finger and eye movements, we recorded sensor glove and eye-tracker data throughout the whole experiment (during the action as well as observation conditions). The task started with moving the cursor represented by a blue circle into the starting position ( ). After two s, the trial started with a red target circle appearing at a pseudo-random location (between 40–50% finger extensions). Starting and target position circles were displayed in different colors to facilitate distinguishing between the two visual positions, especially in observation conditions. In action conditions, participants were instructed to move the cursor as fast and accurately as possible to the target, and immediately back to the starting position. Each trial lasted 2 s, with the target circle disappearing after 1 s. The trials were grouped in blocks of nine and each block lasted 22 s comprised of 2 s task instruction, 2 s for moving the cursor into the starting position, and followed by nine trials of 2 s duration each. The blocks were interleaved with in-between resting periods of pseudo-random length (7–9 s, average 8 s) showing a blue fixation cross. The whole experiment consisted of eight conditions, each comprising ten blocks. Each condition contained a different feedback type for the task ( ) and additionally differed in whether subjects observed or performed (action) the movements. 

Randomly, one action and one observation condition were assigned to one of four scanning runs, such that by pseudo-random selection either the same feedback type or two different feedback types were used within one run. Within the runs, respective action and the observation condition blocks were presented in random order. To instruct subjects on the task, either the word “action” in red or the word “observation” in green was presented for 2 s before each block. In between runs, participants were allowed to take a short break, if required. The whole experiment lasted for approximately 1 h, including setup time. 


### Behavioral and Eye Data Analysis 
  
For behavioral and eye movement data analysis we used the same methodology as in our previously published behavioral study (Brand et al.,  ). Please refer to the previously published article for a detailed description of the procedure. In total, for behavioral data, we calculated four psychometric parameters for each index finger movement: movement amplitude, movement extent error (Euclidean distance between the virtual index fingertip and the target center), total movement time, and reaction time. Reaction time was operationalized as the time between stimulus presentation and visual movement onset. Movement onset was detected when 10% of the distance from the starting position to the target distance was exceeded. The parameter of movement onset and therefore reaction time includes the 50 ms lag of the moving average filter. For eye movements, we calculated seven parameters: number of saccades, fixations, blinks, horizontal and vertical gaze amplitude, median horizontal, and vertical gaze velocity. Statistical testing for the factor Condition was performed using the appropriate parametric (one-way repeated measures ANOVA or paired   t  -test) or non-parametric test (Friedman test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test). 


### fMRI Data Acquisition 
  
Scans were acquired using a Philips Ingenia 3.0 Tesla MR scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) with a Philips 32-element head coil. Functional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) sensitive images were obtained using a single-shot gradient-echo EPI (Mansfield,  ) pulse sequence (slices = 32, slice scan order: interleaved, repetition time = 2.2 s, echo time = 35 ms, flip angle = 90°, field of view = 230 × 230 mm , reconstruction voxel size = 2.9 × 2.9 × 4.4 mm , scan matrix 64 × 64). The images were recorded in an oblique axial orientation to reduce signal dropout and covered the whole brain. To homogenize the BOLD sensitivity of the fMRI scan, we applied sensitivity encoding with a reduction factor of one. Additionally, the possible number of slices acquired within one TR was maximized. Following the functional scans an anatomical scan was acquired, using a sagittal 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence (slices = 170, repetition time = 8.2 ms, echo time = 3.8 ms, flip angle = 8 degrees, field of view = 240 mm, voxel size = 0.94 × 0.94 × 1 mm, scan matrix 240 × 240). All images covered the whole brain. Each run lasted 10 min and 49 s and contained an observation and action condition. 


### fMRI Data Analysis 
  
We analysed the fMRI data with SPM8 . We discarded the first three dummy images of every fMRI run to obtain a magnetization steady-state and performed the following pre-processing steps: realignment to the calculated mean image, segmentation, normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template and smoothing by an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full-width at half maximum. The data was high-pass filtered with a cut-off frequency of 1/128 Hz. Subsequently, we performed for each participant a first-level trial-based analysis with a general linear model (GLM) as implemented in SPM8. For each subject, the design matrix consisted of eight regressors, corresponding to the trial onsets and durations (2 s) of the eight conditions, four amplitude parametric modulators, coding movement amplitude in the action conditions as described in the behavioral data analysis section and four constants for each fMRI run. The amplitude parametric modulators were included to remove global amplitude effects from the signal. The trial-based assessment of movement amplitude has been described previously (Brand et al.,  ). Subsequently, the regressors and parametric modulators were convolved with the hemodynamic response function. Also, we used eye movement parameters (i.e., number and durations of saccades, fixations, eye blinks as well as the amplitude and velocity in the translational and horizontal direction) as nuisance variables (covariate of no interest) in the second-level analysis. 

The fit of the GLM to the observed activity yielded parameter estimates for every subject, voxel, and regressor or parametric modulator. The beta values represent an estimate of activation for regressors and an interaction estimate of regressor activation with parameter value for parametric modulators. We then calculated the t-contrasts of each estimated regressor or parametric modulator compared to baseline. All resting periods of 7–9 s (average 8 s) in between blocks and 30 s at the beginning and the end of each fMRI run served as baseline for the GLM. 

We entered the resulting beta images into a second-level random-effects group analysis. The second-level design matrix consisted of eight regressors stemming from two factors of two and four levels, respectively. In particular, we used a 2 × 4 factorial design for the two-way ANCOVA with the factors   Condition   (action and observation) and   Feedback   (VH, SH, PL, and CU) to examine main and interaction effects. We also performed a conjunction analysis for factor   Condition  . As described, eye movement parameters were used as a nuisance variable. In the case of significant main effects (  F  -test),   post hoc   t-contrasts (paired, one-tailed) were performed. General task activations were assessed by calculating t-contrasts of combined action or observation regressors to baseline. For all analyses, we used the SPM implemented family-wise error (FWE) correction to find activated voxel-clusters with an overall type I error level of   p   < 0.05. The results were visualized on a cortical surface using the (PALS)-B12 atlas (Van Essen,  ) and the software Caret (Van Essen et al.,  ). 

We defined four literature-driven regions of interest (ROIs) in the left hemisphere with center coordinates taken from previous publications (see  ). MNI (MNI space) transformed coordinates for the EBA were taken from Orlov et al. ( ), for area hMT+ from Spiridon et al. ( ), for the LOC from Grill-Spector et al. ( ) and the LOTC from Bracci et al. ( ). To compare activations in the ROIs across conditions first-level beta values were extracted using MarsBaR 0.43  from 6 mm spheres around the peak coordinates for every subject and regressor. The ROI data were compared for feedback-specific effects by one-way repeated-measures ANOVAs and paired   t  -tests or by their non-parametric counterparts Friedman-tests and paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

## Results 
  
### Behavioral Data 
  
Overall, participants performed similar movements for the four visual feedback action conditions. In our previous article on 26 participants, we found faster reaction times (for three out of four comparisons), larger movement amplitudes, and larger movement extent errors for the hand compared to the circle conditions (Brand et al.,  ). Likewise, the behavioural results of the 19 participants studied in this article, revealed significant differences in one-way repeated measures ANOVAs for factor   Condition   in movement amplitude (  F   = 119.66,   p   < 0.001), movement extent error (  F   = 129.03,   p   < 0.001), and reaction time (  F   = 7.24,   p   < 0.001), but no significant effect on movement time. 

Additionally, in line with our previous report, movement amplitude was significantly larger in the two hand feedback conditions than in the two circle conditions (VH > PL,   t   = 12.40,   p   < 0.001; VH > CU,   t   = 13.18,   p   < 0.001; SH > PL,   t   = 11.77,   p   < 0.001; all   t  -tests; SH > CU,   V   = 190.00,   p   < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Accordingly was movement extent error (VH > PL,   t   = 12.89,   p   < 0.001; VH > CU,   t   = 13.32,   p   < 0.001; SH > PL,   t   = 11.98,   p   < 0.001; SH > CU,   t   = 14.11,   p   < 0.001; all   t  -test). 

As in our previous article, reaction time was significantly shorter for SH than for CU and point light conditions (PL > SH,   t   = 3.00,   p   = 0.010; CU > SH,   t   = 4.34,   p   = 0.002;   t  -tests). However, different to our previous study with 26 participants, in this study we could not find a significant effect on reaction time for virtual hand compared to cursor (CU > VH,   t   = 2.96,   p   = 0.050;   t  -test). All tests were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. 

To support our neuroimaging hypothesis, which compared both hand conditions combined to both circle conditions combined, we also investigated this contrast in behavior. In Bonferroni corrected   t  -tests, we found significantly larger movement amplitude (hands > circles,   t   = 16.02,   p   < 0.001) and movement extent error (hands > circles,   t   = 16.03,   p   < 0.001) as well as shorter reaction time for hand compared to circle conditions (circles > hands,   t   = 4.07,   p   < 0.001). 


### Eye-Tracking Data 
  
The median position of the subjects’ tracked eye stayed close to the endpoint of the controlled effector (circle or index finger) for all conditions. In median trajectories, differences between conditions and overruns were small, while differences between individuals were large. We investigated the differences between conditions with parameters acquired from the eye-tracking trace trial-by-trial. As the data was not normally distributed, non-parametric tests (Friedman or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) were used and the   p  -values were Bonferroni corrected for the number of tests performed. We did not find any differences for factor   Feedback   for none of the assessed parameters, neither for action nor for observation. However, for factor   Condition   (separating action from observation conditions), the number of saccades, fixations, and blinks were significantly different (all   p   < 0.05, Friedman tests).   Post hoc   analyses with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed a greater number of saccades (  V   = 175,   p   < 0.001), fixations (  V   = 179,   p   < 0.001) and blinks (  V   = 190,   p   < 0.001) during observation than action. 


### fMRI Data 
  
#### General Task Activation—Whole-Brain Analysis 
  
In the final sample of subjects (  n   = 19), head movements were small (all slice-specific translation values < 2 mm; rotation <2 degrees). The 2 × 4 ANCOVA yielded significant main effects for the factors   Condition   (  F   = 11.3,   p   < 0.001,   F  -test) and   Feedback   (  F   = 5.7,   p   < 0.001,   F  -test) but no interaction effects. We first analyzed the BOLD signal of all action and observation conditions and compared them to the baseline to assess general task effects. Both action and observation conditions activated the bilateral OTC ( ). Also, the conjunction analysis revealed a similar bilateral cluster in the OTC shown in ( ). The action conditions additionally activated bilateral cortical (motor, premotor, somatosensory, and parietal) and cerebellar regions (not shown) as well as ipsilateral thalamic regions ( ). These were located in the primary motor and somatosensory cortex, dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), PMv, supplementary motor area (SMA), precuneus, IPL, and in the cerebellum.

Primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortex, dorsal (PMd) and ventral (PMv) premotor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), precuneus, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), occipitotemporal cortex (OTC), and cerebellum predominantly activated. Activations are shown at   p   < 0.05 (FWE corrected). 
  

#### Feedback Effect—Whole-Brain Analysis 
  
 Post hoc   t-contrasts (paired, one-tailed) were then performed for the factor   Feedback   the following   post hoc   T-contrasts for each condition: VH vs. SH, SH vs. PL and PL vs. CU. Significant activations were only found for SH > PL and PL > CU in both action and observation conditions (  and  ). 
  
Illustration of the significant BOLD signal differences comparing feedback types. Activations are shown for both action   (A–C)   and observation   (D–F)   conditions overlaid on a left lateral rendered brain. Right-hemispheric activations were small and not shown. Activations of all plots were FWE corrected (  p   < 0.05). This figure illustrates that during the action and observation realistic displays of a human hand (SH and VH) activate the visual cortex more strongly than point-light (PL) or cursor (CU) displays. 
    
Peak activations for the action and observation conditions. 
  
 Hands summarize VH and SH. Circles summarize PL and CU. All results presented at   p   < 0.05 (FWE corrected) and peak voxels reported in MNI coordinates. The reported brain regions correspond to regions of the Anatomy Toolbox 2.2 (Eickhoff et al.,  )  . 
  
The SH > PL comparison significantly activated the lingual gyrus in both action and observation conditions. In action, the single activation cluster was larger in the number of activated voxels compared to observation and extended into the inferior occipital gyrus. 

PL > CU activated the lingual and fusiform gyrus for action and observation with the peak for action lying in the fusiform gyrus and the one for observation in the lingual gyrus (  and  ). 

SH > PL and PL > CU had no overlap in both action and observation conditions. 

To investigate the effect of seeing a hand on activations, we compared hands (VH, SH) vs. circles (PL, CU) by combining both hands as well as both circle conditions. The contrast hands > circles yielded significant activations in several brain regions (  and  ). 

The hands > circles contrasts of both action and observation had an activation cluster in the left (contralateral) occipital lobe, mainly in the lingual gyrus. For the action conditions, this cluster extended into the fusiform gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and cuneus. Additional activation clusters for action were found in the left precuneus and cuneus. The hands > circles activations contained all SH > PL activations, but not all PL > CU activations. 

In summary, we found stronger activations for feedback of hands than circles during both action and observation conditions, with larger activations in action. Many of these regions were also significantly activated by the SH > PL comparison. Disjoint from the SH > PL activations we found significantly higher BOLD signals for PL > CU feedback in early visual regions. 



### ROI Analysis 
  
As shown in  , the EBA showed significant activation differences between hand and cursor conditions in action (VH vs. CU,   t   = 4.49,   p   = 0.002; SH vs. CU,   t   = 3.84,   p   = 0.007;   t  -tests) and observation (VH vs. CU,   V   = 164,   p   = 0.024; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; SH vs. CU,   t   = 6.24,   p   < 0.001;   t  -test). We also found a significant difference between VH and PL in action (  V   = 183,   p   < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and between SH and PL in observation (  t   = 3.28,   p   = 0.025;   t  -test). 
  
Activations in four literature-driven (EBA, hMT+, LOC, and LOTC, see  ) left-hemispheric ROIs. Beta value means and standard errors extracted for VH (black), SH (gray), PL (dark red), and CU (light red) conditions during both action (top) and observation (bottom). Asterisks indicate significant changes between conditions (  p   < 0.05). Abbreviations: EBA, extrastriate body area; hMT+, human area MT+; LOC, lateral occipital complex; LOTC, lateral occipitotemporal complex. This figure indicates that during the action and observation realistic displays of a human hand (SH and VH) activate the literature-driven ROIs more strongly than point-light (PL) or cursor (CU) displays. 
  
Activation in hMT+ was higher for hands than for circles in action (VH vs. PL,   V   = 180,   p   < 0.001; VH vs. CU,   V   = 162,   p   = 0.032; Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; SH vs. PL,   t   = 3.00,   p   = 0.046;   t  -test; SH vs. CU,   V   = 173,   p   = 0.005; Wilcoxon signed-rank test).The LOC showed a decreasing activation gradient from VH to CU conditions in action ( ). Significant differences were found between the two hand conditions and the CU (VH vs. CU,   t   = 4.97,   p   < 0.001;   t  -test; SH vs. CU,   V   = 176,   p   = 0.003; Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and for VH compared to PL (  V   = 163,   p   = 0.027; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In observation, differences were only significant for SH vs. CU (  t   = 4.92,   p   < 0.001;   t  -test). 

For the LOTC, we found stronger fMRI responses for the   Feedback   types “hands” compared to “circles” for both action and observation. Significant differences were seen for action for two comparisons (VH vs. PL,   V   = 164,   p   < 0.024; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; VH vs. CU,   t   = 3.74   p   = 0.009;   t  -test). 



## Discussion 
  
The main aim of this study was to examine whether neuronal engagement depends on the realism of a human hand during action and observation. We found main effects of   Feedback   and   Condition  , but no interaction effects. This indicates that fMRI signal responses were different in action (visually guided hand movements) and observation and differed between feedback types. However, BOLD responses were similarly modulated by the different feedback types for action and observation. As expected, seeing a hand representation while performing index finger movements activated the known relevant sensorimotor and visual brain regions (when controlling for movement amplitude and eye movement parameters). Activations in visual regions were stronger for VH movements than for moving PL. The difference between the two types of hand feedback representations did not lead to measurable differences in brain activation. The observation did not activate as many regions as action and the activation was weaker during displays of moving PL. These results suggest that the engagement of the brain during virtually guided index finger movements is stronger and spatially more extended during the display of a hand compared to various PL displays. Unexpectedly, regions of the MNS were not seen during observation using our experimental design. Our results thus clearly suggest that visual feedback of virtually guided hand movements can robustly activate the MNS and the visual cortex. This finding might help to design experiments in which robust neuronal responses of the visual cortex are required. 

### Action vs. Observation: Regional Differences in Brain Activation 
  
In all four literature-derived ROIs (EBA, hMT+, LOC, and LOTC), we found stronger activation for a moving hand (VH and SH) compared to moving circle stimuli (PL and CU). For action and observation, the whole-brain comparison between hand (VH or SH) and circle (PL or CU) activated left occipital and occipitotemporal (LOC and LOTC) regions. The OTC is known for processing visual information about the human body (Downing et al.,  ,  ; Taylor et al.,  ; Lingnau and Downing,  ). This region has also been associated with action observation and performance (Caspers et al.,  ; Lingnau and Downing,  ) and has been proposed as an MNS region (Molenberghs et al.,  , ). Regions for visual processing of the body or body parts are known to exist in EBA (Downing et al.,  ) and FBA (Peelen and Downing,  ), which are both parts of the OTC. In our experiment, a hand display activates EBA more strongly than the two types of circle conditions during both action and observation. This is consistent with studies reporting EBA activation for observation of static as well as moving hands (Taylor et al.,  ; Op de Beeck et al.,  ; Orlov et al.,  ). Nevertheless, these studies only compared observation of hands to observation of objects. Our results extend their findings, as in our study EBA was active during both action and observation of hands compared to PL displays. 

We found that only during the action, hMT+ was activated for all hands and circle conditions. Studies have revealed that sub-regions of hMT+ also respond to the motion in other sensory modalities, such as tactile motion (Lingnau and Downing,  ). Thus, being considered a motion-processing region, one would expect hMT+ to be activated equally for all feedback types, and both action and observation. However, activations for PL and CU were significantly smaller during action compared to those for hand conditions. This finding could be related to a previous study that found hMT+ responding more strongly to the motion of body parts than to other objects (Spiridon et al.,  ). There is evidence that macaque’s MT is involved when motion energy is integrated into the visual field (global motion; Salzman et al.,  ; Pasternak and Merigan,  ), which is especially the case for the hand conditions in our experiment. Further, it has been proposed that hMT+ activations depend on the level of implicit motion (Kable et al.,  ). Hence, processing of motion from own actions—like in our action condition—might be different from the processing of motion from pre-recorded actions like in our observation, as the amount of implicit motion is absent in this condition. Feedback from own performed motion is required for visuomotor control by enhancing internal movement models (Shadmehr and Krakauer,  ). 

Especially for action, LOC activations were significantly stronger for the hand than circle conditions. Our results extend previous imaging findings showing that the LOC responds more to real objects compared to scrambled objects (Grill-Spector et al.,  ). During the observation, activation was the strongest for SH feedback and significantly different from CU feedback. Thus, any difference could be explained by the presence of a moving hand. 

In line with previous reports (Bracci et al.,  ,  ), we found hand-selective responses in the left LOTC, most pronounced for the VH condition during both   Feedback   types. Our results thus indicate that brain activation is driven by the observation of whole integrated real finger movements and visually guided real finger movements, and not by the movements of subparts of the hand (abstract subparts of the finger). 


### Behavioral and Eye-Tracking Data 
  
We found differences between the four action conditions in three psychophysical parameters: finger movement amplitude, extent error, and reaction time. Some of these results were previously presented (Brand et al.,  ). To remove the influence of behavioral effects on the fMRI data, we added a movement amplitude regressor of no interest as a parametric modulator to the first-level fMRI model. Our eye-tracking data analyses did not yield any significant differences between the four feedback conditions. Thus, any behavioral differences in amplitude and reaction time cannot be explained by differences in eye movements. However, differences between action and observation conditions were found in the number of saccades, fixations, and blinks, being larger for observation. This may be due to more focused attention during action than during observation. Eye movements are known to modulate activity in the frontal brain areas, such as the frontal eye field, as well as in parietal brain regions. The frontal eye field contains visual, motor, and visuomotor cells (Bruce and Goldberg,  ) essential for the preparation and triggering of eye movements. Transcranial direct current stimulation during saccade preparation over the IPS can alter general performance, e.g., during a discrimination task, which is not necessarily the case for the frontal eye field (Neggers et al.,  ; Van Ettinger-Veenstra et al.,  ). As we observed—for all action conditions—significant activation in somatosensory, motor, premotor, parietal, and occipitotemporal cortex even after controlling for eye movements, we would conclude that activation differences between action and observation are not the result of eye movements but is rather the result of (actively performed) visually-guided finger movements. 


### General Task Activations 
  
Controlling for movement amplitude and eye movement parameters, the visually guided finger movements significantly activated somatosensory, motor, premotor, parietal, and occipitotemporal cortex in the four action conditions ( ). In contrast, the observation of the various moving visual stimuli (hands, PL, and CU) on the screen only activated the OTC, but none of the reported MNS regions in the premotor and parietal cortex (Molenberghs et al.,  ). 

Several studies have questioned the involvement of the premotor-parietal cortical network in action observation because fMRI and PET did not all show activation in this network as clearly as in monkey experiments. There is evidence that many factors can shape and increase activity in the MNS network, such as novelty and experience (Liew et al.,  ), subtle differences in movement kinematics (Koul et al.,  ), intention and the context of observed motor action (Molenberghs et al.,  ). In an older study, individuals watched video clips showing object manipulation by the right or left hand (Shmuelof and Zohary,  ). The occipital cortex and caudal part of the parietal cortex demonstrated fMRI signal responses specific to the visual-field location of the clips. However, the response in anterior IPS was related to the identity of the observed hand. These “hand-specific” parietal areas also demonstrated contralateral hand specificity during self-action (i.e., object manipulation) without visual feedback. The authors concluded that the anterior IPS is involved in the observation of specific hand actions, including grasping. 

Most important are the publications reporting meta-analysis of many fMRI studies in the context of action observation and execution (Molenberghs et al.,  ; Hardwick et al.,  ). Morin and Grèzes ( ) reported that only observing biological actions with a physical target (compared to visual stimuli displaying no action at all) leads to consistent activation of the PMv (Morin and Grèzes,  ). Caspers et al.’s ( ) meta-analysis concluded that the activation in the PMv was only for observation objects-related actions (Caspers et al.,  ).To the same conclusion came the meta-analyses on imagery, observation, and execution by Hardwick et al. ( ), who found that one of the potential factors influencing activation in the network is the involvement of an object in the observed actions (Hardwick et al.,  ). The lack of activation in the premotor cortex in our study was surprising but could be explained by the conservative statistical threshold (  p   < 0.05, FWE) applied or is due to the missing object-related action in our experiment, in which we focused on simple reaching. 

We could not find any significant difference in brain activation between realistic (VH) and less realistic (SH) hand feedback, neither during action nor during observation ( ). This is consistent with a previous study (Perani et al.,  ). Yet, our results are not in line with another result of the same study. According to their experiment, the observation of RH feedback yielded stronger activation compared to a coarse VH (close to a robotic hand). However, this surprising result might be explained by the fact that the presented hand belonged to a human agent (located in the scanner room) rather than the display of a VH on the screen. In early visual regions, we did not find any activation differences between baseline and action or observation. This was probably due to the static visual stimulus (blue fixation cross) that subjects saw during rest periods. In both action and observation conditions, we found stronger activation along the visual cortex comparing the two-hand to the two point-light feedback conditions ( ). 



## Limitations 
  
As the four visual feedback types differed in size, this could explain some of the observed activation differences, especially in early visual regions. However, the contrast “PL > CU” conditions, comparing differently sized feedback, only evoked activation differences in the lingual gyrus and only during observation. Hence, it is unlikely that activation differences in the examined regions are driven by differences in the physical size of the stimuli. Also, the fMRI signal amplitudes in higher visual brain regions (ROI: EBA, hMT+, LOC, and LOTC) were stronger for all action than observation conditions. This result suggests that processing in these regions is associated with action understanding and cannot only reflect changes in the physical properties of the feedback types (Kilner,  ; Wurm et al.,  ). 

Second, activation differences between hands and circles might be related to differences in behavioral parameters, as observed for movement amplitude and reaction time (Brand et al.,  ). Yet, an amplitude parametric regressor of no interest was added to the first-level fMRI design to remove possible amplitude effects from the fMRI data. 

Thirdly, we recorded eye movement data and found that oculomotor parameters are known to be strongly correlated in humans with both alertness (blink frequency) and visual attention (fixation duration) did not significantly differ across feedback conditions. This limits the likelihood that participants’ attention differed in the four feedback types and would elicit stronger BOLD signal amplitude for hands compared to circles. Also, we controlled for the impact of eye movement parameters on brain activation in the statistical model for the fMRI analysis, to minimize the impact of eye-movement-related activation on task-related activation. 

Differences in luminance were not checked. However, the results clearly show that there was no activation difference between the VH and SH in all regions for action as well as observation, though potential differences in luminance. We did not record muscle activity by electromyography recordings. Yet, based on the sensor glove data we had detailed information on the movement trajectory and thus information about e.g., the movement extent error. 


## Conclusion 
  
Our study suggests that brain activation during visually guided finger movements depends on the visual representation of the movement on the screen. During action and observation, full-sized finger representations—whether realistic or shadow—lead to more activation in specific visual brain regions compared to point-light or cursor feedback. Our results can be important for the design of future computer-interactive and/or virtual-reality augmented training and rehabilitation systems.

# Abstract
 
The pathophysiology of essential tremor (ET) is controversial and might be further elucidated by advanced neuroimaging. Focusing on homogenous ET patients diagnosed according to the 2018 consensus criteria, this study aimed to: (1) investigate whether task functional MRI (fMRI) can identify networks of activated and deactivated brain areas, (2) characterize morphometric and functional modulations, relative to healthy controls (HC). Ten ET patients and ten HC underwent fMRI while performing two motor tasks with their upper limb: (1) maintaining a posture (both groups); (2) simulating tremor (HC only). Activations/deactivations were obtained from General Linear Model and compared across groups/tasks. Voxel-based morphometry and linear regressions between clinical and fMRI data were also performed. Few cerebellar clusters of gray matter loss were found in ET. Conversely, widespread fMRI alterations were shown. Tremor in ET (task 1) was associated with extensive deactivations mainly involving the cerebellum, sensory-motor cortex, and basal ganglia compared to both tasks in HC, and was negatively correlated with clinical tremor scales. Homogeneous ET patients demonstrated deactivation patterns during tasks triggering tremor, encompassing a network of cortical and subcortical regions. Our results point towards a marked cerebellar involvement in ET pathophysiology and the presence of an impaired cerebello-thalamo-cortical tremor network. 
 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
Essential tremor (ET) has recently been redefined as an isolated tremor syndrome characterized by bibrachial postural and/or kinetic tremor which has been present for at least 3 years and may affect other body parts (e.g. head, voice, lower limbs) but is not associated with other neurological signs (e.g., parkinsonism, dystonia, ataxia) . This is a refinement of previous definitions of ET, in which the coexistence of additional neurological signs of uncertain significance, now labelled as “ET plus”, was accepted as ET . Although the revised definition of ET has engendered debate among clinicians and researchers and is considered strict by some , it has some advantages in research settings, where the selection of highly homogeneous cohorts is a pivotal requisite when designing mechanistic studies and clinical trials. 

ET has an estimated prevalence of nearly 1% in the general population and 5% in people aged 65 and over, thus standing among the most common neurological disorders . Despite its high prevalence, controversy exists on the pathophysiology of ET . Several non-mutually exclusive pathomechanisms have been proposed so far . First, ET might represent a neurodegenerative disease with prominent involvement of the cerebellar cortex in keeping with neuroradiological and pathological evidence . Second, ET could be underpinned by a defective gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission which was demonstrated to partially colocalize with neurodegenerative changes, suggesting that both a reduction in GABA receptor density and alterations in GABA receptor functioning might contribute to lower the GABAergic tone . Third, ET might be secondary to abnormal oscillatory activity within a tremor-generating network including the inferior olive, cerebellum, red nucleus, thalamus, and sensory-motor cortex . 

In this context, advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide novel insights to shed light on the pathophysiology of ET . 

From a morphological perspective, while post-mortem pathological studies have demonstrated the presence of ET-related changes in cerebellar structures , the assessment of anatomical brain integrity in-vivo is more challenging and has been hampered by the quality of available data. Automatic techniques, such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM), can overcome these issues enabling to quantify local alterations in gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volume without a priori assumptions on tissue composition and to detect subtle alterations that elude visual inspection. However, previous studies relying on VBM to compare ET patients and healthy controls (HC) provided variable and inconsistent findings and call for further research . Indeed, ET has been associated with either GM volume loss in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres alone or along with other brain regions , or no differences in GM volumes , or increased GM volumes of the bilateral cerebellum and right occipital fusiform gyrus . 

Considering this broad spectrum of results, recent studies on ET shifted from the assessment of brain anatomy only to its combination with brain activity information, generally retrieved from functional MRI (fMRI) based on blood-oxygenation-level-dependant (BOLD) contrast. BOLD signals arise from the complex interaction of neuronal, metabolic and vascular processes and therefore provide an indirect measure of neuronal activity . Their acquisition can be obtained while the subject is resting in the scanner (rs-fMRI) or performing a task (task fMRI), conveying different information about the underlying brain activity. Rs-fMRI is a useful approach to explore brain functional organization and connectivity, but despite its undeniable relevance it cannot localize and lateralize spontaneous oscillations associated with different brain functions. Conversely, task fMRI enables to define brain areas which are involved in the execution of specific tasks by revealing perturbations of neuronal activity in terms of both increased (activation) and decreased (deactivation) BOLD signals . Functional evidence currently available on ET mainly derives from rs-fMRI , which demonstrated patterns of aberrant connectivity over several regions of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network. Few studies have hitherto investigated ET using task fMRI, especially in combination with motor tasks, and their findings are largely not comparable. This may reflect inconsistencies in ET patient selection due to the longstanding absence of stringent diagnostic criteria and the lack of ET biomarkers, different MRI field strengths, acquisition schemes (in terms of both paradigms and tasks), and analysis methods . In addition, previous task fMRI studies on ET focused only on BOLD activation patterns and did not explore deactivations, as frequently happened in the broader literature on fMRI. Negative BOLD responses were shown to reflect task-related decreases in neuronal activity compared to the spontaneous activity level at rest , and have been reported in association with different paradigms, especially those requiring a greater task effort . However, controversy still exists on their interpretation and whether deactivations reflect neuronal inhibition or hemodynamic compensatory mechanisms is still unclear, limiting the number of studies currently reporting their BOLD deactivation findings. 

Overall, examining brain regions whose activity increases or decreases with tasks is highly important to understand how the brain works, and in the specific context of ET could help to unveil which regions are involved in tremor generation and propagation. Therefore, this study aimed to explore activation and deactivation brain mapping using task fMRI combined with a tremor-inducing motor task in a homogeneous cohort of ET patients diagnosed according to the most recent and stringent criteria . These maps were also assessed with respect to physiological patterns derived from HC, aiming at identifying functionally relevant modulations, and linked to clinical data to assess whether a linear relationship between imaging and clinical manifestation exists. Finally, VBM was performed to quantify possible ET-related changes in terms of GM volume. 


## Results 
  
### Participants 
  
Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients and controls are reported in Table  . All patients with ET had bilateral arm tremor which was often mildly asymmetrical in amplitude on clinical assessment, being slightly worse in the dominant arm. Two patients showed associated mild head tremor in line with the inclusion criteria, four patients had also vocal tremor, and three patients had lower limb involvement. A family history of postural and/or kinetic tremor of the upper limbs was reported by seven ET patients. Age, gender, handedness, Beck Depression Inventory II score (BDI-II) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score for trait anxiety (form Y2) were not significantly different among the two groups (  p   > 0.05).

### VBM analysis 
  
Significant volume loss was observed in ET patients compared to HC (  p   < 0.05, family-wise-error [FWE]-corrected) as revealed by the VBM analysis. The atrophy pattern predominantly involved the cerebellar structures, revealing four different clusters. The first cluster (  p   = 0.013, 1488 voxels), centered in the left lobule VIIIa, encompassed a broad area across vermis VIIIa, left lobule VIIb and Crus II. The second one (  p   = 0.004, 1050 voxels) involved vermis VIIIa, right Crus II, lobule VIIIa, and lobule VIIb, where the peak voxel was found. The left and right Crus I areas also showed a statistically significant volume reduction in patients relative to HC (  p   = 0.028, 135 voxels and   p   = 0.036, 43 voxels, respectively). In particular, the latter cluster also spread to the right lobule VI. Finally, a single cluster of cortical atrophy of the right occipital fusiform gyrus was found, although being of a limited extent (  p   = 0.043, 14 voxels; Figure  ).

### Task fMRI: general linear model (GLM) and statistical analyses 
  
All participants completed the experimental paradigms and the analysis of the head motion parameters reported no statistically significant changes in terms of movement across groups (task 1 ET vs HC; task 1 in ET vs task 2 in HC) or tasks (task 1 vs task 2 in HC). Indeed, Supplementary Materials Table   shows that the means of the time course for the six movement parameters are limited with no significant group/task differences (  p   > 0.05). 

Group GLM results are summarized in Supplementary Materials Tables  – , while the statistical comparisons for (de)activations are reported in Tables  – . In particular, each significant cluster identified by the group/statistical analyses (  p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected) is reported with its name, the number of voxels, the value of the maximum   z  -statistic within the cluster, and the location of the maximum intensity voxel, given as X/Y/Z coordinate values in MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) standard space coordinates (mm).

### GLM group analysis 
  
 Control subjects  . Both activations and deactivations could be observed in the HC group. In particular, in task 1 the outstretching of the right arm was associated with significant bilateral activations of the cerebellum (mainly homolaterally over lobules I–VI, VIIIa, and Crus I), frontal and subcortical areas, such as caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus. Activations limited to the contralateral cortical motor areas were also found (pre/postcentral gyri), and a homolateral activation of the temporal areas and insula was detected (Figs.   and S2, Table S2). Considering the deactivations associated with this task, a significant bilateral involvement of frontal and occipital areas plus cerebellum (mainly contralaterally over Crus I/II) could be detected in task 1 (Figs.   and S2, Table S3).

Statistical maps are thresholded by using clusters determined by Z > 6 (activations) and Z < − 6 (deactivations) with a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   p   < 0.05. 
  

In task 2, the voluntary oscillation of the right wrist induced significant and extensive bilateral activations of the cerebellum (lobules V–VI and Crus I), cortical motor areas (pre/postcentral gyri, supplementary motor areas), and subcortical regions (thalamus and caudate nucleus). Predominantly contralateral activation of frontal areas, and homolateral activation of the insula were also detected in this condition (Figs.   and S2, Table S2). When considering the deactivation, limited albeit significant deactivated clusters could be observed mainly over the contralateral frontal and posterior areas (as posterior cingulate gyrus) (Figs.   and S2, Table S3). 

 Patients  . In the ET group, postural tremor on extension of the right arm was mainly associated with extended bilateral activations of the frontal pole and caudate, contralateral activation of the pre/postcentral gyri, and with homolateral activation of frontal areas (precentral and middle frontal gyri), cerebellum (lobules V, VI, VIIIa, VIIIb, Crus I), temporal areas, and parietal opercular cortex (v, Table S2). In addition, a massive and unique cluster of deactivations was found, encompassing in particular the main motor areas, posterior areas and subcortical structures. Finally, an extended deactivation over the cerebellum was mainly detected in bilateral Crus I/II, left lobule VI, and left VIIb (Figs.   and S2, Table S3, Figure  ). 


### Statistical analysis: between-group within-task comparison 
  
When comparing the areas elicited by task 1 in the two groups, we found few clusters of significantly higher activation in ET patients compared to HC, mainly over the bilateral frontal pole and precentral gyrus. Conversely, widespread significantly stronger deactivations were observed, especially in the bilateral Crus I/II (with contralateral predominance), contralateral lobules V, VI and VIIb, pre/postcentral gyri, supplementary motor areas and subcortical structures (as caudate and thalamus) (Figs.   and S3, Table  ).   
Statistical comparisons for activations and deactivations. Brain areas statistically different across groups (patients with essential tremor [ET] and healthy controls [HC]) and tasks are illustrated in figure and color-coded by statistical significance. Activations and deactivations were compared separately in the statistical analyses, and significant clusters were determined by Z > 4 (activations) and Z < − 4 (deactivations) with a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   p   < 0.05. Top: between-group comparison (task 1 ET vs HC). Bottom: between-group between-task comparison (task 1 ET vs task 2 HC). 
  

On the other hand, HC showed few clusters of stronger activations in the homolateral cerebellum (mainly lobules I–V), hippocampus, contralateral postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor areas, thalamus, and caudate nucleus as well as few voxels of significantly higher deactivation mainly in the contralateral frontal pole (Figs.   and S3, Table  ). 


### Statistical analysis: between-group between-task comparison 
  
The between-group between-task comparison (task 1 in ET vs task 2 in HC) demonstrated few areas of significantly higher activations in patients compared to HC mimicking the tremor mainly over frontal and temporal areas bilaterally. Conversely, ET patients showed a large cluster of significantly higher deactivations spreading across the two cerebellar hemispheres (8734 voxels). In particular, as shown in Figs.   and S4, this cerebellar cluster extends mainly over the bilateral Crus I and Crus II, and contralateral lobules I–VI, VIIb, and IX. ET patients also showed a large cluster of significantly higher deactivation (~ 6000 voxels) mainly encompassing contralateral pre/postcentral gyri, lateral occipital cortex, thalamus, caudate nucleus, and putamen. A subset of these regions in the homolateral cerebral hemisphere were also more strongly deactivated in ET patients, resulting in a cluster of 2014 voxels. 

The simulated tremor in the HC group was mainly associated with a stronger activation of the motor circuit compared to patients, in particular over the bilateral cerebellum (lobule VI and Crus I), homolateral lobules I–V, VIIb, VIIIa and Crus II, pre/postcentral gyri, and supplementary motor areas. Finally, few small clusters of significantly higher deactivations were found over the occipital areas for task 2 in HC compared to task 1 in ET (Fig.  , Table  ). 


### Statistical analysis: within-group between-task results 
  
For the within-group between-task comparison in HC, activated voxels were significantly higher in the homolateral temporal areas, paracingulate gyrus, and in the contralateral frontal pole during extension of the right arm (task 1) compared with voluntary oscillation of the right wrist (task 2). In addition, we found significantly higher deactivations in contralateral postcentral gyrus, and lateral occipital cortex (Figures S5–S6, Table S4). A single cluster of deactivation limited to the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere was also found for task 1 > task 2 statistical comparison (134 voxels), encompassing lobules VIIb, VIIIa, and Crus I/II which are engaged in sensorimotor and cognitive processes. 

Conversely, activations induced by task 2 were significantly higher than task 1 in several areas of the motor circuit, revealing extensive clusters over contralateral pre/postcentral gyri and supplementary motor areas. Bilateral, albeit predominantly homolateral, cerebellar changes were also present, mainly encompassing bilateral lobule VI and corresponding vermis, along with homolateral lobules V, VIIb, VIIIa, and Crus I. Contralateral lobule V and Crus I were also more strongly activated during task 2 compared to task 1. These cerebellar regions are involved in motor, sensorimotor, and cognitive processing. Significantly higher deactivations over the bilateral temporal pole and posterior/frontal areas were finally found (Figures S5–S6, Table S4). 


### Task fMRI linear regression analysis with Fahn–Tolosa–Marin tremor rating scale (TRS) scores 
  
Detailed results of the regression analyses are reported in Supplementary Table  . In particular, the clusters resulting from the voxelwise linear regression, subsequently masked with the BOLD (de)activations from the group analysis on ET patients, are indicated with their name, location of the maximum intensity voxel (X/Y/Z coordinates in MNI standard space), voxel size, correlation (r-value) and slope regression coefficient (beta value) together with their associated false-discovery-rate (FDR)-corrected   p  -values. The results for two representative regions (one activated and one deactivated as revealed by the group GLM analysis for task 1) are shown in Fig.  , reporting the negative relationship between the BOLD   z  -statistic values and the TRS, part A + B.   
Linear regression analysis. Regression results for two representative regions of interest are reported, one resulting as activated in the general linear model analysis for task 1 in patients with essential tremor (right pre/postcentral gyrus [PRG.r/POG.r]) and one as deactivated (left posterior cingulate gyrus [CGp.l]). Individual BOLD results, expressed as   z-  statistic values, were linearly regressed against the Fahn–Tolosa–Marin Tremor Rating Scale (TRS), part A + B. The correlation value (r-value) and the corresponding false-discovery rate (FDR)-corrected   p  -value (  p  ) are also reported. 
  

A negative correlation between the TRS scores and BOLD values was found in all cases. Of note, only clusters with r-value < − 0.8 are here reported (with   p   < 0.001 in all cases), while all the significant clusters are detailed in Table S5. A negative strong correlation with the TRS, part A was observed in a number of activated areas, including the right inferior/middle frontal gyri (r = − 0.923), anterior cingulate cortex (r = − 0.879), left pre/postcentral gyri (r = − 0.898), and in few deactivated areas, encompassing part of the left pre/postcentral gyri (r = − 0.891) and the right posterior cingulate gyrus/precentral gyrus (r = − 0.861). 

The TRS, part A + B was negatively correlated with similar areas as before. For the activated areas, a negative linear relationship was found for several frontal areas (left and right anterior cingulate cortex/superior frontal gyrus/frontal pole with r = − 0.918 and r = − 0.859, respectively; right inferior/middle frontal gyri with r = − 0.892) and motor areas (right and left pre/postcentral gyri with r = − 0.905 and r = − 0.803, respectively). For deactivation, a high correlation was found over the left posterior cingulate gyrus (r = − 0.923). 

Finally, a negative correlation existed between the TRS total score and a number of activated areas, including the right inferior/middle frontal gyrus/precentral gyrus (r = − 0.876) and the left central opercular cortex (r = − 0.840). A negative correlation with the TRS total score was also observed in some deactivated areas, including the left posterior cingulate gyrus (r = − 0.829). 



## Discussion 
  
This study explored in-vivo morphological and functional brain modulations associated with ET in a homogeneous cohort of patients diagnosed according to the 2018 consensus criteria  by using VBM and task fMRI. VBM showed few clusters of focal GM atrophy in both cerebellar hemispheres with respect to HC, but these regions did not overlap with activated/deactivated brain areas on fMRI. In addition, ET patients displayed statistically different activation and deactivation mapping when tremor triggered by maintaining a posture with their right arm (task 1) was compared with both the same task and the simulation of tremor (task 2) in HC. As novel finding, ET patients revealed a widespread deactivation circuit associated with the postural component of their tremor, encompassing several motor areas (e.g., pre/postcentral gyri, supplementary motor areas and cerebellum) and subcortical structures (e.g., thalamus and putamen). Finally, a linear negative relationship between imaging (BOLD   z-  statistics) and clinical variables (TRS scores) was found over several areas, reaching high significances. 

From a morphological perspective, a significant GM volume loss (atrophy) was detected in posterior lobules of both cerebellar hemispheres in ET patients compared with HC, although not overlapping with the activated/deactivated cerebellar clusters shown in ET. These findings revealed the presence of a quite symmetric pattern of atrophy involving mainly, albeit not exclusively, cerebellar regions engaged in non-motor processing (sensorimotor, attention/executive functions, default-mode) . A much smaller cluster of significant GM atrophy was localized to the right occipital fusiform gyrus in the ET group. 

Several studies have hitherto investigated ET patients through VBM providing variable and inconsistent results . In some agreement with our findings, quite a few studies reported GM volume loss in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres either isolated or associated with GM density reduction in other brain regions, such as occipital lobes . Moreover, Bhalsing et al. detected GM volume reduction covering the anterior and posterior lobules of the cerebellum bilaterally in ET associated with cognitive impairment . On the other hand, several studies did not show any differences in GM cerebral and cerebellar volumes between ET patients and HC , whereas others reported increased GM volumes of the bilateral cerebellum  and right occipital fusiform gyrus  in ET patients. Discrepancies among studies might be attributable to patient selection reflecting, among others, less stringent diagnostic criteria for ET in the past, as well as to different MRI field strengths and heterogeneous anatomical sequences acquired in the populations . In order to minimize all these possible confounding factors and derive reliable information, in our age-matched case–control study we enrolled a homogenous cohort of ET patients, relied on high-resolution volumetric anatomical images at 3 T and analyzed the data using state-of-the-art methods with a very stringent multiple comparison correction. All these elements allowed us to provide clear evidence in favor of a modulation of GM volume in specific areas of the cerebellum, as the analysis revealed nearly isolated clusters of cerebellar GM density reduction in our ET population which may be interpreted as regional atrophy in the context of a neurodegenerative disorder. Our VBM results might add some evidence to post-mortem findings of pathological changes in the cerebellar cortex, including reduction of Purkinje cell number, in several series of ET patients , thus supporting the pathophysiological hypothesis that ET is a neurodegenerative disorder centered in the cerebellum. 

From a functional perspective, main findings from our study are that: (1) postural tremor visible in ET patients with the right arm outstretched (task 1) was associated with significantly higher activation of bilateral frontal areas compared to task 1 and simulated tremor with the right arm outstretched (task 2) in HC; (2) ET patients during task 1 showed significantly higher deactivation of cerebellar regions engaged in both motor and non-motor processing, sensory-motor cortex, and basal ganglia bilaterally compared to task 1 in HC; (3) postural tremor in ET patients was associated with an increased deactivation of the cerebellum (again in lobules associated with motor and non-motor processes), sensory-motor cortex, lateral occipital cortex, thalamus, and caudate nucleus bilaterally compared to task 2 in HC. The consistency of these findings was supported by the use of highly conservative statistical thresholds with correction for multiple comparisons, aiming at uncovering only the most reliable possible activations/deactivations and significant differences. 

Few evidences on task fMRI in ET are available so far. Indeed, only seven studies have hitherto investigated ET using fMRI with a motor task and their findings are largely not comparable among each other neither to the results from this study due to inconsistencies in patient selection, differences in the acquisition scheme (mainly paradigms and tasks) and analysis methods . Our study appears partly comparable with only two previous fMRI studies sharing nearly identical motor tasks . Bucher et al. performed quite a pioneering study on a 1.5T MRI scanner and applied a different analysis approach, focusing on the temporal correlation between the time course of each voxel and the stimulus protocol rather than using GLM analyses, as widely done nowadays. In contrast to our findings, Bucher et al.  reported a significantly increased activation in the cerebellar hemispheres and ipsilateral red nucleus during tremor in ET patients compared to mimicked tremor in HC. No between-group differences were found in the activation of primary sensory-motor areas, globus pallidus, thalamus, and dentate nucleus. Likewise our study, Broersma et al.  used a block-related paradigm and similar tasks, although they added EMG recordings which were further used in their analyses to infer both block-related and tremor-related fMRI activations. Broersma et al.  detected block-related activations in the homolateral cerebellum, namely right lobule V, VI, and VIIIa, which further extend to right lobule VIIIb and the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere (left lobule V, VI, VIIb, and IX) when tremor-related analysis was performed. In our study, we found similar clusters of activations in the homolateral cerebellar hemisphere, although their extension was lower possibly due to the more restrictive statistical threshold we used in our analysis (  p   < 0.05 FWE-corrected vs   p   < 0.001 uncorrected). On the contrary, we mainly found deactivated regions in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. 

In the present study, concerning the activated areas in task 1, ET patients showed stronger activations over several frontal areas compared to HC performing the same task or simulating the tremor (task 2). Frontal areas are involved in planning motor action, movement initiation, maintenance, and planning of complex sequences. Moreover, neural activation patterns among these regions are involved in executive functioning and verbal working memory. Some preliminary studies demonstrated abnormally enhanced responses of prefrontal and parietal cortices in ET patients compared to HC while executing attentional and working memory tasks . This was also confirmed with rs-fMRI, revealing enhanced functional activity in specific resting state networks, such as the frontoparietal network, which correlated with increased disease severity, disease duration, and reduced cognitive ability . Likewise, our results demonstrate the presence of an increased activity in frontal and prefrontal regions in ET patients while performing a tremor-inducing motor task which might require an additional level of attention for them. In other terms, we speculate that ET patients need to exert greater control to maintain their right arm outstretched in a fixed position due to presence of postural tremor compared to HC. This is also in agreement with a recent study on Parkinson’s disease and ET assessing the cortical activity patterns during bimanual tapping with EEG recordings . The authors found in the ET group an increased task related power in frontal areas involved in movement initiation and planning of complex sequences, confirming that ET patients require more attention, focus and control for correctly performing specific hand movements compared to HC. 

To the best of our knowledge, previous studies on task fMRI in ET have never reported BOLD signal decreases (deactivations), having focused only on activation patterns. This parallels the broader literature on task fMRI, which rarely reported on BOLD deactivations because of analysis methods which did not highlight them and/or difficult interpretations of their significance. Negative BOLD responses were previously shown to reflect task-related decrease in neural activity compared to the spontaneous activity level at rest . However, since statistical areas are obtained from the comparison between an active and a rest condition, it is difficult to determine whether decreased BOLD signals are pointing towards the deactivation of brain areas during the experimental task, as generally considered nowadays, or the activation of the same areas during the rest condition. Interpretations of BOLD deactivations are still controversial, and can be summarized into two main categories:   
Deactivations might represent a direct hemodynamic consequence (‘blood stealing’) occurring in response to flow changes in adjacent brain areas, since negative BOLD signals have previously been demonstrated to correspond to either local flow decreases  or transient redistribution of blood within a neural network ; 
  
Deactivations could represent an inhibition process (i.e., an active suppression of neural activity in order to minimize the influence of other task-irrelevant neural processes) as revealed by several studies which show a relationship between negative BOLD signals and decreases in neural activity, therefore suggesting that this phenomenon is predominantly neuronal in origin and not driven by vascular steal . 
  

Despite controversies, BOLD deactivations have gained increasing interest since their formalization by Raichle et al. almost twenty years ago . In this seminal paper, the authors proposed that the deactivation pattern may resemble a default state of the brain, involving areas whose activities are attenuated and/or suspended during specific and attention-demanding tasks. This peculiar deactivated map, called default-mode network (DMN), involves the posterior cingulate cortex, the medial frontal cortex and the angular gyrus region of the inferior parietal cortex, and has been replicated in numerous studies. However, further studies with cognitively demanding tasks proved that the deactivation patterns only marginally encompass the DMN, extending beyond this specific network on regions that are responsive to changes in task demand, such as the insula . Tasked-related deactivation is thus not limited to a fixed set of specialized regions and can occur in any brain region that is not apparently involved in controlling or processing the specific task . These findings are consistent with our observations which demonstrated for the first time in ET a widespread deactivated network associated with postural tremor, including areas of the DMN, sensory-motor network, cerebellum and deep structures as insula, amygdala and thalamus, further confirming the presence of a disrupted cerebello-thalamo-cortical tremor network. In addition, the widespread deactivation network observed in the present study might reflect the spatial/temporal interaction between the DMN and other task-specific functional areas. When focusing on the cerebellum, a predominance of contralateral fMRI deactivations was found in ET patients. The interpretation of the present findings is controversial and remains purely speculative in view of the controversy on the significance of fMRI deactivations in previous literature and the lack of previous studies reporting fMRI deactivations in ET. The critical role of the cerebellum in the control of voluntary limb movements and movement-related sensory data acquisition has previously been established . In addition, great emphasis has been given to cerebellar dysfunction/pathology in ET . Overall, our findings on reduced cerebellar activations in ET patients compared to HC would support an ET-related impairment of cerebellar circuitry. In particular, during task 1, we found a significantly lower activation of the homolateral cerebellar hemisphere in ET compared to HC. We therefore speculate that the predominant contralateral deactivations in ET patients may represent an attempt of their underfunctioning homolateral hemisphere to gather its remaining capacity to fulfil its physiological role, i.e. controlling a task triggering tremor and therefore initiating acquisition of additional tremor-related sensory data. This is likely to represent a higher demanding sensorimotor processing compared to that required in HC. Following our speculation and considering the possible significance of negative BOLD responses, we might hypothesize that deactivations represent a direct hemodynamic consequence (‘blood stealing’) or an active suppression of neural activity possibly occurring to prioritize/maximize task-relevant neural processes in the homolateral cerebellar hemisphere. 

Overall, deactivations can unveil relevant aspects of tremor generation and should be explored in future research on larger cohorts of patients with ET, as this study reveals some extent of overlap between deactivated areas and previous pathological findings showing neurodegeneration in the same areas . As additional proof of the altered functionality of these areas, some of them within the motor system showed altered connectivity patterns on previous rs-fMRI studies, which mainly revealed decreased connectivity within the cerebellum and an opposite trend over the pre/postcentral gyri, anterior cingulate and supplementary motor areas . 

Finally, the assessment of a possible linear relationship between tremor scales and BOLD (de)activations (expressed as   z-  statistic values) revealed significant negative correlations over several voxels and regions. When focusing on the activated areas resulting from the GLM analysis, ET patients with low tremor scores showed higher activations, whereas for increased tremor scores they showed a tendency to lower activation or even a shift to deactivation, with highly negative   z  -values for those patients with severe tremor. Conversely, when considering the deactivated areas, almost all patients revealed no activation and negative   z-  values which tended to become higher in absolute value as the tremor severity and body distribution increased. Therefore, the higher the severity and number of affected body segments the strongest the deactivation. These findings hold for all the three TRS subscores considered in the linear regression analysis, thus highlighting the different patterns of activations/deactivations at different level of tremor severity and body distribution and that more severe patients present a more disrupted tremor network. 

In order to verify whether the mild inter-side difference in tremor severity might have determined differences in the intensity of fMRI modulations, we performed a correlation analysis between the intensity of fMRI (de)activations and the Fahn–Tolosa–Marin TRS, part A scores for both the right and left upper limb separately. In addition, we performed a correlation analysis between the intensity of fMRI (de)activations and the normalized tremor asymmetry index which was calculated as reported elsewhere . The first analysis confirms significantly negative correlations for both sides as found for the overall TRS-A score. In the second analysis, we did not find any significant correlation. These observations suggest that the mild inter-side difference in tremor severity is unlikely to have determined relevant differences in the intensity of fMRI (de)activations. The severity of tremor itself rather than its asymmetry appeared therefore related to fMRI modulations. 

We acknowledge that this study has several limitations. First, the small sample size of the study cohort may have limited statistical power to identify less robust effects. However, compared to previous studies, we enrolled a highly homogeneous cohort of patients with ET diagnosed according to the 2018 strict consensus criteria. Second, our ET cohort has later onset and short disease duration than in previous studies of advanced neuroimaging in ET and this needs to be considered when comparing findings. However, our study seems to capture the later peak of the bimodal distribution of ET age of onset which is well established in previous literature . Third, we did not use an MRI-compatible electromyography to determine the frequency of simulated tremor in HC, although the performance of the movement was monitored by an operator throughout the entire acquisition. Finally, considering again the relatively small number of patients studied, the linear regression analyses need to be replicated using a larger sample to further confirm our findings of an inverse relationship between tremor scales and BOLD values, which however already reached a very high statistical significance. 

In conclusion, application of combined VBM and task fMRI to a homogeneous cohort of patients with ET demonstrated the involvement of cerebellar areas and clear patterns of widespread deactivations in tasks triggering tremor, which encompassed both cortical and subcortical regions. Limited temporal resolution of BOLD-based fMRI prevents the identification of primary tremor generators or oscillatory mechanisms. However, taken together, our findings provide support for the key role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of ET and for the presence of a loop involved in tremor generation, encompassing known structures as cerebellar hemispheres, cortical motor areas, thalamus and pallidum. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Ten ET patients (6 males, 69.4 ± 8.9 years) were consecutively enrolled at the Movement Disorders Centre of the University Hospital of Verona, Italy. ET was diagnosed according to the 2018 consensus criteria . Exclusion criteria were: presence of moderate to severe head tremor (score > 2 on the Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale) ; presence of rest tremor and/or other neurological signs; presence of cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State Examination  24); history of neurological or psychiatric diseases; current or past exposure to tremorgenic drugs; contraindication for MRI. In ET patients who were taking medications for tremor, drugs were stopped at least 72 h before the study session, which consisted of clinical assessment and MRI scanning performed on the same day. Ten age-matched healthy subjects (5 males, 67.7 ± 7.8 years) with no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases and unremarkable neurological assessment were recruited as controls. 

Participants were asked to avoid caffeine, theine, and alcohol intake over 12 h preceding the study session. ET patients and HC gave their written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the local Ethics Committee for Clinical Sperimentation (CESC) of Verona and Rovigo (no. 1482CESC) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2008). 


### Clinical assessment 
  
Age of onset, disease duration, family history of ET or other neurological diseases, and effect of alcohol on tremor were collected. ET patients underwent a throughout neurological assessment by a movement disorder specialist and tremor was rated using the Fahn–Tolosa–Marin TRS . TRS includes three parts. Part A was used to assess tremor amplitude in different body sites (items 1–9, score: 0–84), part B to examine handwriting, drawing, and pouring (items 10–14, score: 0–36), and part C to evaluate the burden of tremor on activities of daily living (items 15–21, score: 0–28) . Assessment of depression and anxiety in both ET patients and HC was obtained by the self-administered questionnaires BDI-II (score: 0–63, higher score indicates more severe depression) and STAI Y2 for trait anxiety (score: 20–80, higher score indicates greater trait anxiety) . 

As for demographic and clinical data, absolute and relative frequencies were tested by Fisher’s Exact test. For continuous data, descriptive statistics are reported in terms of means and standard deviations and comparisons between groups were performed using non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test due to the small sample size (  p   < 0.05). All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS® Statistics (version 21.0). 


### Experimental protocol and image acquisition 
  
ET patients and HC underwent MRI scanning on a 3T system (Philips Achieva, Philips Medical Systems, Netherlands) equipped with an 8-channel head coil. They laid supine inside the bore of the scanner with their arms along the body and forearms pronated. The head was stabilized with adjustable padded restraints on both sides. Subjects were instructed to remain as still as possible and to keep their eyes closed throughout the experiment. 

In ET patients, block-designed BOLD fMRI was performed during the execution of a motor task, i.e. maintaining the right arm outstretched leading to the appearance of tremor (task 1). Conversely, HC were scanned during two separate block-designed paradigms: (1) while maintaining the right arm outstretched, as in ET patients (task 1); (2) while mimicking a tremor through flexion–extension of the right wrist at the highest frequency they could reach with the arm outstretched (task 2). As previously reported , the mimicked tremor task in controls should be considered as the optimal voluntary motor task for comparisons with the postural tremor in ET patients. Participants were externally cued to switch from rest (arms along the body) to active task and back to rest by the auditory inputs “start” and “stop” presented via headphones and monitored in real-time by one evaluator. To ensure that tasks were performed as accurately as possible, all participants were trained for several minutes before undergoing MRI and monitored by an examiner throughout the whole acquisition. 

Task fMRI data were acquired using 2D gradient-echo echo-planar imaging and the following parameters: TR/TE = 2000/30 ms; 36 slices, 3 × 3 × 4 mm , no slice gap, FOV = 192 × 192 mm ; flip angle = 75°. Each block-designed paradigm consisted of thirteen 20 s cycles of rest alternated with thirteen 20 s cycles of task, for a total of 260 volumes. A 3D T1-weighted turbo field echo scan was finally acquired for each subject (TR/TE = 8.16/3.73 ms; 180 slices, 1 × 1 × 1 mm , no slice gap, FOV = 256 × 256 mm ; flip angle = 8°). 


### VBM analysis 
  
VBM analysis was performed using the optimised FSL-VBM protocol available in FSL 5.0.9 ( ) . T1-weighted images were brain-extracted (BET) and segmented into GM, WM and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using the FMRIB’s Automated Segmentation Tool FAST. GM maps were affine-registered to the GM ICBM-152 template, concatenated and averaged across study subjects. This averaged image was flipped along the x-axis and the two mirror images re-averaged to obtain a first study-specific GM template. Individual GM images were subsequently non-linearly re-registered to this template, concatenated, averaged, and flipped along the x-axis. Both mirror images were finally averaged to create the symmetric, study-specific GM template (2 × 2 × 2mm , MNI space). Afterwards, each individual GM image was non-linearly registered to the study template, modulated to compensate for the contraction/enlargement due to the non-linear component of the transformation and smoothed (Gaussian kernel, sigma = 3 mm). A permutation-based non-parametric inference (5000 permutations) with the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) option was finally performed to statistically compare the GM images of the two groups. The significance level was set at   p   < 0.05 and corrected for multiple comparisons (FWE). 


### fMRI data analysis and statistical comparisons 
  
Functional data were first minimally preprocessed using FSL 5.0.9. The pipeline included head motion correction (MCFLIRT), non-brain tissue removal (BET), spatial smoothing (isotropic Gaussian filter with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 6 mm ), and high-pass temporal filtering for removing slow drifts (0.01 Hz). Participant head motion profiles (three translations and three rotations) were statistically compared across conditions in order to test for possible differences in one or more motion parameters (non-parametric Wilcoxon tests,   p   < 0.05). Preprocessed data were registered to the T1-weighted image by applying a linear registration (FLIRT) with boundary-based registration (BBR) cost function . Each T1-weighted image was then registered to the 2-mm MNI standard space using a non-linear method (FNIRT). Finally, the joint BOLD/T1-weighted and T1-weighted/MNI transformation parameters were used to spatially normalize the functional data. 

To identify activated/deactivated voxels at the single-subject level, a GLM analysis was performed . The stimulus-related regressor in the design matrix was assumed to be a vector describing the BOLD effect changes for the motor tasks. This was obtained by convolving the boxcar waveform, representing the experimental protocol, with a hemodynamic response function modelled by a canonical double-gamma function. Moreover, in order to account for movement-related artefacts and other non-neuronal fluctuations not completely eliminated by preprocessing, the six motion parameters from MCFLIRT were included as nuisance confounds in the design matrix, along with the average WM and CSF signals. These two regressors were calculated as the average of time courses within the corresponding tissue masks generated by segmenting the spatially normalized structural images (FAST) and thresholding the tissue probability maps at 0.9. Moreover, we took the probability of GM volume as further voxelwise covariate. 

For each subject, a t-test was applied to create a   z  -statistic map for each dataset. These lower-level statistical maps were fed into the higher-level group analysis (FEAT). For task 1, a fixed-effects (FE) analysis was applied to estimate the group results in ET patients and HC, highlighting both the activated areas related to the task, and the deactivations. The high-level statistical maps were thresholded using clusters determined by Z > 6 (activations) and Z < − 6 (deactivations) plus a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   p   < 0.05. A separate FE analysis was applied to the HC data for task 2 (same statistical threshold as for task 1). 

Three statistical analyses were finally performed to compare the identified brain areas: (1)   between-group analysis   (task 1 in ET patients vs HC); (2)   between-group between-task analysis   (task 1 in ET patients vs task 2 in HC); (3)   within-group analysis   (task 1 vs task 2 in HC). All these statistical maps were thresholded using clusters determined by Z > 4 (activations) and Z < − 4 (deactivations) plus a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   p   < 0.05. 


### fMRI linear regression analysis with TRS 
  
Regression analysis was carried out (fsl_glm) to voxelwise assess whether a linear relationship exists between TRS scores and BOLD (de)activations in ET patients. In particular, part A, A + B and A + B + C (total) of the TRS were separately considered as clinical variables in a linear regression. For fMRI, individual   z-  statistic maps resulting from lower-level single-subject analysis were used as representative values of BOLD (de)activations. For each analysis, resulting   p  -values were corrected for multiple comparisons (FDR) and only corrected   p  -values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. These statistical maps were finally masked using (de)activation clusters resulting from the patient group analysis, in order to restrict the assessment of the clinical/imaging link to the areas elicited by task 1.

# Abstract
 
Neural processing of visual food stimuli is perturbated at extremes of weight. Human fMRI studies investigating diet effects on neural processing of food cues could aid in understanding altered brain activation in conditions of under‐ and overnutrition. In this preliminary study, we examined brain activity changes in response to 10 days of high‐calorie‐diet (HCD), followed by 10 days of fasting, hypothesizing that HCD would decrease activation in homeostatic and reward regions, while fasting would increase activation in homeostatic/reward regions and decrease activation of self‐control regions. Seven adults completed fMRI scanning during a food‐cue paradigm (high‐ and low‐calorie food images and nonfood objects), pre‐ and post‐10‐day HCD. Six adults completed fMRI scanning pre‐ and post‐10‐day fasting. BOLD response changes for contrasts of interest pre‐ versus post‐intervention in regions of interest were examined (peak‐level significance set at p(FWE)<0.05). BMI increased by 6.8% and decreased by 8.1% following HCD and fasting, respectively. Following HCD, BOLD response in the hypothalamus (homeostatic control), was attenuated at trend level in response to high‐ versus low‐calorie foods. Following fasting, BOLD response to food versus objects in inhibitory‐control areas (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) was reduced, whereas the activation of homeostatic (hypothalamus), gustatory, and reward brain areas (anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex) increased. Overfeeding and fasting for 10 days modulate brain activity in response to food stimuli, suggesting that in healthy adults, changes in energy balance affect saliency and reward value of food cues. Future studies are required to understand this interaction in states of unhealthy weight.

## INTRODUCTION 
  
The regulation of appetite and food intake is a complex process governed by neural and endocrine signaling in response to energy balance, motivational drive, interoceptive cues, as well as cognitive and attentional processing of external sensory cues. Human neuroimaging studies demonstrate that in healthy individuals, states of hunger and satiety can modulate and bias the neural processing of visual food cues of different caloric value. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the brain response to high‐ versus low‐calorie visual food images after an overnight fast, healthy participants demonstrated hyperactivation of the hypothalamus, the primary homeostatic control region, as well as brain areas involved in visual processing (inferior temporal visual cortex), attention and motor control (posterior parietal cortex and premotor cortex, and memory (hippocampus) (Cornier et al.,  ). Additionally, activation in reward‐ and interoception‐related brain areas such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the insular cortex is increased in response to palatable food images following a short‐term (3 hr) fast (Frank et al.,  ) as well as an overnight fast (Fuhrer et al.,  ; Goldstone et al.,  ) with positive correlations between the duration of caloric deprivation (1 to 16 hr) and degree of neural activation in the OFC, as well as brain areas of attention (anterior cingulate cortex), motivation (putamen), and motor control (precentral gyrus) (Stice et al.,  ). 

In comparison, satiation produces a robust decrease in food‐cue elicited brain activity in reward‐related areas (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and anterior fusiform gyrus) (LaBar et al.,  ) as well as increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an area primarily involved in decision making and exerting inhibitory‐control over hedonic drives (Thomas et al.,  ). Interestingly, when overfed by 30% above caloric need for 2 days and then evaluated after an overnight fast, healthy‐weight individuals demonstrated attenuated hypothalamic activation to high‐calorie visual food images compared with robust activation seen after 2 days of controlled eucaloric diet (Cornier et al.,  ), suggesting that interoceptive signals reflecting physiological needs appropriately bias the cognitive perception of visual food images (Burgess et al.,  ). 

While there is ample evidence that healthy‐weight individuals exhibit changes in brain activation in response to visual food images following an overnight fast and postprandially, well‐controlled studies examining fMRI brain activation in response to prolonged (>2 days) fasting and high‐calorie diet interventions resulting in measurable, acute weight changes in humans are lacking. Such studies could improve our understanding of the adaptive neuronal mechanisms in response to more prolonged caloric restriction and overfeeding resulting in weight changes, and thus create the foundations to better understand the neuronal perturbations that occur at extremes of eating behavior, for example, chronic starvation and hyperphagia. 

The aim of the present pilot study was to examine changes in fMRI activation in response to 10 days of overfeeding intended to result in 7%–10% weight gain, followed by 10 days of complete caloric deprivation, separated by a 2‐week interval of unsupervised diet. We hypothesized that in healthy men and women, excessive caloric consumption leading to acute weight gain would result in diminished fMRI activation of homeostatic and reward regions important for food processing specifically in response to high‐calorie food images, whereas complete caloric deprivation resulting in acute weight loss would lead to increased activation of homeostasis and reward areas and decreased activation of inhibitory control brain regions in response to images of food varying in caloric content. 


## METHODS 
  
### Subjects 
  
Healthy, adult participants were recruited as part of a multidisciplinary study designed to examine the effects of acute weight changes on skeletal and marrow adipose tissue remodeling. All subjects included in the current fMRI study performed both diet interventions—overfeeding and fasting, in the same order (for details, see Procedure). Seven subjects (2 men, 5 women; mean age ±   SEM  : 31 ± 2.9 years; mean BMI ±   SEM  : 26.4 ± 0.5 kg/m ) completed fMRI scanning pre‐ and post‐10‐day HCD. Six subjects (1 man; 5 women; mean age: 29 ± 1.9 years; mean BMI: 26.6 ± 0.6 kg/m ) completed fMRI scanning pre‐ and post‐10‐day fast. Overall, three participants performed all four scans (prior and following each diet intervention). Subjects were recruited through online advertisements. Inclusion criteria included 101%–120% of ideal body weight (to avoid a potential negative impact due to the fasting intervention) and regular menses for women (cycling every 21–35 days). Exclusion criteria included a history of chronic illness, untreated thyroid dysfunction, history of an eating disorder, active substance abuse, abnormal transaminase levels (AST/ALT), hypokalemia (potassium < 3.5 mEq/L), pregnancy, breastfeeding, and MRI contraindications. Due to the main study aim to investigate bone health, participants taking medications known to affect bone metabolism (e.g., systemic steroids and immunosuppressants) were excluded from the study. 


### Procedure 
  
This study was approved by the Partners HealthCare Institutional Review Board and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was preregistered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02482519). All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation, obtained by a licensed physician investigator or nurse practitioner. Subjects were admitted to the Translational and Clinical Research Center (TCRC) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for an outpatient screening visit including a medical history, physical exam, and blood work to determine eligibility. Eligible subjects were admitted to the TCRC for the main study visits which occurred over the course of 35 days. The main study included an initial 10‐day inpatient HCD weight‐gain period (days 1–11), followed by a 13–18 day outpatient unsupervised diet (“wash‐out,” days 11–24), followed by a 10‐day inpatient fast (days 25–35). During the HCD intervention, subjects were fed a high fat/high carbohydrate diet individually tailored to result in a 7%–10% weight gain, planned and supervised by an experienced bionutritionist at the TCRC. The amount of daily calories ordered for each participant was established by calculating the Basal Metabolic Rate (using the Mifflin St Jeor equation) and adding 20% on top of the final result to achieve a positive energy balance (Frankenfield et al.,  ). During the overfeeding intervention, the study nutritionist examined the daily percent change in body weight and evaluated meal completion to assess the need for diet modifications. When participants were able to fully complete their meal but did not gain enough weight, food items were altered to increase the daily caloric consumption. When participants were struggling to complete their meal, a high‐calorie milkshake was added in addition to their meal. After a wash‐out period, subjects were readmitted to the TCRC for a 10‐day fast, using a validated protocol (Fazeli et al.,  ). During fasting, subjects were given water ad libitum, 20 meq of oral potassium chloride daily to prevent hypokalemia, and a multivitamin. During the inpatient portions of the study, subjects were free to move around the TCRC or remain in their room where they had a TV. Participants remained inpatient for 24hr following the fasting intervention to gradually increase caloric intake under medical supervision. All subjects were blinded to their weights during the entire study. 


### Functional MRI Paradigm 
  
Brain fMRI was performed after an overnight fast on the first and last day of both diet interventions. A urine HCG test was completed in females prior to scanning. fMRI scanning was performed during a well‐established food motivation paradigm (Holsen et al.,  ) programmed through Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems). Briefly, at each visit, subjects viewed 100 high‐calorie food stimuli, 100 low‐calorie food stimuli, 100 non‐food‐related household objects, and 100 fixation stimuli (blurred images) in a block design, with each stimulus presented for 3 s. Subjects were instructed to press a button when pictures changed to ensure attention. A total of five 4‐min runs with five images in each block and 16 blocks in each run were completed at each visit. At each of the pre and postintervention visits, subjects viewed images from one of two parallel versions of the task (each with 400 unique images from the conditions above), with order randomized across subjects. 


### MRI Acquisition Parameters 
  
MRI data were acquired using a Siemens 3T Trio scanner (Siemens) at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. A gradient‐echo EPI pulse sequence was used (33 contiguous oblique‐axial slices, 4‐mm thick, TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, flip angle = 90°, FOV = 200 × 200 mm, 120 total images per run). A sagittal 3D SPGR (T1‐weighted) sequence was acquired (TR/TE = 2350/3.39 ms, flip angle = 7°, FOV = 256 × 256 mm, effective slice thickness = 1.33 mm with 128 slices) for co‐registration between structural and functional datasets. Head movements were restricted with foam cushions. 


### Data analysis 
  
fMRI data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging). Volumes were realigned and unwarped with phase correction provided from the fieldmap, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute MNI152 brain template, re‐sampled to 3 mm isotropic, and smoothed with a 6 mm Gaussian kernel. Outliers in the global mean image time series (threshold: 3.5   SD  ) and movement (threshold: 0.8 mm, scan‐to‐scan movement) were detected using ART ( ) and entered as nuisance regressors in the single‐subject level GLM. Masks excluding voxels outside the brain were applied to ensure that voxels in regions with signal dropout were not arbitrarily excluded. For the block design, each stimulus type was modeled using a boxcar function convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Contrasts of interest (food > objects; high‐calorie food > low‐calorie food) from the first‐level analysis were tested using linear contrasts and SPM t‐maps, then submitted to second‐level random‐effects group analysis. The contrast of high‐calorie food > low‐calorie food was chosen as the contrast of interest for the pre‐ versus post‐HCD analysis based on the prediction that this contrast would be uniquely sensitive to changes induced by the high‐calorie diet foods consumed during the HCD intervention. Conversely, the food > objects contrast was selected for the pre‐ versus post‐fasting analysis based on the expectation that this more general contrast would be specifically sensitive to changes induced by lack of intake of any food during the fasting intervention. Effects of interest at the group level were examined using paired   t  ‐tests (pre‐ vs. post‐HCD; pre‐ vs. post‐fast). For transparency, post hoc complementary analyses were completed to examine changes in response to food > objects contrast for the pre‐ to post‐HCD intervention, and changes in response to high‐calorie food > low‐calorie food contrast for the pre‐ to post‐fasting intervention. For each set of analyses, region of interest (ROI) analyses were performed using small volume correction which corrects for the number of voxels within an anatomical ROI. Multiple comparisons were controlled using a combination of cluster extent (k ≥ 5 in hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens; k ≥ 20 in other ROIs) and   p   < .05 FWE‐corrected thresholds. ROI were selected a priori and included the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, OFC, amygdala, insula, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Anatomical borders of the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, OFC, amygdala, and insula were defined using a manually segmented MNI brain [based on methods established by the Center for Morphometric Analysis at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School (Makris et al.,  ,  ). Anatomical borders of the DLPFC were derived from Middle Frontal Gyrus region as defined by the AAL atlas (Tzourio‐Mazoyer et al.,  ). Average parameter estimates within each ROI for each participant were extracted from clusters within each ROI meeting statistical thresholds using the Region of Interest Extraction Toolbox (REX) and exported to SPSS (v19, Chicago, IL) for graphical depiction. 



## RESULTS 
  
Mean BMI increased by 6.8%±0.7 following HCD, was almost fully restored at the end of the wash‐out period and decreased by 8.1%±0.6 following the fasting intervention (see Table  ). Following HCD intervention, hypothalamic BOLD response was attenuated at a trend level in response to high‐ versus low‐calorie food images (Table  ; Figure  ). There were no regions in which BOLD response to all food images   (high‐calorie + low‐calorie)   versus objects changed significantly following HCD intervention.

## DISCUSSION 
  
In this preliminary, proof‐of‐concept study, we showed for the first time that when healthy adults were exposed to 10 days of extreme diet intervention associated with acute weight changes, they demonstrated altered neural processing of visual food images in brain regions involved in homeostatic control, reward, interoception, and inhibitory control. Specifically, following an overfeeding intervention associated with a mean BMI increase of 6.8%, subjects exhibited trend‐level attenuated hypothalamic activation, reflecting homeostatic control, in response to high‐ versus low‐calorie foods. Conversely, 10 days of fasting induced a mean BMI decrease of 8.1%, reduced activation in response to food images versus objects in inhibitory control areas (DLPFC), and increased activation in homeostatic (hypothalamus), interoception (anterior insula), and reward valuation (orbitofrontal cortex) brain regions. There is strong evidence that in healthy individuals, fMRI activation in food motivation brain areas is altered in states of short‐term hunger and satiety (Cornier et al.,  ; Frank et al.,  ; Goldstone et al.,  ; LaBar et al.,  ). However, the majority of these studies examined the effects of an overnight fast or a meal on the brain response to food cues and were not associated with a change in weight status. Our novel study design allowed an evaluation of the neurobiological response to visual food images following a relatively prolonged diet intervention resulting in significant acute weight changes, thus more closely mimicking extremes of disordered eating leading to unhealthy weight and associated co‐morbidities. 

In our study, following 10 days of overfeeding, subjects demonstrated trend‐level attenuated hypothalamic activation in response to high‐calorie versus low‐calorie food images. The hypothalamus is critically involved in integrating internal homeostatic signals with external cues and input from high‐order brain regions important for emotional, cognitive, and reward processing and it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity (Roth et al.,  ; Thaler et al.,  ). More specifically, rodent studies show that caloric excess triggers an inflammatory hypothalamic response altering the intricate neuroendocrine hypothalamic network regulating appetite and energy balance (Razolli et al.,  ). Hypothalamic inflammation is associated with the proliferation of glial cells which can be detected in human structural MRI studies. Signs of hypothalamic gliosis and inflammation can be seen in adults and even children with obesity and are positively associated with adiposity (Schur et al.,  ; Sewaybricker et al.,  ). fMRI studies provide further insight into the hypothalamic perturbations associated with obesity. While healthy‐weight individuals demonstrate dose‐dependent reductions in hypothalamic fMRI signal following glucose ingestion (Smeets et al.,  ) and in response to high‐calorie food images following overfeeding for 2 days (Cornier et al.,  ), individuals with overweight/obesity do not show the same hypothalamic response (Cornier et al.,  ; Matsuda et al.,  ). Our finding of trend‐level attenuated hypothalamic activation in response to high‐ versus low‐calorie food images following 10 days of caloric excess, suggests that differential hypothalamic responsivity to external food cues representing divergent rewarding value is maintained following 10 days of overfeeding associated with weight gain. These findings are of interest since rodent studies show that 3 days of high‐fat diet are sufficient to induce proinflammatory hypothalamic response associated with altered mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity as well as impaired functional and molecular activation of insulin‐signaling pathways (Jais & Bruning,  ; McLean et al.,  ; De Souza et al.,  ). 

The prolonged fasting intervention implemented in our study provides a model through which to understand restrictive eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa (AN), a condition associated with severe, chronic starvation. AN is associated with dysfunction of appetite‐regulating brain areas (Lloyd & Steinglass,  ), including hypoactivation of these areas (e.g., insula, OFC, and hypothalamus) in response to high‐calorie foods after a 12‐hr overnight fast (Holsen et al.,  ) and hyperactivation of the DLPFC in response to high‐calorie food images (Brooks et al.,  ). Altered reward and interoceptive processing of hedonic food cues (e.g., palatable food images and tastes of sucrose) as seen in fMRI studies and following a 12–16 hr fast also exists in women who remitted from AN, thus eliminating a confounding factor of malnutrition on food motivation neurocircuitry response and supporting pathological inherent mechanisms facilitating extended periods of food avoidance (Holsen et al.,  ; Kaye et al.,  ). Our subjects demonstrated clear hyperactivation of homeostatic and food motivation brain areas as well as hypoactivation of the DLPFC following 10‐day fasting, which we speculate could provide a neural signature of the state of acute starvation in otherwise healthy adults. Since most fMRI studies designed to learn about differences in food‐cue processing between AN patients and healthy controls were conducted following a short‐term fast, our study adds to the literature by providing greater resemblance to the prolonged starvation associated with weight loss seen in AN. Additional studies are needed to further delineate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of chronic starvation observed in AN. Our study design may also provide important information regarding neurobiological features of food processing in atypical anorexia nervosa (AAN), a relatively new diagnosis introduced in the DSM‐5 (APA,  ). Patients with AAN have similar features to patients with AN (e.g., significant food restriction and intense fear of weight gain), however, they are not underweight; rather, they have BMIs in the normal to overweight/obesity range (Matthews et al.,  ; Moskowitz & Weiselberg,  ). fMRI studies examining food cues processing in patients with AAN are lacking. Future studies comparing fMRI responses to food cues in patients with AAN compared to BMI‐matched controls could provide important knowledge regarding perturbation in the neurocircuitry of eating behavior in AAN. Finally, it is also important to note that prolonged fasting (greater than ~14 hr), is associated with significant cellular, metabolic and endocrine adaptions that could potentially affect appetite and subsequently fMRI activation in response to visual food stimuli. Prolonged fasting is associated with a “metabolic switch,” transitioning from using glucose and carbohydrates as fuel sources for both body and brain to fatty acids and ketones (Mattson et al.,  ). It is also associated with marked changes in appetite‐regulating hormones such as leptin, insulin, ghrelin, and cortisol (Freire & Alvarez‐Leite,  ; Rajpal & Ismail‐Beigi,  ; Steinhauser et al.,  ). Future studies comprehensively evaluating both neural activation to food stimuli together with neuroendocrine adaptation to prolonged fasting will be important to conduct. 

Our findings are limited by the small sample size, although the significant effects observed following the diet interventions suggest adequate power for the statistical analysis approach implemented in this pilot study. Additionally, to avoid the potential harmful consequences of the fasting intervention, participants recruited to this study were on average slightly overweight (101%–120% of ideal body weight). Since chronic obesity is associated with altered fMRI brain activation in response to high‐calorie food images (Devoto et al.,  ), the mild excess weight of the participants could have affected the results seen in our investigation. Another limitation relates to the known gender differences in visual processing of food images in hunger and satiety (Chao et al.,  ) that we could not capture in our small sample. It is also important to note that three of the total number of subjects who participated in this study performed both fMRI evaluations (pre‐ and post‐overfeeding and fasting), and we cannot exclude a confounding effect of the familiarity with the visual stimuli presented during the fMRI task. Finally, the brain activation observed following fasting in this study could have been impacted by the prior high‐calorie diet intervention which all subjects received due to the study design. Future similar studies could include a randomized, crossover study design to minimize the potential confounding effect of participating in the two diet interventions in the same order (overfeeding followed by fasting). 

In summary, our preliminary, novel findings demonstrate that 10 days of extreme diet intervention modulate brain activation in regions related to homeostasis, reward, interoception, and inhibitory control in a nutritional status‐dependent manner. A comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the neurophysiology underlying states of hunger and satiety in healthy individuals could support research of disordered eating.

# Abstract
 
The hippocampus plays a key role for episodic memory. In addition, a small but growing number of studies has shown that it also contributes to the resolution of response conflicts. It is less clear how these two functions are related, and how they are affected by hippocampal lesions in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Previous studies suggested that conflict stimuli might be better remembered, but whether the hippocampus is critical for supporting this interaction between conflict processing and memory formation is unknown. Here, we tested 19 patients with MTLE due to hippocampal sclerosis and 19 matched healthy controls. Participants performed a face-word Stroop task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) followed by a recognition task for the faces. We tested whether memory performance and activity in brain regions implicated in long-term memory were modulated by conflict during encoding, and whether this differed between MTLE patients and controls. In controls, we largely replicated previous findings of improved memory for conflict stimuli. While MTLE patients showed response time slowing during conflict trials as well, they did not exhibit a memory benefit. In controls, neural activity of conflict resolution and memory encoding interacted within a hippocampal region of interest. Here, left hippocampal recruitment was less efficient for memory performance in incongruent trials than in congruent trials, suggesting an intrahippocampal competition for limited resources. They also showed an involvement of precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex during conflict resolution. Both effects were not observed in MTLE patients, where activation of the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex instead predicted later memory. Further research is needed to find out whether our findings reflect widespread functional reorganization of the episodic memory network due to hippocampal dysfunction.

## Introduction 
  
Only a small proportion of our experiences is transferred into long-term memory. How long-term memory encoding interacts with cognitive control and which brain areas support their relationship has been studied, but many questions remain ( ;  ). 

In explicit learning tasks, attention improves memory encoding. Conversely, explicit memory performance deteriorates when subjects perform a demanding secondary task ( ;  ). This suggests that cognitive control and memory encoding recruit similar resource-limited neurocognitive processes in frontal and parietal regions ( ). By contrast, in implicit learning tasks, even highly demanding tasks which rely on brain structures that support memory functions may improve memory encoding ( ). For example, a task-switching paradigm caused impaired memory for task-relevant but improved memory for task-irrelevant information ( ). This suggests that memory performance depends on the selectivity of attention, i.e. in the context of task-switching, the ability to maintain a stable task set and to effectively shield the relevant stimuli from distraction. 

An influential theory of conflict monitoring and cognitive control postulates that conflict in information processing signals reinforcement of top-down control of attention to the current task, which helps resolving conflict ( ). This theory further assumes that while the anterior cingulate cortex provides the conflict signal, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) underlies cognitive control mechanisms that enhance attention to task-relevant stimuli ( ). As a result, stimuli that are presented with incongruent distractors should trigger enhanced selective attention and improve memory encoding of the relevant stimulus. We tested this hypothesis in a previous study that combined a face-word Stroop paradigm with a delayed incidental memory task ( ). Trial-unique male and female faces were overlaid with congruent or incongruent distractor words (the words “man” or “woman”). This study showed that processing incongruent trials elicited behavioral costs (i.e., longer reaction times), but also improved later memory performance for the relevant stimulus. Conflicts induced activation of a common cognitive control network, including dlPFC and precuneus, and recruitment of these areas was associated with a memory benefit for face stimuli in conflict trials. Furthermore, functional coupling between these areas and the medial temporal lobe was associated with improved memory of incongruent items. These results suggest that prefrontal and parietal brain regions support control processes and exert a top-down modulation of hippocampus mediated memory encoding, highlighting the hippocampus as a crucial link between response conflict resolution and memory encoding. 

In a series of studies, we recently investigated the role of the hippocampus in higher-order cognitive control processes such as response conflict resolution. We found that in healthy participants, the left hippocampus is recruited during the resolution of response conflicts ( ). Patients with a mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) due to hippocampal sclerosis had an impaired conflict resolution performance ( ). In these patients, we further observed a reduced recruitment of the left hippocampus that contributed to the deterioration in performance ( ). These studies suggest that the hippocampus is indeed required for the resolution of cognitive response conflicts. However, whether and how these effects relate to the memory function of the hippocampus remains unclear. Specifically, it is still an open question whether hippocampal dysfunction in MTLE patients affects the interaction between conflict resolution and memory encoding. 

Here, we employed the previously established paradigm by   in MTLE patients and healthy controls to further explore the interaction between conflict resolution processes and memory encoding. First, we tested whether stimuli that evoke a response conflict are subsequently better remembered than control stimuli in a delayed incidental memory task and whether this effect differs between controls and MTLE patients. If cognitive control mechanisms recruited during response conflict resolution promote memory encoding ( ) and MTLE patients exhibit reduced conflict resolution performance ( ), one would expect them to also show a reduced memory benefit for conflict stimuli. Second, we tested whether brain regions recruited during response conflict resolution predicted subsequent memory performance. In our previous study, we found increased functional coupling between prefrontal and parietal conflict processing regions on the one hand and the medial temporal lobe on the other hand in healthy participants ( ) which we interpreted as a top-down modulation of hippocampal memory encoding. In the present study, applying the same paradigm in healthy controls and hippocampus-lesioned patients allowed us to test whether conflict processing specifically provided by the hippocampus further contributes to improved subsequent memory performance. We predicted that a reduced conflict-induced hippocampal recruitment due to medial temporal lobe dysfunction affects the memory benefit for conflict stimuli. We further explored whether functional connectivity of the hippocampus differs between MTLE patients and healthy controls. 


## Methods 
  
### Subjects 
  
 N   = 22 patients with MTLE according to International League Against Epilepsy criteria ( ) participated in the study. These patients are identical with those from our previous study ( ). Two patients were excluded from the study due to their extremely low accuracies in the Stroop task. One additional patient did not remember any faces and was excluded as well. The final group consisted of 19 patients (age: 45.3 ± 14.7 years; 8 females; age at seizure onset: 29.7 ± 13.2 years; disease duration: 15.2 ± 13.5 years). All patients underwent neurological examination, EEG and structural MRI as part of their clinical diagnostic procedure. Based on EEG and seizure semiology, 17 patients were diagnosed with unilateral MTLE (left MTLE:   n   = 7; right MTLE:   n   = 10), two patients had a bilateral MTLE. Nine patients received antiepileptic drug (AED) monotherapy, 10 patients were on polytherapy (for AED dosages, please see supplemental patient characteristics in Table S1). Patients with multifocal epilepsy, comorbid neurological diseases or severe psychiatric disorders were excluded. 

In addition to patients,   n   = 19 age matched healthy controls participated in the study (age: 45.8 ± 13.5 years; 9 females). Subjects with a neurological or psychiatric disease, a central nervous system-active medication or cerebral lesions were excluded. 

All participants gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Ärztekammer Westfalen-Lippe and University of Muenster (reference 2016 - 004 - f - S). 

As described previously ( ) the structural MRI scans received concordant evaluations by two radiologists following a standardized protocol to assess signs of hippocampal sclerosis ( ). Healthy subjects did not show any signs of hippocampal sclerosis. In MTLE patients, radiological findings of individual MRI scans are described in the Supplemental Results (Table S1). Results of the volumetric analyses confirmed the qualitative findings of the radiologists with respect to the lateralization of the hippocampal lesion (see Supplemental Results, Table S3). 


### Experimental procedure 
  
The participants underwent functional MRI scanning using an adapted version of the face-word Stroop paradigm from a previous fMRI study ( ). This version of the task featured conflict and non-conflict trials, but no neutral trials (faces overlaid with an unrelated word) in order to reduce overall memory demands for this sample including patients. 

#### Familiarization and training 
  
Prior to the MRI session, the participants performed a familiarization task for all face stimuli that were later presented in the face-word Stroop task. A pre-exposure to the stimuli of the fMRI task appeared necessary for two reasons. First, MTLE patients are significantly impaired in episodic memory ( ). We aimed to avoid floor effects and moreover to equalize baseline levels so that conflict modulation can be observed. Second, as there is an habituation of hippocampal response to novelty ( ), a familiarization phase avoids group differences for this effect. How pre-exposure may further affect interpretation will be addressed in the discussion. 

During familiarization, the face stimuli were displayed three times in a randomized order for 2000 ms each with a stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA) of 3000 ms. This procedure was chosen to avoid effects of novelty and floor effects during the later memory task. To ensure continuous attention, subjects had to indicate (via left vs. right button-press) whether they had seen the current face before or not. Stimuli were shown in the center of a white screen, and a black fixation dot was presented throughout the entire task. After familiarization, participants performed 20 separate training trials of the face-word Stroop task. These stimuli were different from those presented in the fMRI task. 


#### Face-word Stroop task 
  
The task comprised face-word stimuli consisting of male and female faces [Glasgow Face Database,  ], overlaid by the words “man” or “woman” (in German language). These words could be either congruent or incongruent with the sex of the face ( A). The paradigm consisted of the 120 faces (60 males and 60 females) previously presented in the familiarization task. Faces were displayed for 1500 ms in the center of a white screen. We used an event-related design in order to identify separate trial-related Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses. Trial onsets randomly varied with a pseudo-exponentially distributed SOA of 5000 ms (75%), 7500 ms (17%) and 10,000 ms (8%). The words were displayed in red ink superimposed on the faces. Both trial types were presented in a randomized order and occurred with a probability of 50%. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two stimulus sets. Stimuli that were congruent in one group of subjects were incongruent in the other group. Subjects had to indicate whether a face was male or female by pressing the left or right mouse button (button assignments were counterbalanced across participants in each group). Throughout the entire paradigm, a black fixation dot was displayed in the middle of the face (and right below the word) to ensure accurate fixation.

#### Incidental memory task 
  
About 30–45 min after the face-word Stroop task, an incidental memory task of to the previously seen faces was conducted outside of the MRI scanner. All 120 faces that had been shown in the face-word Stroop task and 40 novel faces were presented in a random order on a standard laptop computer. The faces were displayed in the center of a white screen for 2000 ms, followed by an inter-trial interval of 2000 ms (SOA = 4000 ms). Subjects were asked to indicate whether they had seen the face before (during the fMRI task or the familiarization) or not by pressing one of four buttons (4: “definitely old”, 3: “probably old”, 2: “probably new”, 1: “definitely new”). We tested whether this rating scale was used differently by MTLE patients and healthy controls to exclude the possibility of strategic differences. In the supplement, Fig. S1 shows the number of responses for each response category, separately for target items and distractor items as well as for controls and MTLE patients. In a multivariate ANOVA, “group” (MTLE patients vs. controls) did not affect the number of responses for the different response categories (Pillai's Trace;   V   = 0.2,   F   (8, 29) = 1.0,   p   = 0.45), arguing against a differential use of the rating scale in both groups. 



### MR image acquisition 
  
MR images were collected using a 3T Achieva Philips MR scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, NL) equipped with a six-channel head coil. During the face-word Stroop task, a total of 294 T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar images (EPI) were acquired (TR = 2500 ms; TE = 35 ms; 36 axial slices; interleaved acquisition in ascending direction; FOV = 230 × 230 mm ; matrix = 64 × 63; slice-thickness = 3.6 mm; no interslice gap; flip angle = 90°). The first 6 vol were discarded. The imaging volumes were tilted upwards by 15° from the AC-PC-plane in order to reduce distortions and signal dropouts in the anterior temporal lobes. 

Additionally, an anatomical 3D T1-weighted (T1w) turbo field echo (TFE) sequence (repetition time [TR] = 7.4 ms; echo time [TE] = 3.4 ms; inversion time [TI] = 900 ms; flip angle = 9°; 176 slices; matrix = 256 × 224; field of view [FOV] = 256 × 224 mm ; slice thickness = 1 mm) was acquired. To investigate changes in medial temporal lobe structures, paracoronal T2-weighted (T2w) images perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampi were acquired using a turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence (TR = 5196 ms; TE = 118 ms; parallel imaging factor [SENSE] = 1.5; turbo factor = 26; 38 slices; FOV = 200 × 200mm ; acquisition matrix = 372 × 312; slice thickness = 2 mm; slice gap = 0.2 mm). 


### Data analysis 
  
#### Behavioral data 
  
Mean response times (RT), including only correct responses, and accuracy of responses in the face-word Stroop task were analyzed with two-way mixed analyses of variances (ANOVAs) with “congruency” (incongruent vs. congruent) as a within-subject factor and “group” (healthy controls vs. MTLE patients) as a between-subjects factor. 

Memory performance was analyzed as follows. First, we sought to replicate the previous finding of conflict-enhanced memory. As in our previous study, we contrasted the number of “definitely old” (remembered) with all other ratings (forgotten) for target stimuli, reflecting a high confident recognition measure (putatively mainly based on recollection). In an additional analysis, we counted previously presented stimuli rated as either “definitely old” or “probably old” as remembered, and faces rated as “probably new” and “definitely new” as forgotten, reflecting a more global measure of both recollection and familiarity. We also assessed false alarm rates (distractor items rates as “definitely old” or “probably old”). In all analyses, two-way mixed ANOVAs were conducted to investigate main effects of congruency and group as well as their interaction. 

We additionally analyzed response times for remembered target stimuli (“definitely old” and “probably old”). These results are presented in the supplement. 

We also tested for correlations between Stroop task performance and retrieval rates using non-parametric Kendall's tau, as this parameter is particularly suitable for small groups analyses. We corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction (p-value/2). The results are presented in the supplement. 


#### FMRI data preprocessing and analysis 
  
The fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12; University College, London, UK) using the same procedure as applied previously ( ). In short, functional EPIs were realigned, normalized, resliced and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with 8 mm FWHM. We verified the accuracy of normalization in patients with the greatest abnormalities in the medial temporal lobe. Correction of normalization parameters was not necessary. 

Based on our a-priori hypothesis that conflict-induced memory improvement is directly mediated by hippocampal recruitment, in the fMRI analysis, we focused on the effects of congruency and the interaction between congruency and memory within a hippocampal ROI. If significant, we further report main effects of memory and group as well as the interaction “congruency x memory x group”. To not miss any effects outside the hippocampus, we also tested for these effects in a whole-brain analysis. 

In follow-up analyses, we extracted beta-values from significant activation clusters and performed within and between group comparisons, respectively. Please note that such post-hoc comparisons are not corrected for multiple comparisons. They are presented for illustrative purposes and they do not allow inferences. 

The first level general linear model (GLM) included four regressors (and their temporal derivates) related to the experimental conditions and six movement regressors derived from the realignment procedure. Due to the overall high memory performance, the experimental conditions (congruent, incongruent) were divided into trials with faces that were recollected with high confidence vs. faces that were not recollected with high confidence. 

Thus, in the fMRI analysis, we contrasted stimuli rated as “definitely old” with all other ratings, corresponding to an fMRI measure that is putatively mainly based on recollection, as in our previous study ( ). In the supplement, we also report fMRI results based on first-level models in which we contrasted remembered (“definitely old” and “probably old”) with forgotten (“probably new” and “definitely new”) items. 

First-level individual contrast images for each of the four experimental conditions were entered into random-effects second-level analyses for the two groups (healthy controls vs. MTLE patients). We applied flexible factorial designs to investigate main effects of “congruency” (incongruent vs. congruent), “memory” (recollected with high confidence vs. not recollected with high confidence) and the interaction (congruency x memory) within each group. Additionally, the contrast images from controls and MTLE patients were entered into a common GLM (flexible factorial design) to test for a main effect of “group” and for interactions of the two within-subject factors “congruency” and “memory” with the between-subjects factor “group” (group x congruency, group x memory). 

Voxel activations were identified at an initial cluster-forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 and family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level (for whole-brain analyses) or at the voxel-level (for hippocampal ROI analyses), respectively. In the hippocampal ROI analysis, we performed small volume correction for a ROI containing left and right hippocampus as defined by the Automatic Anatomic Labeling (AAL) atlas ( ). In this analysis, MTLE patients with amygdalohippocampectomy were excluded. For the interpretation of activations, we subdivided the hippocampus into an anterior ( Y ≥ -21 mm MNI) and a posterior (Y ≤ -22 mm MNI) part ( ). 


#### Functional connectivity analyses 
  
We performed exploratory functional connectivity analyses using the CONN toolbox V18.b ( , RRID:SCR_009550). Functional images were preprocessed using SPM and corrected for noise using the default denoising pipeline ( ). In addition to temporal band-pass filtering (0.008 – 0.09 Hz), the procedure included linear regression of confounding factors, i.e. effects of no interest from white matter, cerebrospinal fluid and movements (realignment parameters). 

The functional connectivity analysis was a seed-based connectivity measure (seed to voxel) based on bivariate correlational analyses during the task (averaging congruent and incongruent trials). We chose two anatomical seed regions, i.e. left and right hippocampus, based on the ROI in the univariate analysis. First-level connectivity maps representing z-transformed correlation coefficients in the BOLD signal between the seed and each voxel in the brain were entered into a second-level ANOVA, allowing us to investigate differences of hippocampal connectivity between MTLE patients and controls. The statistical threshold was identical to that used in the univariate fMRI analysis (i.e.   p   < 0.05; FWE-corrected at the cluster level with an initial cluster-forming voxel threshold of   p   < 0.001). Analysis and results of regional brain volumes are described in the supplement.

## Results 
  
### Behavioral results 
  
#### Face-word Stroop task 
  
The results of the Stroop task are shown in  B,C. 

With respect to RT, a mixed ANOVA revealed significant main effects of “congruency” (incongruent vs. congruent; F(1,36) = 44.3;   p   < 0.001) and “group” (MTLE patients vs controls; F(1,36) = 4.7;   p   = 0.037) as well as a significant interaction (group x congruency; F(1,36) = 4.6;   p   = 0.039). RT slowing in incongruent compared to congruent trials was found in both healthy subjects (t(18) = −5.4;   p   < 0.001) and MTLE patients (t(18) = −3.9;   p   = 0.001), confirming robust interference effects in our paradigm. Comparing patients with left MTLE and patients with right MTLE, a mixed ANOVA did neither reveal a main effect of group (F(1,15) < 0.001;   p   = 1.0) nor an interaction (group x congruency; F(1,15) = 0.01;   p   = 0.9). 

For response accuracy, a mixed ANOVA showed no significant main effects (congruency: F(1,36) = 0.5;   p   = 0.46; group: F(1,36) = 2.5;   p   = 0.12) or interaction (group x congruency; F(1,36) = 0.5;   p   = 0.51). A mixed ANOVA comparing left and right MTLE patients did not yield a significant main effect of group (F(1,15) = 0.4;   p   = 0.6). 

In sum, in both groups, responses were significantly slower in incongruent trials while accuracy was unaffected. The results indicate conflict effects in both controls and MTLE patients, providing the basis for testing whether memory performance is modulated by conflict-related control processes. 


#### Incidental delayed memory task 
  
Retrieval rates are presented in  . Before analysis, we excluded all error trials and misses in the face-word Stroop task. The number of analyzed items did not differ between controls (97%) and MTLE patients (93%; t(36) = 1.79;   p   = 0.082). Notably, false alarm rates (new faces rated as “definitely old” or “probably old”) did not differ between MTLE patients (33%) and controls (34%; t(36) = 0.1;   p   = 0.9).

  Fig. 2   

We first tested whether stimulus congruency (incongruent vs. congruent) influenced the number of high confident recognition responses for target stimuli, i.e., faces rated as “definitely old”. A mixed ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of “group” (healthy controls vs. MTLE patients; F(1,36) = 7.0;   p   = 0.012) and a trend for an interaction (group x congruency; F(1,36) = 3.0;   p   = 0.092) but no significant main effect of conflict (F(1,36) = 0.2;   p   = 0.9). Thus, MTLE patients reached lower high confident recognition scores than healthy controls. This was true for both congruent (t(18) = 2.1;   p   = 0.046) and incongruent trials (t(18) = 3.2;   p   = 0.003). Within groups, high confident recognition scores did not differ between congruent and incongruent trials in either controls (t(18) = −1.3;   p   = 0.21) or MTLE patients (t(18) = 1.2;   p   = 0.25). Retrieval rates did not differ between right and left MTLE patients (main effect of group: F(1,15) = 2.6;   p   = 0.13) and were independent of congruency (interaction: F(1,15) < 0.1;   p   = 0.8). 

In a complementary analysis, stimuli were counted as remembered when rated as either “definitely old” or “probably old” (reflecting a low confidence recognition measure and possibly reflecting familiarity). In a mixed ANOVA of this more global memory measure, MTLE patients reached lower scores (main effect of group;   F  (1,36) = 6.6;   p   = 0.015) and the interaction between “group” and “congruency” was significant (  F  (1,36) = 5.0;   p   = 0.032). This indicates that word congruency modulated memory differently in healthy controls and MTLE patients when considering a more global measure of memory. Specifically, healthy controls showed improved retrieval of faces from incongruent compared to congruent trials in healthy controls (81.6% vs. 77.6%;   t  (18) = −2.5;   p   = 0.021). By contrast, MTLE patients did not show such memory benefit of incongruent stimuli (65% vs. 66%;   t  (18) = −0.7;   p   = 0.5). In incongruent trials, retrieval rates were significantly higher for controls than MTLE patients (  t  (38) = 3.0;   p   = 0.005), while this difference only reached a trend for congruent trials (  t  (30.5) = 2.0;   p   = 0.052). 

In sum, incongruent distractor words in the face-word Stroop task caused typical behavioral costs in terms of RT slowing in both healthy controls and MTLE patients, but familiarity-based recognition scores increased during conflict only in healthy controls. 



### FMRI results 
  
#### Main effect of congruency 
  
 ROI analysis in the hippocampus  : In line with our main hypothesis and previous work ( ;  ), we first analyzed congruency effects in a ROI consisting of bilateral hippocampus. In healthy controls, we found a small but significant activation increase for incongruent vs. congruent trials in both left posterior hippocampus (MNI −30/−24/−16,   Z   = 3.74, p(FWE) = 0.036; cluster size = 1) and right posterior hippocampus (MNI 28/−36/−4,   Z   = 3.72, p(FWE) = 0.038; cluster size = 1). No effect in the reverse direction was observed in the hippocampus. In MTLE patients, the same analysis did not reveal a main effect of congruency in the hippocampus. In a mixed ANOVA with MTLE patients and controls, we did neither find main effects of congruency or group nor an interaction (group x congruency) within the hippocampus ROI. 

 Whole-brain analysis  : In healthy controls, we found several significant clusters of increased activity during incongruent trials (including bilateral insula, bilateral supplementary motor area and cingulate cortex, left precentral gyrus, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, precuneus, caudate nucleus, left putamen;  ,  A). No clusters showed a reverse effect. These clusters largely replicate results of our previous study ( ) and are typical findings in cognitive tasks that require behavioral inhibition ( ).

  Fig. 3   

In MTLE patients, the same analysis did not yield any significant activation clusters. A mixed ANOVA including controls and patients showed a significant group x congruency interaction in the precuneus spreading to the PCC (MNI peak coordinates: −4/−58/38; cluster size = 182;   p  (FWE) = 0.048;  B). This interaction indicates a reduced conflict-induced activation increase in MTLE patients compared to controls. Post-hoc paired t-tests in this interaction cluster showed increased activation during incongruent relative to congruent trials in healthy subjects (  t  (18) = −4.5;   p   < 0.001) but not in MTLE patients (  t  (18) = 1.1;   p   = 0.27;  C). 

In sum, we found conflict-related activations in an extended frontoparietal network in healthy controls and reduced effects in MTLE patients. 


#### Subsequent memory effects 
  
 ROI analysis in the hippocampus  : In healthy controls, we did not observe a significant main effect of memory in bilateral hippocampi in an ANOVA with the within-subject factors “congruency” (congruent vs. incongruent) and “memory” (recollected with high confidence vs. not recollected with high confidence). Interestingly, however, we found a significant congruency x memory interaction with a peak in the left posterior hippocampus (MNI peak coordinates −32/−24/−16;   Z   = 3.81; p(FWE) = 0.028; cluster size = 4;  A), spreading into anterior hippocampus (max/min Y(mm): −20/−24). This cluster, which comprises only voxels surviving voxel-level FWE-correction within the hippocampal ROI, was directly adjacent to the area where we found conflict-related activation increase (MNI peak coordinates: −30/−24/−16).

  Fig. 4   

Post-hoc paired   t  -tests of the extracted beta values revealed a positive subsequent memory effect for congruent trials (  t  (18) = 2.4;   p   = 0.029), but, somewhat surprisingly, the reverse pattern for incongruent trials (  t  (18) = 2.3;   p   = 0.033), with higher activations for later forgotten as compared to remembered incongruent faces ( B). In MTLE patients, neither the main effect of memory nor the interaction (congruency x memory) revealed significant activations within the hippocampal ROI. 

In sum, in controls, hippocampal activation was associated with greater memory benefits for faces from congruent trials compared to faces from incongruent trials. 

 Whole-brain analysis  : We next tested whether other brain regions were predictive of memory success. In healthy controls, the whole-brain analysis did not reveal any activation cluster with either a main effect of memory or an interaction (congruency x memory). 

In MTLE patients, we found an activation cluster comprising the PCC and the precuneus (MNI peak coordinates: 0/−52/22, cluster size = 182,   p  (FWE) = 0.022,  C) that showed a main effect of memory but no interaction with congruency. 

Post-hoc t-tests of the extracted beta values revealed that activation was increased during encoding of later remembered compared to forgotten faces from both congruent (t(18) = 2.9   p   = 0.01) and incongruent trials (t(18) = 3.7   p   = 0.002;  D). 

The results indicate that the PCC/precuneus contributed to later memory success in MTLE patients independent of congruency. 



### Functional connectivity results 
  
We investigated functional connectivity between activations in hippocampal seeds and each voxel in the brain. For the left hippocampal seed, functional connectivity (over tasks) did not differ between groups. However, MTLE patients showed significantly decreased coupling between right hippocampus and right PCC compared to healthy subjects (MNI 12/−44/30; cluster size = 197,   p  (FWE) = 0.004;  ). The analysis did not reveal a significant interaction (group x congruency).

## Discussion 
  
We investigated how hippocampal lesions in MTLE patients affect the impact of conflict resolution on memory encoding at a behavioral level and at the level of BOLD responses. Using a previously established face-word Stroop paradigm and an incidental memory task, we tested whether the conflict-induced memory benefit that we had found in healthy subjects ( ) was reduced in MTLE patients. Moreover, we investigated whether recruitment of the hippocampus or other conflict-related brain regions is necessary for a memory benefit of conflict stimuli. 

While both MTLE patients and healthy controls showed behavioral costs of conflict processing in the Stroop task, only healthy controls exhibited improved memory for incongruent items. Conflict processing was associated with activation of bilateral hippocampus, precuneus and PCC in healthy controls. Conflict-related activation of precuneus and PCC was significantly reduced in MTLE patients compared to controls. Furthermore, activation of precuneus and PCC instead predicted subsequent memory in MTLE patients. Interestingly, in healthy controls, left hippocampal activation was less efficient for memory encoding in case of conflict compared to non-conflict, a seemingly counterintuitive activation pattern. 

In contrast to the auditory Stroop task in our previous studies ( a,  b), in the face-word Stroop task, MTLE patients showed normal response accuracy and increased RT in congruent but not incongruent trials. This discrepancy may be related to the difference between the tasks: Compared to naming the pitch of a tone (as in our previous study), decisions on the sex of a face are more complex and require integrating various kinds of information. As   already stated, this might have attenuated effects of conflict on behavioral measures and also explain why the present results do not perfectly match with our previous findings. 

Previous studies found that the processing of incongruent items improved subsequent memory ( ;  ). Recently,   showed that memory was only enhanced for those incongruent items that were presented after another incongruent trial. These contradictory findings might be explained by different trial orders of congruent and incongruent trials and/or different Stroop trials that were selected for the later memory task. In the present study, the behavioral results in healthy participants indicate a memory benefit for incongruent items, but only when adapting a more global memory measure including high and low confident recognition. Thus, conflict-induced memory benefit seems to depend on task features such as trial composition or which kind of recognition measure is used. 

Importantly, no such memory benefit was found in MTLE patients. More specifically, MTLE patients showed reduced memory particularly for incongruent items. As we found impairments of response conflict resolution during an auditory Stroop task in an MTLE patient cohort largely overlapping with the current sample ( ), one may assume that the decreased memory benefit relates to reduced conflict resolution performance of patients. 

Based on our previous finding of a reduced conflict-related left hippocampus recruitment in MTLE patients ( ), we hypothesized that the hippocampus itself might contribute to improved memory encoding of incongruent items. Indeed, we found a significant interaction between memory and congruency in the left posterior hippocampus in healthy controls. However, hippocampal activation was actually less pronounced for encoding items from incongruent trials compared to congruent trials. This cluster was close to the region showing conflict-related activation in this study as well as in our previous study that used an auditory Stroop paradigm ( ). This suggests that recruiting the hippocampus for the resolution of response conflicts interferes with its role in memory formation. This finding was unexpected since previous fMRI results found posterior hippocampal recruitment during encoding of repeated stimuli ( ). One explanation might be that it reflects a competition for limited resources between two functions that are both hippocampus-dependent. A similar competition for neural resources in prefrontal cortex has previously been suggested as an explanation for lower memory encoding during a demanding secondary task ( ). Furthermore, converging evidence from animal lesion studies and human fMRI recordings suggest that multiple simultaneously activated memory systems interact in a bidirectionally competitive way ( ). For example, disruption of hippocampal function in rodents enhanced striatal instrumental learning ( ;  ). The theory of a hippocampal competition is also in line with human neuroimaging studies showing that the type of representation that is used for memory or spatial navigation (hippocampal or striatal mediated) affects both performance and activation ( ;  ). 

Alternative explanations for the counterintuitive activation pattern in the hippocampus should be taken into account. Considering that participants had performed a familiarization task before the main experiment, it might be plausible that they did not only encode information during the Stroop task but also retrieved the previously presented items, leading to a competition between encoding and retrieval. This notion is supported by evidence suggesting that encoding and retrieval cannot occur at the same time and, again, compete for limited resources ( ;  ). Thus, an increased recruitment of the posterior part of the hippocampus might reflect retrieval success ( ), leading to reduced memory encoding. This interpretation would be in line with the notion that encoding of familiar or repeated stimuli (possibly due to a retrieval component) more strongly relies on posterior hippocampus ( ;  ;  ). Nevertheless, since healthy subjects showed an improved memory for conflict-related stimuli, neural activity in other brain regions must have had an even greater impact on memory encoding. 

We further tested whether activation of other, possibly connected, brain areas could account for the behavioral results. Healthy controls exhibited conflict-related activation clusters in prefrontal and parietal brain regions, largely in line with the results of our previous study ( ). More specifically, activations in the lateral and medial PFC are thought to mediate conflict monitoring and conflict resolution ( ;  ). From a network perspective, controls’ bilateral activation in the anterior insula suggest an involvement of the salience network ( ). This might represent the neural signal which initiates a switch from default mode activity to cognitive control activity ( ). Posterior midline regions, particularly the precuneus, are also involved in cognitive control processes, probably through their role in directing attention ( ;  ). Conflict-related activation in the precuneus and partly the PCC was significantly reduced in MTLE patients. Notably, these functional changes in the recruitment of precuneus/PCC of MTLE patients were not reflected by volumetric changes in these areas (see Supplemental Results, Table S3). The results are largely in line, however, with our functional connectivity results that revealed decreased coupling between the right hippocampal seed and right PCC ( ). This finding is consistent with previous studies showing extratemporal functional changes in MTLE patients, particularly in regions involved in the default mode network (DMN;  ;  ), and, more specifically, a decoupling between hippocampus and other parts of the DMN ( ;  ;  ). 

The reduced effects of congruency mainly in the precuneus and partly the PCC in MTLE patients compared to healthy controls are in line with the behavioral finding that congruency modulated memory performance in controls but not in MTLE patients. However, can functional changes in the precuneus/PCC indeed explain the reduced memory benefit for conflict stimuli in MTLE patients? Precuneus and also PCC have been suggested to be core nodes of the DMN which is active in the absence of a task and associated with internally directed cognition ( ). In contrast, other studies argued against an involvement of the precuneus in the DMN ( ;  ). It is likely that there is a functional differentiation within precuneus and PCC. Whereas the ventral precuneus and ventral PCC (corresponding to Brodmann areas 29/30) shows integration in the DMN, the dorsal precuneus (or Brodmann area 7) and dorsal PCC are more strongly related to brain areas of motor execution and cognitive control ( ;  ,  ). In MTLE patients, functional changes in the precuneus did not show clear restriction to either ventral or dorsal precuneus. Thus, interpretation on the level of functional networks seems equivocal. Instead, there is convincing evidence for a crucial role of the precuneus in episodic memory ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The idea that the role of the precuneus in episodic memory explains the reduced conflict-related memory benefit in MTLE patients is in line with the finding in our previous study that the precuneus was predictive of a conflict-induced memory benefit ( ). Moreover, and most importantly, we found a distinct activation cluster comprising parts of the PCC and the precuneus which predicted retrieval success independent of congruency in MTLE patients. Notably, the precuneus is more strongly related to memory retrieval ( ) which is in line with the idea that subjects did not only encode but also retrieved the faces they had been familiarized before. Functional impairment in the precuneus due to hippocampal damage might reflect (presumably) maladaptive reorganization of memory processes from hippocampus to posterior midline regions which might contribute to episodic memory impairment and deficits in their modulation by cognitive control. This is largely in line with a previous study showing that functional changes in the posterior cingulum were related to memory performance ( ). We speculate that due to changes in precuneus recruitment, memory recall was not modulated by congruency in MTLE patients, leading to similar (additional) encoding efficiency in both trial types. 

From a broader perspective, the present findings are relevant with regard to a related research line on hippocampal involvement during approach-avoidance conflicts (for review, see  ). For instance, it has been shown that behavioral adaptations in an approach-avoidance conflict paradigm, and in particular the avoidance of threats, was associated with larger activity in the anterior hippocampus of healthy participants ( ). Crucially, behavioral adaptation was impaired in TLE patients, and this did not merely reflect general memory impairments (based on neuropsychological assessment). Moreover, in a recent study, patients with a mesial temporal lobe lesion were impaired in approach-avoidance decision-making but showed recollection of threat memory similar to controls ( ). These findings suggest that hippocampal involvement during approach-avoidance conflict tasks is not necessarily related to memory. In how far hippocampal activity during these particular conflicts is directly contributing to long-term memory is, however, a matter of debate. Specifically, a recent behavioral study ( ) did not find memory improvements in an approach-avoidance conflict task. This is not only challenging the above view, but is also inconsistent with our previous ( ) and current findings in the face-word Stroop task. As discussed by  , this behavioral discrepancy might be explained by differences in the task design (i.e., presence vs. absence of incentive valence; associative vs. item memory) and a ceiling effect due to pre-exposure. Moreover, the interpretation of hippocampal involvement in approach-avoidance conflict tasks is complicated by the incentive valence dimension, which is known to modulate memory formation via the hippocampus ( ). Together, the diverse set of results across different studies and domains support the notion that the hippocampus has a role in both (approach-avoidance) conflict processing and conflict-based memory formation, but the exact relationship between these processes seems to depend on the nature of the paradigm. In the light of this discussion, our observation that hippocampal lesions abolish conflict-induced memory improvements might indicate that an active hippocampus during conflict processing indirectly enhances memory encoding by allowing the conflict-related recruitment of other brain regions, such as the precuneus. 

In the present study, we found reduced BOLD signal in several brain regions in MTLE patients. As patients showed altered conflict-modulation of memory, we interpreted changes of the activation pattern as a dysfunctional process. This is in line with the majority of previous studies showing that activation changes represent a pathological process or an inefficient compensatory attempt in TLE ( ). The situation is even more complex because the BOLD signal depends on neurovascular coupling between neural activity and blood oxygenation (and volume), and this coupling may be substantially altered in epilepsy. Specifically, in epilepsy patients, interictal epileptiform discharges can affect the BOLD signal and thus lead to deviations from linearity in neurovascular coupling ( ;  ). In our study, we reduced the impact of this confound by testing the group differences in the relative activations between two conditions (congruent vs. incongruent). Nevertheless, future studies which allow for a direct measurement of neural activity such as intracranial EEG recordings should be conducted with the same paradigm, ideally after running the experiment via fMRI before electrode implantation. 

Our study has several limitations. Our main behavioral outcome measures of the Stroop task were RT and accuracy which we analyzed separately. The results show that RT was clearly modulated by conflict, while accuracy was not affected (ceiling effect), neither in controls nor in patients. This indicates that the present conflict manipulation did not evoke a substantial number of response errors (a reflection of automatic response capture by the irrelevant stimulus), but led to significantly prolonged RTs (a reflection of cognitive control processes to prevent response errors). The low error rate might be related to the fairly simple two-alternative choice (instead of four responses in the regular Stroop task), and the processing of superimposed gender labels might not be as “automatic” as color-word reading in the regular Stroop task. Having said this, integrating the behavioral data into a diffusion decision model, e.g. see  , could be useful to better characterize the neural and cognitive processes of decision making in the face-word Stroop task (and in comparison to the color-word Stroop task), but this is beyond the scope of the current study. Here, we focused on how memory processes were modulated by previous conflict processing. The precise mechanisms underlying the Stroop effect in different paradigms may be addressed in future studies. Moreover, RT and accuracy assess partly different aspects of conflict processing and the data do not suggest that participants have traded speed for accuracy. 

Furthermore, none of the conflict-related activation clusters we found in the whole-brain analysis in healthy controls turned out to be predictive of healthy subjects’ memory performance, neither over both task conditions, nor specifically for faces of incongruent trials. This might be explained by an insufficient study power. Moreover, it might be related to the generally increased retrieval rates in healthy subjects in the present study compared to the previous one ( ). To account for memory deficits in MTLE patients, we extended the learning phase (familiarization), assuming that this may reduce memory encoding demands during the actual Stroop task. Furthermore, the absence of neutral trials (compared to the paradigm in our previous study) possibly reduced the saliency of the conflict condition. Thus, we suspect that changes in the paradigm that were necessary for investigating MTLE patients reduced the effects of congruency on memory and the corresponding BOLD contrasts of healthy subjects. Related to this, the behavioral congruency effect was particularly evident for the true remembered vs. forgotten comparison. However, which type of memory (i.e. hippocampus-dependent episodic details or hippocampus-independent schematic information) is particularly modulated by conflict, cannot be answered by the current study. This might be an interesting step towards a better understanding of conflict-modulation of memory processes. Furthermore, in contrast to the behavioral contrast, the fMRI recollection contrast (high confident vs. not high confident recollection) revealed more reliable effects due to balanced item numbers. Thus, the relation between behavioral and fMRI results is limited. 

Another limitation is that patients with unilateral left and right MTLE as well as bilateral MTLE were involved in the study, so that we cannot infer whether the fMRI results are modulated by epilepsy lateralization. We did not further analyze fMRI results of subgroups due to their small sample sizes. The delay between learning and retrieval task was not identical between subjects but was between 30 and 45 min. However, the delay randomly varied in all participants and it is unlikely that a systematic error affected group differences. 


## Conclusion 
  
Our study provides first evidence that the memory benefit of conflicting information is absent in MTLE patients and thus seems to critically rely on the integrity of the hippocampus. In healthy participants, the two functions of memory formation and response conflict resolution competed for resources in the hippocampus. In addition, posterior midline areas such as precuneus and PCC supported conflict resolution. In MTLE patients, these posterior midline areas showed reduced conflict-related activation but were recruited for memory formation instead. These results would be in line with a large-scale reorganization of memory networks in epilepsy patients. These alterations may be related to memory impairments and/or deficits in the employment of memories for cognitive control functions. However, further studies in hippocampus-lesioned patients are needed to test the association between episodic memory networks and cognitive control mechanisms.

# Abstract
  Highlights  
  
Social/non-social information processing in three modalities was investigated in SZ. 
  
SZ showed reduced activation for social information only in gesture modality. 
  
Reduced activation in SZ was observed for non-social information only in speech. 
  
Neural Neural processing in bimodal condition is not different between patients and controls. 
  
  
Schizophrenia is characterized by marked communication dysfunctions encompassing potential impairments in the processing of social-abstract and non-social-concrete information, especially in everyday situations where multiple modalities are present in the form of speech and gesture. To date, the neurobiological basis of these deficits remains elusive. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, 17 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and 18 matched controls watched videos of an actor speaking, gesturing (unimodal), and both speaking and gesturing (bimodal) about social or non-social events in a naturalistic way. Participants were asked to judge whether each video contains person-related (social) or object-related (non-social) information. When processing social-abstract content, patients showed reduced activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) only in the gesture but not in the speech condition. For non-social-concrete content, remarkably, reduced neural activation for patients in the left postcentral gyrus and the right insula was observed only in the speech condition. Moreover, in the bimodal conditions, patients displayed improved task performance and comparable activation to controls in both social and non-social content. To conclude, patients with schizophrenia displayed modality-specific aberrant neural processing of social and non-social information, which is not present for the bimodal conditions. This finding provides novel insights into dysfunctional multimodal communication in schizophrenia, and may have potential therapeutic implications.

## Introduction 
  
In everyday social communication, humans encounter a diverse spectrum of inputs from multiple modalities ( ), which might be potentially difficult to process for patients with schizophrenia. These include non-linguistic stimuli from others’ facial expressions ( ,  ), body movements, e.g., postures and gestures ( ,  ,  ), and linguistic stimuli in the form of auditory speech and written texts ( ). Importantly, the multimodal inputs comprise both social-abstract and non-social-concrete information, and patients’ social functioning heavily depends on the processing of these stimuli, which serves as the basis to further mentalize social intentions and to perform appropriate social interaction ( ). To date, however, it remains elusive if the processing of these social/non-social information in schizophrenia is impaired in schizophrenia in a multimodal context. 

Social cognition is known to be impaired in schizophrenia ( ). Regarding the perception of social stimuli, in particular, prior research on patients’ social perception dysfunction has focused on emotional perception of faces and voices ( ,  ), whereas limited studies have investigated the perception of social-abstract information delivered via linguistic and gesture stimuli. In healthy participants, a seminal fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) study has identified distinct brain regions for processing socially and non-socially relevant linguistic information ( ): When participants were asked to judge whether visual word pairs are person– or object-related, person-related social stimuli activated the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a crucial region forming the mentalizing network ( ,  ,  ,  ). On the other hand, when processing linguistic stimuli about non-social-concrete content (e.g., words and sentences about objects), healthy participants activate regions including a left-lateralized network including the left the bilateral insula and the left parietal lobe ( ,  ). 

Notably, in everyday life, both types of information are also commonly conveyed via non-linguistic channels such as manual gestures. For instance, even without speech, individuals can use a “be silent” emblematic gesture to deliver social information, which is commonly intransitive and symbolic; on the other hand, for describing concrete actions, transitive and object-related hand actions, i.e., pantomimes such as “hammering” are commonly used. Moreover, it is common to use both gesture and speech together: To ask someone else to stop, one can use a “stop” gesture (e.g., a front-facing, raised hand) together with its verbal counterpart. Emerging basic research has investigated if the processing of social-abstract and non-social-concrete information is modality-independent: for healthy populations, social-abstract information delivered by both auditory speech and manual gesture commonly activates the mPFC and the (IFG) and middle temporal gyri ( ,  )—regions that are typically activated for social cognition and abstract semantics ( ,  ). For processing non-social action and object information, literature also suggests that humans recruit modality-independent regions, such as the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) and the pre/postcentral gyri ( ,  ,  ). 

The multimodal characteristics of social/non-social information processing, as well as its supramodal neural basis, may have profound implications in schizophrenia research. Schizophrenia is characterized by well-known deficits in the comprehension and production of speech ( ,  ,  ,  ), as well as impairments in the perception and production of gesture ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Clinically, these two aspects may directly contribute to major symptoms of schizophrenia such as formal thought disorder and apraxia/catatonia respectively. They are also indicative of a range of other negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia ( ,  ), and are functionally highly relevant ( ,  ). Yet, regarding the processing of social/non-social information, it remains unknown if both processes are impaired in schizophrenia irrespective of modality, or if the impairments are modality-specific. For the processing of social-abstract information, both linguistic (visual and auditory) and gesture (social emblems) have not been investigated in schizophrenia so far. However, studies employing non-semantic hand actions have shown that patients might be impaired for gesture perception in general ( ,  ). For the processing of concrete and non-social information, a previous study shows that patients are impaired in visually presented sentences ( ). Moreover, given potential dysfunctional processing of social or non-social information in schizophrenia, it remains unclear if these deficits could be potentially compensated by multimodal inputs containing both speech and gesture: Emerging literature suggests mutual facilitation between speech and gesture, at least for healthy populations ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). 

To address these remaining research questions, we conducted the current study, presenting to patients with schizophrenia and matched controls with videos of an actor communicating in a spontaneous and naturalistic manner. In these videos, the actor performs either social-abstract (person-related) or non-social (object-related) content in different modalities, where social and non-social information is perceivable in gesture- and speech-only modalities. Similar to approaches from previous research ( ,  ), we directly compared social vs. non-social videos to identify neural perception of social and non-social information in both auditory-speech and visual-gesture modalities. Additionally, we showed to participants videos with bimodal inputs (actor both speaking and gesturing). Based on previous research, we hypothesized activation of the mPFC and a left frontal-temporal network (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus) for the processing of social-abstract information ( ). For non-social-concrete information processing, we hypothesized left-lateralized regions including the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC), the superior temporal gyrus/sulcus (STG/STS), as well as pre/postcentral gyri forming the putative mirror neuron system ( ,  ,  ,  ). We focused directly on group differences between a group of patients suffering from schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and their age- and education-matched controls: for social content, as patients are well-known for their social cognition impairments, we expected patients to show reduced activation in the mPFC, irrespective of encoding modality ( ); For non-social content, despite mixed findings from previous neuroimaging research on hand action observation on schizophrenia ( ,  ), following previous report on dysfunctional processing of non-social linguistic stimuli in schizophrenia ( ), we hypothesized neural modulation of the object-related regions for patients with schizophrenia for both gesture and speech modalities. Additionally, based on prior basic research on mutual facilitation between gesture and speech ( ; see   for review), we hypothesized that the bimodal input could compensate for potential unimodal processing deficits, leading to improved performance in the patient group. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
We summarized participants’ demographic and clinical characteristics in  . Healthy controls were recruited matching age, gender, and education to patients. Seventeen patients were recruited at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Philipps University of Marburg, and were diagnosed according to ICD-10 with schizophrenia (F20.0, n = 13, and F20.3, n = 1) or schizoaffective disorder (F25.0, n = 2, and F25.2, n = 1). Participants in both groups are native speakers of German, and have no knowledge of Russian language. All except one of the patients received antipsychotic treatment; six were additionally treated with antidepressive medication (For detailed medication at the time scanning, see  ). Positive and negative symptoms were assessed with the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) ( ), and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) ( ). Eighteen age–, gender–, and education-matched healthy participants with no history of any mental disorders were recruited from the same area. Exclusion criteria for both groups were brain injury and neurological or other medical diseases affected by brain physiology. In both groups, we conducted neuropsychological tests to assess working memory function, digit span, trail making (TMT), verbal IQ (MWT-B) ( ), and metaphoric language processing (concretism, evaluated with the Proverb Interpretation Task) ( ). These measures are reported in  . We report, additionally, scores from word fluency test, as well as gesture production and perception (BAG, Brief Assessment of Gesture ( )) in the supplement ( ). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing. Except for one control and one patient, all other participants are right-handed ( ). All participants gave written informed consent prior to participation in the experiment and were compensated monetarily. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the School of Medicine, Philipps University Marburg.

### Materials and procedure 
  
We employed a content judgement paradigm from previous studies from our research group to investigate modality-specific processing of social/non-social information ( ,  ,  ), which has elicited dissociable but supramodal neural processing of social-abstract and non-social-concrete information in a healthy student sample ( ). Of note, the same fMRI dataset has been published with an unrelated research question ( ). We showed to participants five-second videos of an actor spontaneously communicating both social-abstract (S) and non-social-concrete (N) events in the following modalities: 1) incomprehensible Russian sentences with gestures. This is considered as a gesture-only (G) condition because social feature is only available to participants in the gesture form. 2) comprehensible German sentences (S) without any gestures. Additionally, we also showed to participants 3) German sentences with accompanying gestures as a bimodal input condition (B). A filler condition is also included with videos of incomprehensible Russian sentences with meaningless gestures. An example of both a social (S) and non-social (N) bimodal videos is illustrated in  A. For a complete list of all videos, please refer to Appendix in  .

The same stimuli were also presented in two additional modalities: gestures with foreign Russian sentences (G) and German sentences without any gestures (S). For illustrative purposes, the spoken German sentences were translated into English, and all spoken sentences were written into speech bubbles. Panel B: Illustration of a sample trial. Participants performed a content judgment task for each video, indicating via button press whether a stimulus was either person– or object-related. 
  


### Procedure 
  
Altogether, 312 experimental video slips (26 videos per condition × 6 conditions × 2 sets) were included in the study. For each participant, an experimental session comprised 182 videos from one set of videos (156 critical videos and 26 filler videos), and consisted of two 14-minute runs. Each run contained 91 trials with a matched number of items from each condition. The stimuli were presented in an event-related design in pseudo-randomized order. Within each trial, each video-clip was followed by a gray background with a variable duration of 2154–5846 ms (jitter average: 4000 ms), as illustrated in  B. Participants performed a content judgement task for each video ( ,  ), indicating via button press (with their left hand) whether a stimulus was either person– or object-related. Participants were instructed to respond to the task as soon as they had decided on an answer. 


### fMRI acquisition and preprocessing 
  
All images were acquired using a 3 T MRI scanner (Siemens MRT Trio series). The functional images were obtained using a T2*-weighted echo-planar image sequence (TR = 2 s, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, slice thickness = 4 mm, interslice gap = 0.36 mm, field of view = 230 mm, matrix = 64 × 64, voxel size = 3.6 × 3.6 × 4.0 mm, 30 axial slices orientated parallel to the AC-PC line, ascending order). Two runs of 425 volumes each were acquired during the experiment. Additionally, simultaneous EEG data from the participants were also collected for other analyses not relevant for the current study, and are therefore not further discussed here. MR images were preprocessed using the SPM12 software package (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Welcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK) based on Matlab R2017a (version 9.2.0; MathWorks): after discarding the first five volumes to minimize T1-saturation effects, all images were spatially and temporally realigned, and normalized into the MNI space using the MNI template (resulting voxel size 2 × 2 × 2 mm), smoothed (8 mm isotropic Gaussian filter), and high-pass filtered (cut-off period 128 s). 


### fMRI data analysis 
  
We performed statistical whole-brain analysis in a two-level, mixed-effects procedure. On the first level, single-participant BOLD responses were modeled by a design matrix comprising the onset time points of each event (critical word of each sentence as used in the previous event-related fMRI and EEG studies, e.g., ( ,  ,  ,  ,  )), with a duration of 5 s for all experimental conditions. The micro-time onset was set to the average time bin (8 of 16) to align the onset vector to the slice in the middle of the brain. For all conditions, the duration of speech and gesture was used as parameters of no interests on a single trial level. Six movement regressors (three rotations and three translations) were entered in the single participant’s model to account for movement-induced effects on fMRI results. HRF was defined as the canonical HRF. Contrasts images against implicit baseline for all experimental conditions were used as summary measures and were included in the between-group analysis. We applied a flexible factorial analysis of variance using condition as main effect. We applied a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the cluster extent threshold to correct for multiple comparisons, ( ,  ), which has been used in comparable studies in our laboratory on social perception of multimodal stimuli ( ). For all statistical comparisons, the whole-brain activation was simulated assuming a voxel type-I error activation of p < .05, this revealed a cluster extent of 2268 contiguous resampled voxels as sufficient to correct for multiple comparisons at p < .0167 (Bonferroni-corrected for three independent tests for interaction within three independent modalities, with 0.05/3). We also reported in activation tables uncorrected cluster p-values and marked significance for cluster-level FWE correction. The reported voxel coordinates of activation peaks are located in MNI space. For the anatomical localization, functional data were referenced to the AAL toolbox ( ). 

Firstly, we tested three-way interaction of group × modality × content. We then conducted, within each modality, interaction analyses to investigate group differences in the processing of social or non-social conditions, and masked the respective results based the contrast image from the first analysis, to reveal modality-specific group interaction. In addition, within each modality, for each group, we conducted pair-wise comparison between social and non-social conditions (S > N and N > S), for illustrating modality– and group-specific brain activations for either social or non-social information processing. In the end, following our hypotheses on bimodal enhancement for patients, within patients, we tested the interaction between modalities on social vs. non-social content processing, so as to reveal how bimodal stimuli might compensate potential neural processing deficits for patients with schizophrenia. Results of this analysis is reported in  . 

Based on the literature showing a potential relationship between symptom severity (especially negative symptoms) and social/non-social cognition ( ,  ), as well as gesture processing ( ,  ), for patients with schizophrenia, we conducted exploratory correlation analysis, probing for the potential relationship between clinical measures and brain activation in areas that are relevant to social/non-social information processing. To this end, spearman correlation analyses (uncorrected) were conducted between 1) parameter estimates from clusters showing significant group difference for either social or non-social conditions, 2) behavioral measures (reaction times and accuracy) for each experimental condition, and 3) scores from sum/general and subscales of SAPS and SANS. 



## Results 
  
### Behavioral results 
  
Healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia were instructed to indicate via button press whether the actor in the video described a person-related content or an object-related content. Correct responses (percentage correct) and their reaction times were analyzed each with mixed ANOVA [within factors: CONTENT (social vs. non-social) and MODALITY (bimodal vs. gesture vs. speech); between factor: GROUP (control vs. patient)]. Descriptive statistics for each experimental condition for both groups were provided in  .   
Accuracy and reaction times (RT) for the behavioral task. 
    

For accuracy, we observed three main effects despite, but no interaction with GROUP (F  = 0.83, p = 0.44, η G = 0.003): Patients were significantly less accurate than healthy controls (F  = 5.18, p = .03, η G = 0.05). Non-social videos were judged more accurately than social videos (F  = 19.75, p = .0001, η G = 0.18). Additionally, accuracy between the three modalities was different (F  = 14.53, p = .00001, η G = 0.04). Post-hoc pairwise   t  -test showed that the accuracy for the bimodal conditions were highest (vs. gesture, t = 5.81, p = .000001; vs. speech, t = 2.77, p = .007). The accuracy for the speech conditions was also higher than the gesture conditions (t = 2.14, p = .035). 

For reaction times, there were also three main effects, but no interaction with GROUP (F  = 0.75, p = 0.47, η G = 0.003). Patients were generally slower than healthy controls (F  = 19.64, p = .00001, η G = 0.35). Reaction times for non-social content were faster than social content (F  = 8.63, p = .005, η G = 0.005). Additionally, reaction times for the three modalities were different (F  = 10.14, p = .0001, η G = 0.01). Post-hoc pairwise   t  -test showed that the reaction time for gesture modality was significantly slower than the other modalities (|t|  = 4.03, p  = 0.0001), and there was no significant difference between the bimodal and the speech modalities (t = 0.21, p = .82). 

The results from the behavioral task showed that patients with schizophrenia were generally slower and less accurate in the content judgement task. Additionally, the responses for non-social videos were faster and more accurate. With regard to modality, responses in the bimodal conditions were the most accurate and the fastest. However, it has to be noted that, due to the limited sample size (see Discussion), we refrain from elaborating on the interpretation of the observed behavioral effects. 


### fMRI results 
  
#### Social-abstract (S) > Non-social-concrete (N) 
  
We report whole-brain fMRI results for S > N comparisons in   and  . For the speech conditions (SS > NS), healthy controls activated an extensive fronto-temporal-parietal network including the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the temporal lobe, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and mPFC, and the left supramarginal gyrus; patients revealed similar regions for this comparison, and we observed no group difference for social > non-social speech. For the gesture conditions (SG > NG), controls activated the bilateral PFC and IFG; patients activated the bilateral prefrontal cortex. Group interaction (Control (SG > NG) > Patient (SG > NG)) suggests that patients showed reduced activation in the mPFC and the anterior cingulate cortex for the social gesture condition when compared to controls ( B). In the bimodal condition (SB > NB), both controls and patients activated regions similar to that of the speech condition. For patients, we additionally reported modality*content interaction in the  , which shows that patients’ aberrant processing of social gestures is improved in the bimodal modality.

Panel B: interaction analysis (Control > Patient) in the gesture modality (SG > NG) together with box- and swarm-plots of eigenvariates for selected clusters.

#### Non-social-concrete (N) > Social-abstract (S) 
  
We report whole-brain fMRI results for N > S comparisons in   and  . For the speech conditions (NS > SS), healthy controls activated the left pre/postcentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and the left insula, whereas patients did not reveal any significant activations for this comparison. The group interaction (Control (NS > SS) > Patient (NS > SS)) suggests that, when compared to controls, patients showed reduced activation in the left postcentral gyrus and the right insula for the processing of non-social content in the speech-only modality (see  B). For gesture conditions (NG > SG), controls showed increased activation for the non-social content in the bilateral posterior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and occipital cortices, as well as the left pre/postcentral gyrus and the left insula. Patients also activated the bilateral posterior temporal gyrus and occipital lobe, as well as the left pre/postcentral gyrus. The group interaction revealed no significant clusters. For bimodal conditions (NB > SB), both controls and patients activated regions that are comparable to that of the gesture conditions. Additionally, for patients, bimodal input seems to enhance their aberrant processing of non-social speech, as reported in  .

### Exploratory correlation analyses 
  
In patients, for the NS condition, we found that the accuracy for the NS condition correlate negatively with the SANS composite scores of the patients (r = -0.52, p = 0.03, power = 0.63;  A). Additionally, SANS 1 (flat affect) and SANS 2 (alogia) scores correlate negatively with the accuracy for the NS condition (SANS 1: r = -0.62, p = 0.008, power = 0.79,  B; SANS 2: r = -0.63, p = 0.006, power = 0.82,  C).

## Discussion 
  
With an fMRI study on the perception of social-abstract and non-social-concrete stimuli in auditory-speech, visuo-gestural, and bimodal modalities, we observed modality-specific neural modulation in schizophrenia: In comparison to controls, reduced neural activity in patients was observed only for social gesture and non-social speech. Moreover, in the bimodal condition, neural activation for both social and non-social contents was comparable in patients and controls. 

### Social information processing in schizophrenia 
  
In the current study, patients showed dissociable neural modulation during the processing of social content in speech and gesture modalities. In the speech modality, both controls and patients activated a left-lateralized set of brain regions, including the dlPFC, mPFC, the IFG, the temporal lobe, and the angular/supramarginal gyrus, without any group difference. This finding replicates results from our previous study showing supramodal social-abstract processing of healthy individuals ( ), and is consistent with earlier studies in basic research on the role of the mPFC in both perceiving social-related stimuli and mentalizing social intentions ( ,  ,  ). The observed left IFG and temporal lobe activation is also in line with the literature on the neural substrates of abstract vs. concrete semantics ( ,  ), as the videos in the social-abstract condition, irrespective of modality, are more abstract than the non-social, object-related condition. The fact that we did not find any group differences in social-abstract speech processing suggests that patients with schizophrenia exhibit intact neural processing of social content presented in this modality. This finding complies with a previous language study in schizophrenia, in which patients also activated a comparable left fronto-temporal network to controls when they processed abstract vs. concrete visual sentences ( ). Together, although schizophrenia is well-known for its social cognition deficits ( ), as well as impairments in the perception of affective face or pitch ( ,  ,  ), patient’s processing of social speech may remain intact. In the gesture modality, however, although patients activated the mPFC for the social vs. non-social stimuli, this activation was reduced when compared to controls. Notably, such modality-specific neural modulation is, for the first time, reported for social information processing in schizophrenia. Notably, in addition to the mPFC modulation, in schizophrenia, we did not observe the activation for social gestures in the left IFG. The left IFG has been linked to motor planning of gesture ( ); and, together with the DLPFC, left IFG activation has been shown to be modulated in schizophrenia for social gesture planning ( ). In addition to the left IFG, the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) activation was not observed for patients with schizophrenia when processing social gestures. Importantly, functional and structural aberrance in both the left IFG and MTG are highly indicative of major language deficits (e.g., formal thought disorders) in schizophrenia ( ,  ). Here, however, rather than showing a modality (speech) -specific neural modulation, our results indicate that these regions indicate a cross-modality deficit, and echo prior research on potential neural aberrance in these regions regarding integration between speech and gesture at both lower-perceptual and higher-semantic levels ( ,  ). To summarize, our results, from a processing perspective, corroborate these extant studies, showing that functional modulation in the PFC, and potentially in the left IFG and MTG, may give rise to gesture-specific social perception deficits. 


### Non-social information processing in schizophrenia 
  
For the processing of non-social (object-related) information, again, the neural modulation in patients showed an apparent dissociation. In the gesture modality, both controls and patients activated the bilateral occipital-parietal cortices, STG, LOTC, insula, and the pre/postcentral gyrus. In the speech modality, although these regions were similarly activated in controls, their brain activation was significantly reduced for patients. The group comparison suggests reduced activation in schizophrenia patients in the bilateral insula and the left postcentral gyrus for non-social speech. Of note, the observed regions for non-social and object-related information processing overlap with regions considered as part of the putative mirror neuron network, which is not only important for action observation and imitation, but also for the understanding of object- and motor-related features in verbal form ( ,  ,  ,  ). This process would require mental simulation of sensorimotor experience ( ,  ,  ). Additionally, the LOTC is also crucially involved in the perception of biological motion, object, face, as well as tool-use ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Moreover, these regions are also reported to support the processing of concrete linguistic information ( ,  ). Our data from the control group suggest that these regions support the processing of non-social-concrete features, irrespective of encoding modality. This finding is in line with the embodiment view of action and language processing ( ,  ). With regard to the patients, we observed normal neural processing of non-social content in the gesture modality, supporting a previous study ( ), which reported intact mirror neuron activity in schizophrenia (but see ( )). However, as we also observed reduced bilateral postcentral gyrus and right insula activity for patients for non-social speech, in turn, this would imply that motor simulation, as required for processing object-related features from auditory speech, might still be impaired in schizophrenia ( ,  ). This impairment concurs with the reported deficits of schizophrenia in action imitation ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), where certain degrees of motor simulation is required. However, adding to prior research on schizophrenia’s motor impairments, our results provide a more nuanced version: Motor-related semantics as delivered by pantomime does not necessarily lead to reduced neural activation in schizophrenia; rather, modulated neural activity is only observed for speech contents simulating these concrete motor-actions. Additionally, schizophrenia is commonly related to structural changes in the left insula; this region is also functionally relevant to a range of language and speech processing aberrances in schizophrenia ( ,  ,  ). Therefore, functional abnormality in this region might also contribute to the simulation of motor events with speech. In sum, our fMRI results may suggest that patients with schizophrenia are impaired in a mirror-mechanism simulating concrete-motor events with speech. 

In the NS condition, we also observed negative correlation between patients’ SANS composite and subscores and their task accuracy. This evidence converges with previous research, corroborating the potential role of the mirror neuron system during embodiment of non-social information (e.g., action imitation and observation), as well as its relation to the development and persistence of negative symptoms ( ,  ). Our correlational finding, although being exploratory (see 4.4), links the mirror neuron system to the reported studies showing correlation between compromised gesture performance and more severe negative symptoms ( ,  ), tentatively suggests that the theoretical link between gesture and negative symptom may partially derive from motor-simulation. Notably, in the current study, for social processing, we did no observe any correlations between brain activations / behavior and symptom measures, especially positive symptoms such as hallucinations, and positive formal thought disorders, as in  . Clearly, the exact relationship between social/non-social information processing and major symptoms of schizophrenia needs to be addressed by further research with larger samples. 


### Enhancing modality-specific information processing deficits with bimodal input 
  
The novelty of our findings lies in the dissociable modality-specificity concerning dysfunctional neural processing of social and non-social features. Social-abstract and non-social-concrete features are functionally and neurally dissociable at the representational level ( ,  ,  ). Besides, they might be differentially processed through either linguistic (speech) or non-linguistic (gesture) channels. It has been proposed that social-abstract concepts may be   preferentially   represented in speech, and that non-social concrete concepts are   preferentially   delivered in hand action and gesture ( ,  ). Despite this theoretical proposal, however, during comprehension, healthy participants are able to process both types of information in a supramodal manner (e.g., semantic processing with unitary core systems, irrespective of encoding modality, as in ( ,  )). For patients with schizophrenia, as they exhibit similar neural activations when processing social speech and non-social gestures to controls, this might be an indication that they are at least intact in processing these contents through a   preferred   modality at representational level. But, they might show activation reduction in relevant regions when these features are conveyed in a   non-preferred   modality, as the processing of these features would require some form of mental simulation: In the case non-social information, patients are impaired in the simulation of motor-related experience from action to language ( ); In contrast, when patients are presented with social information, they might be impaired when simulating social features encoded by hand gestures (but not with speech), as shown in their reduced mPFC activation. This observed modality-specific processing deficit might also suggest that patients, unlike controls, are not capable of processing social/non-social information in a supramodal manner like healthy participants, as reported in previous studies ( ,  ). More importantly, extending previous studies on aberrant processing of social/non-social content in schizophrenia, our results indicate that this neural deficit is not universally present for either a specific modality or content, but rather appears only in specific combinations of these two factors. 

Despite reduced neural processing of both social and non-social content in gesture and speech modalities, patients displayed intact neural processing of these features, as well as improved task accuracy in the bimodal conditions. This enhancement effect concurs with a line of proposals ( ), who argue for a bi-directional facilitative relation between speech and gesture (for empirical evidence, see ( ,  ,  ,  ,  )). More importantly, our finding extends previous basic research, suggesting the translational implication of this mechanism. In schizophrenia research, the past decade has witnessed substantial progress in the development of social cognitive training in schizophrenia ( ,  ), with recent innovation regarding the incorporation of social stimuli from a broader range of modalities ( ). Our findings extend these approaches, proposing potential therapeutic implications of deploying naturalistic and multimodal stimuli during social cognitive training ( ), as they might be able to normalize processing of both social and non-social information, at least at a neural level. Future research is expected to further explore whether the neural enhancements can be linked to functional outcome after social cognitive training in a multimodal setting. 


### Limitations 
  
Despite new insights, our study has limitations in several aspects. Firstly, the sample size of this study (n = 17 and 18 for each group) falls within the required minimum of this type of studies ( ). Hence, the patient group was limited to medicated chronic patients, and we were thus unable to test if the neural pattern is comparable to first-episode schizophrenia ( ), and were unable to attribute the findings to schizophrenia without separating out the effects of medication. Secondly, due to the limited sample size and the exploratory nature, the findings resulted from the correlation analyses needs to be treated with caution. Thirdly, our the reported group interaction did not survive the most conservative FWE threshold. Future replications are thus necessary to validate if the observed effects are replicatable when a larger sample is possible. Lastly, we did not observe any reliable relationship between BOLD signal and behavioral results: More careful, and neurobiologically plausible behavioral tasks on the social/non-social information processing are necessary for future experiments, so that their processing deficits in schizophrenia can be better examined by clinical neuroscientists and practitioners. 


### Conclusion 
  
Here, in an fMRI study, we for the first time showed modality-specific neural modulation in schizophrenia when patients process social-abstract and non-social-concrete content in speech and gesture. Moreover, these deficits could be compensated when both speech and gesture were presented together. Our findings provide novel insights on dysfunctional multimodal communication in schizophrenia, and suggest potential therapeutic implications of employing multimodal social cognitive intervention in schizophrenia.

# Abstract
 
## Background 
  
Men and women show differences in sensitivity to reward and punishment, which may impact behavior in health and disease. However, the neural bases of these sex differences remain under-investigated. Here, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a variant of the Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MIDT), we examined sex differences in the neural responses to wins and losses and how individual reward and punishment sensitivity modulates these regional activities. 


## Methods 
  
Thirty-sex men and 27 women participated in the fMRI study. We assessed sensitivity to punishment (SP) and sensitivity to reward (SR) with the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ). In the MIDT, participants pressed a button to collect reward ($1, 1¢, or nil), with the reaction time window titrated across trials so participants achieved a success rate of approximately 67%. We processed the Imaging data with published routines and evaluated the results with a corrected threshold. 


## Results 
  
Women showed higher SP score than men and men showed higher SR score than women. Men relative to women showed higher response to the receipt of dollar or cent reward in bilateral orbitofrontal and visual cortex. Men as compared to women also showed higher response to dollar loss in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex. Further, in whole-brain regressions, women relative to men demonstrated more significant modulation by SP in the neural responses to wins and larger wins, and the sex differences were confirmed by slope tests. 


## Conclusions 
  
Together, men showed higher SR and neural sensitivity to both wins, large or small, and losses than women. Individual differences in SP were associated with diminished neural responses to wins and larger wins in women only. These findings highlight how men and women may differ in reward-related brain activations in the MIDT and add to the imaging literature of sex differences in cognitive and affective functions.

## Background 
  
### Reward processing in health and illness 
  
Reward-directed behavior is fundamental to survival and well-being [ ]. We strive to obtain primary (food, water, sex) and secondary (money, social approval) rewards [ ,  ]. Reward-seeking behavior engages neural circuits central to motivation and learning [ ,  ]. Numerous studies have identified the ventral tegmental area, ventral striatum (VS), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and anterior cingulate cortex as key regions for reward processing [ – ]. These structures integrate motivational and cognitive processes to support reward-seeking behavior [ ,  ,  ]. Further, individuals vary in how they respond to reward-related contingencies [ ], and men appear to be more sensitive to reward whereas women are more sensitive to punishment [ ,  ]. 

Many neuropsychiatric conditions implicate motivation deficits and reward processing dysfunction. For instance, anhedonia and compulsive drug seeking represent core symptoms of major depression and substance use disorders (SUDs), respectively, and implicate dysfunction of the reward circuitry [ ,  ]. Studies have consistently found reduced striatal response to reward anticipation and feedback [ ] and impaired learning of reward contingencies [ ] in patients with depression. The neural deficits correlate positively with anhedonia and negatively with treatment outcome [ ,  ,  ]. Chronic pain is frequently comorbid with depression and associated with deficits in reward responses [ ]. Substance misuse alters the salience of natural reinforcers and compromises self-control of immediate gratification, perpetuating drug seeking [ ,  – ]. Adolescents exposed prenatally to maternal cigarette smoking are observed to have a weaker bilateral VS response to reward anticipation [ ]. Importantly, many of these neuropsychiatric conditions demonstrate sex differences in their clinical profiles and etiological processes, with, for instance, women more vulnerable to depression and men to SUDs. Thus, it is important to better understand how men and women process reward differently. 


### Sex differences in reward and punishment processing 
  
Biological, including hormonal, and socio-cultural factors may all account for sex differences in reward sensitivity and reward-directed behavior [ ,  ]. Indeed, the literature is mixed regarding sex differences in reward-related behavior and the neural processes underlying such differences. For example, some studies showed that women relative to men were better at delaying gratification [ ,  ], but others showed no sex differences [ ]. A study in rodents reported no sex difference in reward-guided associative learning across multiple paradigms. However, females appeared to be faster in learning to avoid punishment and, after learning, exhibited higher sensitivity than males to probabilistic punishment but less sensitive when punishment could be avoided with certainty [ ]. Women compared to men tended to pick decks with lower frequency of punishment on a gambling task [ ]. In a study combining electroencephalography (EEG) and a guessing task with both reward and punishment feedback, boys showed lower feedback-related negativity (FRN) and less behavioral changes following punishment [ ]. Further, girls but not boys demonstrated FRN to punishment in correlation with a reward sensitivity trait. In another EEG study of an incentive delay task, boys relative to girls showed less stimulus-preceding negativity in anticipation of punishment and greater feedback P3 to monetary than social reward [ ]. These findings are consistent with a literature of higher female sensitivity to loss, punishment or other negative feedback [ ,  ,  ]. 

In contrast, visual sexual stimuli activated the reward system in both sexes whereas the VS was involved in men but not women in supporting the distractor effects of the stimuli on line orientation judgment [ ]. Adolescent boys relative to girls showed greater VS activation during reward processing in a risky decision making task, made a higher percentage of risky selections, and self-reported greater motivation to earn money than girls [ ]. Studying the perceived value of monetary vs. social rewards using a monetary/social incentive delay task, another group reported activation of a wider mesolimbic network in response to anticipation of monetary reward in men and in anticipation of both monetary and social reward in women, in accord with their reaction time performance [ ]. In a recent work of a reward go/no-go task, men exhibited greater arousal in response to “go” action (predominating monetary wins), and the arousal better predicted go success rate, as compared to women [ ]. On the other hand, women were better than men in learning from positive (but not negative) feedback in a probabilistic selection task [ ]. In another study of the Human Connectome Project data, women relative to men showed more suppression of the default mode circuit and higher activation of the dorsal attention circuit during exposure to both reward and punishment, suggesting enhanced saliency of both reward and punishment in women [ ]. Thus, sex differences in reward-related processing appear to depend on the nature of rewarding stimuli and behavioral contingency. 


### The effects of reward and punishment sensitivity on reward-related processing 
  
In addition to sex, individuals may also vary in reward-related behavioral and neural processes because of distinct reward and punishment sensitivity. Sensitivity to reward scores correlated positively with reactivity to erotic pictures in the left OFC, left insula, and right VS [ ]. In a study of reinforcement learning, individual differences in reward sensitivity were positively associated with bilateral VS activation during receipt of reward, while differences in punishment sensitivity were negatively associated with left dorsal striatal activity during loss anticipation and with right lateral OFC activation during loss feedback [ ]. Another study examined three groups of people, each with low, medium, and high reward sensitivity, in a working memory task with sub- and supra-liminal stimuli. Individuals with medium reward sensitivity improved performance with high reward in both subliminal and supraliminal conditions, whereas the effect of reward was stronger in the supraliminal than subliminal condition for those with high reward sensitivity scores [ ]. The latter findings highlighted complex effects of individual reward sensitivity on cognitive performance incentivized by monetary reward. Investigators have also associated sensitivity to punishment with higher insula activity during feedback of social loss in a social incentive delay task in people with subthreshold depression [ ]. On the other hand, despite its wide use in the imaging literature, no studies of the monetary incentive delay task (MIDT) have examined how neural responses to monetary wins or losses may vary with individual sensitivity to reward or to punishment. 



## Methods 
  
### Aim, design and setting of the study 
  
The present study aims to characterize sex differences in cerebral responses to reward anticipation and feedback and whether women and men differ in the influences of individual reward and punishment sensitivity on these neural processes. On the basis of the literature, we broadly hypothesized higher SR in men relative to women and reward circuit responses in correlation with SR in both men and women. We would also explore how SP modulated neural response to wins and losses and potential sex differences in SP modulation. To these ends we contrasted men and women in regional responses to reward anticipation and feedback in neurotypical populations. We performed linear regression to identify how these regional responses may vary according to individual SR and SP and examined the sex differences in these correlations with slope tests. Understanding sex differences in reward processing would provide information for translational studies to examine sex-specific neural markers of clinical conditions that implicate reward processing dysfunction. 


### Subjects and assessments 
  
Sixty-three healthy adults (27 women; 22–55 or 37 ± 11, mean ± SD, years of age) participated in this study. All subjects were healthy with no current use of prescription medications. None reported a history of head injury or neurological illness. Other exclusion criteria included current or past Axis I Disorders including dependence on a psychoactive substance, according to DSM-IV. All participants were evaluated with the Sensitivity to Reward and Sensitivity to Punishment Questionnaire (SPSRQ) [ ]. The SPSRQ contains 48 yes–no items, half concerning the scale for behavioral impulsivity/responsiveness to reward and half concerning the scale for behavioral avoidance in response to potentially adverse consequences. Scores were obtained by totaling the number of yes-answers in each scale, with a higher sub-score each indicating higher sensitivity to reward (SR) and sensitivity to punishment (SP). Table   summarizes subject characteristics.

### Monetary incentive delay task (MIDT) 
  
In the MIDT (Fig.  a), a bet (a dollar, a cent, or no money, randomly intermixed) appeared on the screen at the beginning of each trial. After a randomized fore-period between 1 and 5 s (uniform distribution), a target box was shown for a short period (response window, see below). Subjects were told to press a button as quickly as possible to collect the money (win) before the target box disappeared. An accurate trial was defined by a button press before disappearance of the target box. Otherwise, subjects would lose the bet, with the amount deducted from the total win. A premature button press prior to the appearance of the target box terminated the trial, and similarly resulted in loss. Feedback was shown on the screen after each trial to indicate the amount of money won or lost. Approximately 42% of all trials were dollar trials, 42% were cent trials, and “no money” constituted the remaining trials. The inter-trial-interval was 1.5 s. The response window started at 300 ms, and was stair-cased for each trial type (dollar/cent/no money) separately; for instance, if the subject succeeded at two successive dollar trials, the window decreased by 30 ms, making it more difficult to win again; conversely, if a subject failed for two successive trials, the response window increased by 30 ms, making it easier to win. We anticipated that the subjects would win in approximately 67% each for dollar and cent trials. Each subject completed two 10-min runs of the task. Across subjects, there were 184 ± 4 (mean ± SD) trials in a study.

### Imaging protocol, data preprocessing, and modeling 
  
Brain images were collected using multiband imaging with a 3-T MR scanner (Siemens Trio, Erlangen, Germany). Conventional T1-weighted spin echo sagittal anatomical images were acquired for slice localization. Anatomical 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) image were next obtained with spin echo imaging in the axial plane parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC–PC) line with repetition time (TR) = 1900 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.52 ms, bandwidth = 170 Hz/pixel, field of view = 250 × 250 mm, matrix = 256 × 256, 176 slices with slice thickness = 1 mm and no gap. Functional, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were then acquired with a single-shot gradient echo echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence. Fifty-one axial slices parallel to the AC–PC line covering the whole brain were acquired with TR = 1000 ms, TE = 30 ms, bandwidth = 2290 Hz/pixel, flip angle = 62°, field of view = 210 × 210 mm, matrix = 84 × 84, 51 slices with slice thickness = 2.5 mm and no gap, multiband acceleration factor = 3. 

Data were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8). Individual subjects’ images were corrected for motion and slice timing. A mean functional image volume was constructed for individual subjects per run from the realigned image volumes, co-registered with the high-resolution structural image, and segmented for normalization with affine registration followed by nonlinear transformation [ ,  ]. The normalization parameters determined for the structure volume were applied to the corresponding functional volumes for individual subjects. The images were then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm at Full Width at Half Maximum. 

We examined event-related BOLD signals in a general linear model, where we distinguished the cue onset of dollar, cent, and “no money” or nil trials, and the feedback onset of dollar win, dollar loss, cent win, cent loss, and nil. A statistical analytical design was constructed for each individual subject, with the onsets of individual trials convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and with the temporal derivatives of the canonical HRF and entered as regressors in the model [ ]. Realignment parameters in all six dimensions were also entered in the model. Serial autocorrelation caused by aliased cardiovascular and respiratory effects was corrected by a first-degree autoregressive model. The GLM estimated the component of variance explained by each of the regressors. 

In group level or random effects analyses, we employed one-sample t tests to examine whole-brain responses to individual contrasts (see below) in men and women combined and two-sample t tests to examine sex differences in these contrasts with age and RT differences, as specified by the contrasts, as covariates. To investigate the neural correlates of SR and SP, we conducted whole-brain linear regressions of these contrasts on SR and SP, with age and RT differences, as specified by the contrasts, as covariates for men and women combined as well as separately. For sex-specific findings, we defined the functional clusters identified from linear regressions in men and women alone as regions of interest, extracted the β estimates for all subjects, and performed slope tests to examine sex differences in the correlations [ ]. Note that the slope test for sex difference does not represent “double-dipping” or circular analysis, as the slope tests may confirm or refute sex differences [ ,  ]. 

All models were evaluated with a threshold combining voxel p < 0.001, uncorrected and cluster p < 0.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected, following current reporting standards. Voxels with peak activity were indicated with Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates. We have also deposited the unthresholded maps of all contrasts on Neurovalut ( ). 



## Results 
  
### Behavioral performance 
  
Figure  b, c show the accuracy rate (AR) and reaction time (RT) of dollar, cent, and nil trials. For both men and women, the ARs were close to 67%, suggesting the success of the staircase procedure. For men, the AR ranged from 40 to 71% for dollar, 41 to 71% for cent, and 41 to 70% for nil trials. For women, the AR ranged from 55 to 71% for dollar, 43 to 69% for cent and 49 to 69% for nil trials. There were no significant sex differences in the AR of dollar (t  = − 0.76; p = 0.45), cent (t  =  − 0.37; p = 0.70), or nil (t  =  − 0.73; p = 0.47) trials or in the RT of dollar (t  = 0.05; p = 0.96), cent (t  =  − 0.04; p = 0.97), or nil (t  = 0.04; p = 0.97) trials. 

Men showed higher sensitivity to reward (SR) score than women, and, in contrast, women showed higher sensitivity to punishment (SP) score than men (Table  ). We examined the relationship between behavioral performance and SR and SP for men and women together and separately. In linear regressions, SR score was positively correlated with the AR of dollar trials in men + women (r  = 0.28, p = 0.02) and in women (r  = 0.52, p = 0.006). SR score was also positively correlated with the AR of cent trials in men + women (r  = 0.33, p = 0.008) and in women (r  = 0.51, p = 0.007). SR score was negatively correlated with the RT of cent trials in women (r  =  − 0.44, p = 0.02), SP score was positively correlated with the RT of dollar trials in women (r  = 0.50, p = 0.007), and SP was positively correlated with the RT of cent trials in men + women (r  = 0.28, p = 0.03) (Fig.  ). The r and p values of all correlations are shown in Table  . However, although women appeared to show more significant correlations between SR/SP scores and performance measures, relative to men, the slope tests did not reveal significant sex differences in any of these correlations (all p’s ≥ 0.47).

### Sex differences in regional responses to reward anticipation (“bet”) 
  
In a one-sample t test, we evaluated regional activations to anticipation to win dollar vs. nil, cent vs. nil and dollar vs. cent in men and women combined (Fig.  ). Anticipation of a dollar reward involved activation of the medial visual cortical areas, including the cuneus, dorsal striatum, supplementary motor areas, thalamus, and cerebellum. In contrast, anticipation of a cent reward involved “deactivation” of a large swath of medial and lateral visual cortical areas, bilateral inferior frontal cortex, and cerebellum. In a covariance analysis with age and RT differences as covariates, men and women did not show significant differences in activation to reward anticipation during dollar vs. nil, cent vs. nil, or dollar vs. cent trials.

### Sex differences in regional activations to feedback (win or loss) 
  
In a one-sample t-test, we evaluated regional activations to dollar win vs. nil, cent win vs. nil, dollar vs. cent win, dollar loss vs. nil, cent loss vs. nil, and dollar vs. cent loss in men and women combined. These results are shown in Fig.  . Both dollar and cent wins engaged higher activation of the ventral striatum (VS) and visual cortical areas. Dollar wins engaged additional brain regions, including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, caudate nucleus and the cerebellum. In contrast, both dollar and cent losses engaged higher activation of bilateral anterior insula and medial frontal cortex, including the anterior cingulate gyrus, and left somatomotor cortex.   
Regional activations to outcomes: a dollar win vs. nil; b cent win vs. nil; c dollar vs. cent win; d dollar loss vs. nil; e cent loss vs. nil; and f dollar vs. cent loss. Clusters showing greater response to dollar > nil and nil > dollar, etc., are shown in warm and cool colors, respectively. Color bars indicate voxel T value. Voxel p < 0.001, uncorrected. Neurological orientation: right is right 
  

In covariance analyses to compare men and women with age and RT differences as covariates for each of these contrasts, we observed sex differences in activation (men > women) in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and occipital cortex for dollar win > nil (Fig.  a), and in the left frontal/temporal Rolandic operculum for cent win > nil (Fig.  b). Compared to women, men also showed higher activation to dollar loss > nil in similar areas of the bilateral OFC and to cent loss > nil in the right precentral gyrus. Clusters meeting cluster p < 0.05 FWE are summarized in Table  . None of the other contrasts, including dollar win vs. dollar loss and cent win vs. cent loss (not shown in the figure), showed significant sex differences.

### Whole brain regression with SP and SR scores 
  
We examined how regional responses to anticipation of dollar vs. nil, cent vs. nil, and dollar vs. cent varied with individual differences in SR and SP. None of the regressions revealed significant findings in men and women combined or alone. 

Likewise, we examined how regional responses to feedbacks varied with individual differences in SR and SP. For each of the six contrasts, we performed a linear regression with both SR and SP scores as regressors and years of age and RT difference, as specified by the contrast, as covariates for men and women combined as well as separately. In men alone, the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/PCu) showed activation to dollar win vs. nil in positive correlation with SR score. In women alone, right middle frontal and postcentral gyri showed activation to dollar win vs. nil in negative correlation with SP score. Women also showed activation to dollar vs. cent win in the right anterior insula, left superior frontal gyrus and right temporal gyrus in negative correlation with SP score. These clusters are shown in Fig.  . Some of these regional activities were also observed in men and women combined. These clusters are summarized in Table  .

The statistics are summarized in the main text. a β contrast “dollar win vs. nil” of the PCC/PCu was positively correlated with SR score in men but not in women; however, the slope test failed to confirm the sex difference (z = 1.88, p = 0.06). b The β contrast “dollar win vs. nil” of the right middle frontal and postcentral gyri was negatively correlated with the SP score in women but not in men, and the slope test confirmed the sex difference in the correlation (z = 3.33, p = 0.0009). c The β contrast “dollar vs. cent win” of the right anterior insula and temporal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the SP score in women but not in men, and the slope test confirmed the sex difference (z = 4.46, p < 0.0001)

To examine sex differences, we performed slope tests [ ] on the six individual clusters with regional activities in correlation with the SR or SP score in men or women alone. The results for the individual clusters identified from the same contrast were statistically identical and thus these clusters were combined in slope tests. The results showed that the β contrast “dollar win vs. nil” of the PCC/PCu was positively correlated with SR score in men (r  = 0.665, p = 1.81e-05) but not in women (r  = 0.277, p = 0.180); however, the slope test failed to confirm the sex difference (z = 1.88, p = 0.06). The β contrast “dollar win vs. nil” of the right middle frontal and postcentral gyri was negatively correlated with the SP score in women (r  =  − 0.751, p = 1.53e−05) but not in men (r  =   − 0.080, p = 0.653), and the slope test confirmed the sex difference in the correlation (z = 3.33, p = 0.0009). The β contrast “dollar vs. cent win” of the right anterior insula and temporal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the SP score in women (r  =   − 0.847, p = 9.24e−08) but not in men (r  =   − 0.024, p = 0.894), and the slope test confirmed the sex difference (z = 4.46, p < 0.0001). The regressions for men and women together and separately are shown in Fig.  . 



## Discussion 
  
We studied sex differences in reward processing in a sample of 63 healthy adults (27 women) using a variant monetary incentive delay task (MIDT). The volunteers made a timed response to win “the bet” of $1, ¢1, or nil. We examined how sex influenced behavioral performance and neural activation to monetary reward anticipation and feedback. Our results show that while there are no sex differences during reward anticipation, male sex is associated with higher activity to feedback of winning $1 (vs. nil) in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and visual cortex, as well as higher activity of losing $1 (vs. nil) in largely the same region of bilateral OFC. Men relative to women also showed higher activation in the left frontal/temporal Rolandic operculum during ¢1 wins vs. nil. These results suggest that men have heightened neural sensitivity to receiving monetary reward of higher or lower magnitude than females and that both wins and losses of large reward were more salient for men, relative to women. As quantified by the SPSRQ, men showed higher sensitivity to reward (SR) and women showed higher sensitivity to punishment, in keeping with the literature [ ,  ,  ]. Further, women showed more significant modulation by individual SP in the neural responses to wins and larger wins. We highlight the main findings in the discussion below. 

### Lack of sex differences in response to reward anticipation 
  
Our results showed that there were no significant sex differences in neural activation to reward anticipation. Reward anticipation is central to associative learning, and this finding is broadly consistent with animal behavioral studies reporting no sex differences in reward guided associative learning in male and female rodents [ ]. In human imaging literature, both men and women have been found to activate a wide neural network to anticipation of monetary reward [ ]. Similarly enhanced activation in the VS, ventral tegmental area, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex was observed in both sexes in anticipation of smiling faces of the opposite sex [ ]. No sex differences were found in activation of the reward circuits during anticipation of sexually explicit materials [ – ]. However, one study showed increased activation in men vs. women of the ventral putamen during reward anticipation in a gambling task. This same study found that women’s reward circuit was more reactive to anticipation of uncertain reward during the mid-follicular, when estrogen levels are high, than luteal menstrual phase [ ]. Thus, our findings need to be interpreted with caution because of a limited sample size and lack of control of menstrual phase in female participants. It is also likely that sex differences or the lack thereof in regional responses to reward anticipation may depend on the behavioral contingencies; i.e., whether the motor decision involves learning or simply guessing or a speedy response to acquire the reward. 


### Sex differences in response to feedback and reward/punishment sensitivity 
  
Behaviorally, while men and women each showed higher SR and SP score, in accord with earlier reports using the SPSRQ [ ,  ], SP and SR score appeared to influence task performance in both sexes. However, men and women differed in regional responses to reward. Relative to women, men engaged bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and visual cortex to a greater extent in response to dollar win vs. nil and the same regions in bilateral OFC in response to dollar loss vs. nil. Men relative to women also showed higher activity in the left frontal/temporal Rolandic operculum to cent win vs. nil. The OFC is involved in learning and optimal decision-making [ ], encoding motivational salience of stimuli to support approach behavior [ ,  ], and integrating stimulus attributes and emotional value [ – ]. As part of the association cortex, the frontal/temporal Rolandic operculum is implicated in thought, planning and learning of reward contingencies [ – ]. Thus, these findings suggest greater male sensitivity to monetary reward, in accord with the literature. For instance, an event-related potential study in adolescents reported higher feedback P3 amplitude in boys, as compared to girls, in response to monetary rewards [ ]. Another study reported a preferential response of the OFC to attractive vs. unattractive faces in men but not in women [ ]. 

Women showed regional responses to wins and larger wins in negative correlation with SP. These areas include the right middle frontal gyrus and anterior insula, each part of the ventral attention and salience networks [ ,  ]. In contrast, these regional responses were not correlated with SP scores in men and the responses of these same regions to losses did not correlate significantly with SP scores in women. Thus, higher neural sensitivity to wins appears to be a marker of individual variation in SP in women. Conversely, although falling short of statistical significance (p = 0.06), men seem to demonstrate higher neural sensitivities to wins in relation to SR scores. Thus, reward-related neural responses and behavior may be modulated by distinct personality traits across the two sexes. 

In our previous study of the MIDT task, activation of the right caudate head, along with the SMA and right anterior insula during reward anticipation, was correlated with diminished differences in RT collecting a large vs. small reward, suggesting its role in reward-based cognitive motor control [ ]. Although one would expect individual SR or SP may be reflected in behavioral performance, we did not observe a significant correlation between the trait and any performance measures in men and women combined or examined separately. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to revisit this issue. 


### Limitations and additional considerations 
  
A number of limitations need to be considered for the study. First, we did not record the menstrual phase of women, which may have introduced variance to influence the current findings. Second, we did not study sex-based variation in general incentive salience. Men relative to women are more motivated by monetary reward; however, the current findings cannot be generalized to other (e.g., social) rewards or behavioral contingencies. Third, the sample size is relatively small to address sex differences. Thus, these findings should be considered preliminary. Finally, the current MIDT variant did not explicitly distinguish sessions where participants were expected to win vs. to lose. Thus, although it is reasonable that participants would expect to win in general (~ 67%) and anticipation did involve regional activities typically implicated in the MIDT, we had no way to evaluate the trial-by-trial variation in the extent participants expected to win or to lose. It is perhaps also for this reason that we did not observe sex differences in anticipation-related activities or an impact of SR and SP traits on these activities. Again, these “negative” results would need to be revaluated with a larger sample and paradigms that instruct anticipation to win vs. lose. 

A few additional issues are worth considering. We did not observe a similar pattern of responses (but of different magnitude) to anticipation of dollar and cent wins. In fact, the occipital cortex showed diametric responses between anticipation of dollar and cent wins, suggesting an effect of relativity—large and small reward may not engage the same circuit in a linear fashion. Further, women appear to be more loss aversive than men [ ], and it remains to be seen to what extent loss aversion can be captured by punishment sensitivity and how sex differences in loss aversion may account for the current findings. More studies with multiple behavioral paradigms [ ] are warranted to investigate these issues. 


### Perspectives and significance 
  
Men and women differ in trait and neural sensitivity to reward and punishment. The literature nearly consistently finds men to be more sensitive than women to monetary reward. These heightened neural responses to monetary feedback involve the cognitive motor circuits, including the SMA and caudate nucleus, and would likely influence a wide range of reward-related behavior. The sex differences in reward and punishment sensitivity may have a greater impact on neural activation to reward processing and reward-related decision making than we were able to demonstrate with the data collected of the MIDT. It remains to be seen whether or how these behavioral and neural sensitivity manifest in other laboratory paradigms and real-life decision making. Further, it is unclear how genetic and sociocultural factors may contribute to the sex differences. Sex differences in the incidence and phenomenology of neuropsychiatric and behavioral disturbances such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse are known to be directly related to reward saliency processing and reward-based learning. It would be of significant interest to public health whether a gender-free or gender-less upbringing, now an emerging trend in child rearing, may alter the picture of sex differences in reward processing and in the susceptibility to neuropsychiatric illness that we find in our society today. 



## Conclusions 
  
We replicated higher male sensitivity to reward and female sensitivity to punishment as evaluated by the SPSRQ. Although these individual differences did not translate to influence behavioral performance in the MIDT, likely due to a small sample size, men and women exhibited differences in neural responses to reward. Men show higher SR and neural sensitivity to the receipt of reward, big or small, and to loss, as compared to women. Women showed higher SP than men and individual differences in SP are reflected in regional brain responses to wins and larger wins in women but not in men. These findings add to the imaging literature of sex and individual differences in reward processing.

Sensory acquisition functions of the cerebellum in verbal working memory

# Keywords

# Abstract
 
Several fMRI studies have shown that the superior cerebellum exhibits load-dependent activations during encoding of letters in a Sternberg verbal working memory (VWM) task. It has been hypothesized that the cerebellum regulates the acquisition of sensory data across all modalities, and thus, that VWM load activations may reflect high- vs low-load differences in sensory acquisition demands. Therefore, increased difficulty in sensory data acquisition should elicit greater activation in the cerebellum. The present fMRI study manipulated sensory acquisition in VWM by presenting visually degraded and non-degraded stimuli with high and low memory loads, thereby identifying load-dependent regions of interest in the cerebellum, and then testing if these regions showed greater activation for degraded stimuli. Results yielded partial support for the sensory acquisition hypothesis in a load-dependent region of the vermis, which showed significantly greater activation for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli. Because eye movements did not differ for these stimulus types, and degradation-related activations were present after co-varying eye movements, this activation appears to be related to perceptual rather than oculomotor demands. In contrast to the vermis, load-sensitive regions of the cerebellar hemispheres did not show increased activation for degraded stimuli. These findings point to an overall function of association-based prediction that may underlie general cerebellar function, with perceptual prediction of stimuli from partial representations occurring in the vermis, and articulatory prediction occurring in the hemispheres. 
 

# Body
 
## Introduction 
  
A growing body of evidence is demonstrating that the cerebellum is not only involved in motor coordination and motor learning, but also in non-motor functions, such as linguistic processes (for a review see Mariën and Borgatti  ), affective processing and emotional regulation (e.g., Lupo et al.  ; Jeremy Schmahmann  ; Schmahmann and Sherman  ), executive functions (Bellebaum and Daum  ; Bürk et al.  ), working memory (e.g., Desmond et al.  ; Hayter et al.  ; Peterburs et al.  ; Ravizza et al.  ), and timing (Breska and Ivry  ; Coull et al.  ; Ivry  ). It has been suggested that the cerebellum may sub-serve overarching functions irrespective of the domain, by involvement in more general processes of performance monitoring (Peterburs and Desmond  ), prediction and the generation of internal models (Ito  ; Wolpert et al.  ), sequence detection in the context of both cognitive and motor behavior (e.g., Leggio et al.  ; Molinari et al.  ), and automatization (Balsters and Ramnani  ; Ramnani  ). Indeed, given that the cerebellum is characterized by a rather uniform neuroarchitecture, and given the existence of closed cerebro-cerebellar input–output loops (Middleton and Strick  ; Strick et al.  ), the idea of uniform cerebellar computations and overarching functions is very enticing. However, this idea has recently been challenged by the proposal of multiple functionality, i.e., the idea that the same underlying circuits may implement functionally distinct computations that may also differ across domains (Diedrichsen et al.  ). Of course, this idea is not necessarily incompatible with the notion of overarching cerebellar functions, because the specific role of the cerebellar circuits could potentially change during brain development, and it is also possible that a universal cerebellar transform cannot be adequately captured in the proposed functional terms (Diedrichsen et al.  ). In any case, the debate about universal and multiple functionality illustrates that the question of how the cerebellum contributes particularly to non-motor functions warrants further investigation. 

One of the most extensively studied non-motor functions of the cerebellum is verbal working memory, i.e., the ability to temporary store and manipulate verbal information. According to Baddeley’s multi-component model (Baddeley  ), working memory comprises a “central executive” that serves as a supervisory module controlling the flow of information to the subordinate phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad which serve to temporarily rehearse and manipulate verbal and visual information, respectively. The model was later amended with an episodic buffer that links information across domains and with long-term and semantic memory (Baddeley  ). Previous neuroimaging studies on the role of the cerebellum for verbal working memory have revealed that specific cerebellar subregions are differentially involved in encoding and maintenance/rehearsal. Activation in a superior region localized in lobule VI and Crus I during stimulus encoding that occurs in concert with activation in posterior frontal cortex has been linked to articulatory control (Chein and Fiez  ; Chen and Desmond  ,  ), while activation in an inferior region in lobules VIII and VIIB has been associated with phonological storage (Chen and Desmond  ; Desmond et al.  ). 

Importantly, neuroimaging investigations of cerebellar engagement in verbal working memory have allowed scientists to empirically test different hypotheses about the precise role of the cerebellum. For instance, a study that combined eye tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Peterburs et al.  ) clarified that cerebellar activations during encoding in a verbal working memory task cannot be attributed to oculomotor behavior, as had been proposed based on fronto-cerebellar connectivity patterns (Doron et al.  ). Moreover, recent findings suggest that the cerebellum may contribute to phonological storage by predictive processes: maintenance-related inferior cerebellar activations were shown to be sensitive to repeating stimulus sequences (Peterburs et al.  ). Another theory of overarching cerebellar function states that the cerebellum is involved in perceptual processes (a comprehensive overview of converging evidence for this notion is provided in a consensus paper, Baumann et al.  ) and particularly in sensory acquisition, i.e., the extraction and primary processing of sensory information from the environment. Specifically, it has been proposed that the cerebellum ameliorates the efficiency with which other brain regions perform their respective functions by monitoring and adjusting sensory data acquisition (Bower  ). This notion is supported by cerebellar activation in response to cutaneous stimulation in the absence of motor output, increased cerebellar activation when there is tactile discrimination demand, and by even more pronounced cerebellar activation when tactile discrimination is combined with motor activity (Parsons et al.  ). 

The question arises if the cerebellum is also involved in sensory acquisition outside of the tactile domain. A previous meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies on auditory processing revealed that specific cerebellar regions, here most notably left lateral Crus I, were activated consistently in a range of auditory tasks (Petacchi et al.  ), which supports a general auditory function of the cerebellum that likely relates to sensory acquisition. Findings of impaired pitch discrimination in patients with cerebellar degeneration and a strong relationship between clinical ataxia scores (reflecting the extent of the cerebellar damage) and pitch discrimination deficits also corroborate this notion (Parsons et al.  ). Moreover, activation in left Crus I was shown to scale with perceptual demands in a task that required discrimination of both visual and auditory motion signals from noise, indicating that this region may be a supramodal sensory processing region (Baumann and Mattingley  ). 

If the cerebellum is indeed involved in sensory acquisition, taxing (visual) sensory acquisition demand in a verbal working memory task should modulate the associated cerebellar activations. More specifically, load-dependent cerebellar activations during stimulus encoding in a verbal working memory task should be sensitive to a manipulation of stimulus quality. The present study tested this hypothesis using degraded and non-degraded letter stimuli in a variant of the Sternberg task (Sternberg  ). Cognitive load-dependent regions of interest (ROIs) in the cerebellum were identified and tested for greater activation for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli. In keeping with the notion that load-dependent cerebellar activations may reflect high- vs low-load differences in sensory acquisition demand, we hypothesized that increased difficulty in sensory data acquisition should elicit greater activations. 


## Materials and methods 
  
The present study was part of a larger investigation of cerebellar contributions to verbal working memory and presents follow-up analyses of data reported in a previous study (Peterburs et al.  ). Importantly, this earlier study investigated whether cerebellar activation during encoding could be related to eye movements and oculomotor processing, while the present work was specifically focused on elucidating sensory acquisition functions of the cerebellum. To this end, the present study presents novel analyses of the previously unanalyzed factor stimulus quality (see task description below for details). 

### Subjects 
  
Fifteen healthy adult volunteers (10 women, 5 men) were recruited from the Baltimore community by public advertisement and on social media. Mean age was 31.6 ± 9.4 years, ages ranged 22–54 years. All subjects were native English speakers, right-handed according to self-report, and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Exclusion criteria included a history of neurological or psychiatric illness or head trauma, current medication affecting the central nervous system, and the following criteria pertaining to MRI scanning: claustrophobia, implanted electric or ferromagnetic devices, and pregnancy. Mean educational attainment was 18.2 ± 2 years (range: 15–21). All subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation and received monetary compensation for participation and travel expenses. The study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. 


### Sternberg verbal working memory task 
  
The experimental task was a variant of the Sternberg task (Sternberg  ). In each trial, subjects had to keep a briefly presented set of consonants in memory by rehearsal until a probe letter was presented, and to then indicate by button press whether this probe matched one of letters in the initially presented set. The Sternberg task can be divided into discrete phases of stimulus encoding, maintenance, and retrieval which differ in terms of sensory and motor demands. The present variant of the task used normal and degraded stimulus quality (see Fig.  ) to tax sensory acquisition demand (please see below for behavioral findings from a supplementary study that confirmed increased sensory acquisition demand for the present degraded compared to the non-degraded stimuli). To tax oculomotor demand, stimulus spacing was varied in two levels (close or wide). Luminance was equated for all stimuli. To manipulate cognitive and articulatory load, two and four letter consonant sets were used. As shown in Fig.  , percent sign (%) placeholders were displayed in unused positions in the consonant sets with only two letters. As mentioned in the previous study (Peterburs et al.  ), the task also included overt and covert rehearsal instructions at the beginning of each trial. However, since sensory acquisition was expected to only affect the encoding phase, trials were pooled across rehearsal conditions for the present analyses. In addition, trials were also pooled across stimulus spacing conditions.   
Schematic illustration of the sequence and time course of stimulus presentation in a trial of the Sternberg verbal working memory task 
  

Figure   illustrates the sequence and time course of stimulus presentation in one trial of the Sternberg task. Each trial started with a fixation cross that was presented for 3–5 s (which implemented jitter in trial onsets for fMRI analysis), followed by a set of two or four consonants that was presented for 2 s (encoding phase). A blank screen was presented in the maintenance phase for 4 or 6 s, while subjects were rehearsing the consonants. Last, the probe was presented for 3 s, and subjects decided whether it was a “match” or “no match” by pressing one of two response buttons with their right index or middle finger. Task instructions emphasized both speed and accuracy, and accordingly, response time (RT) and accuracy were recorded for each trial. Subjects completed 10 practice trials outside the scanner prior to starting the experiment. The task consisted of three runs with 64 trials each, amounting to 192 trials in total. Stimulus quality (degraded or normal), spacing (wide or close), and cognitive load (high or low) were balanced in each run. Trial order within each run was pseudorandomized so that presentation of identical parameters was limited to three consecutive trials. Each run contained 24 unique match and 24 unique no-match trials as well as 16 trials without a probe. The latter were included to allow the hemodynamic response to fully return to baseline following the maintenance phase. In these trials, a blank screen was presented in the retrieval phase, and no response was expected. For trials with probe, positions of the target letter in the initial sequences were counterbalanced. Task completion took approximately 55 min and included short breaks between runs. 

Stimulus presentation was controlled with E-Prime 2 software (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Sharpsburg, PA, USA) running on a Hewlett Packard xw4300 workstation. The visual display was rear-projected onto a screen in the MRI scanner located behind the participant and then reflected onto a mirror fixed to the head coil within the participant’s immediate line of view. Responses were recorded using two Velcro-connected fiber optic button boxes (MRA, Inc., Washington, PA). 


### Behavioral test of increased sensory acquisition demand by degraded stimuli 
  
To directly test whether degraded stimuli were producing increases in sensory processing, a behavioral pilot experiment was conducted with a sample of 16 healthy adult volunteers. Subjects completed a target detection task in each trial of which they received a lowercase target letter, followed immediately by one of the four types of visual stimuli that had been presented during the fMRI verbal working memory task described above. The subject's task was to simply indicate as rapidly as possible whether or not the uppercase version of the target letter appeared among the four items of the consonant set. The increase in reaction time (RT) needed to make this decision for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli was used to assess the increase in sensory acquisition demand. Two stimulus lists were created such that the letters that were degraded in list 1 were non-degraded in list 2 and vice versa. Half of the subjects (  n   = 8) received list 1 and the other half received list 2. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the within-subject factors load (2 letters or 4 letters) and stimulus quality (degraded or non-degraded) revealed only a significant main effect of stimulus quality [F[1, 15]  = 60.269,   p   < 0.001], with mean RT values of 799 ± 39 ms for degraded stimuli and 716 ± 33 ms for non-degraded stimuli. These results support the notion that visual degradation significantly increased sensory processing. 


### Recording of eye movements during the task 
  
Eye movements were recorded during scanning with an Arrington Research (Scottsdale, AZ, USA) MR-compatible infrared eye tracker and the ViewPoint  user interface at a sampling rate of 60 Hz. The camera was fixed to the scanner cot just outside the head coil with a flexible mount and pointed towards the left eye. Gaze point coordinates were recorded as relative position on the screen, [0, 0] reflecting the upper left and the lower right corner. Prior to the first task run, a nine-point auto-calibration procedure as implemented in ViewPoint  software was applied. Here, calibration points were presented at nine equidistant locations in the stimulus display in randomized order, and subjects were instructed to foveate on each point. After all points had been presented, the recorded locations were superimposed on a 3 × 3 grid and visually checked for calibration quality. Calibration accuracy was determined based on the grid’s geometry: a rectilinear configuration indicated successful calibration. If the grid was distorted, single calibration points were re-presented to improve calibration. 

Eye movement data were analyzed off-line using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). First, data were segmented according to the onset of encoding phase of each trial. Next, these segments were scanned for blink-related and other artifacts by calculating the mean and standard deviation (SD) for pupil width and by then removing data points for which pupil width fell 2 SDs above or below the mean. This procedure was applied because we assumed that pronounced pupil dilatation changes were unlikely given that lighting was consistent during MR scanning and throughout the entire duration of the experimental task. Consequently, rapid large changes in pupil width should reflect blinks (which cause the pupil to be temporarily covered by the eye lid) or scanner-related distortions which could temporarily disrupt the eye tracker’s pupil detection algorithm, resulting in incorrect gaze coordinates. Next, point-to-point absolute distances between data points were calculated and summed separately for x and y gaze point coordinates, yielding quantitative horizontal (x) and vertical (y) eye movement parameters for each trial. These parameters thus reflected the average cumulative distance the eyes “travelled” per trial/volume. Larger values reflected more eye movement, irrespective of direction or type of movement. For example, scores close to one for horizontal eye movement indicated that the eyes traveled a distance equivalent to the length of the stimulus display. Quantitative eye movement parameters were also determined for each volume acquired during scanning to generate an eye movement regressor to be included in the functional MRI analysis (see below for details). 


### Analysis of working memory behavioral data 
  
Accuracy, RT, and quantitative eye movement parameters obtained during fMRI scanning were analyzed with separate 2 × 2 repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with   load   (high or low) and   stimulus quality   (non-degraded or degraded) as within-subject factors. Post hoc   t   tests were performed to resolve interactions. The significance level was set to   p   < 0.05. 


### MRI data acquisition and analysis 
  
MRI data were acquired using a 3.0 T Philips Intera scanner (Philips, Eindhoven, NL). The structural MRI protocol consisted of a T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (TR = 6.97 ms; TE = 3.3 ms; TI = 982 ms; flip angle = 8°, in-plane resolution = 0.75 mm; slice thickness = 1 mm; 170 sagittal slices; FOV = 240 mm; 1 NEX). Functional MRI data were collected using three T2*-weighted gradient echo EPI pulse sequences (TR = 1000 ms; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 61°; in-plane resolution = 2.75 mm; slice thickness = 6 mm, gap = 1 mm; 20 oblique-axial slices; FOV = 240 mm; 1 NEX). Images were acquired in the oblique-axial plane rotated 25° clockwise with respect to the AC-PC line to optimize imaging of the cerebellum and neocortex. Application of a 1000 ms TR, jittered trial onsets, variable duration in the maintenance phase, and no-probe trials has been used previously to analyze the separate encoding, maintenance and retrieval phases of the task, and simulations confirmed that voxels responding to any combination of the three task phases could be identified (Chen and Desmond  ). The number of acquired volumes within each of the three runs ranged from 944–953. The start of the fMRI scan was synchronized with the start of each experimental run using E-prime software (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Sharpsburg, PA, USA). 

SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) was used for preprocessing and statistical computations. Standard image preprocessing steps were performed: slice timing correction (reference = middle slice), motion correction, anatomical co-registration, normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotaxic space, spatial smoothing (FWHM = 5 mm). Normalization was performed based on gray and white matter segmentation as implemented in SPM. This procedure involves combining registration to standardized space and tissue classification (as gray matter, white matter, or cerebrospinal fluid) in a single generative model that includes parameters for volume intensity non-uniformity (Ashburner and Friston  ). This procedure has been shown to yield cerebellar output that closely corresponds to that of SUIT (as opposed to the SPM default non-linear normalization method, see Diedrichsen et al.  ). 


### First-level fMRI analysis 
  
Individual statistical maps were computed for each subject using the general linear model approach as implemented in SPM8, with high-pass filtering of 128 s. Since the present investigation focused on whether sensory acquisition processes could be responsible for working memory load-dependent activations, fMRI analysis was focused on the encoding phase of the task, but the other task phases (maintenance and retrieval) were nevertheless also modelled in the GLM, as were the high vs low load and degraded vs non-degraded trial types. Thus, because there were two load conditions, two stimulus quality conditions, and trials were divided into three phases, each scan had a total of 12 task-related regressors for first-level analysis. The duration of these regressors was 2 s for the encoding phase, 4 or 6 s for the maintenance phase, and 3 s for the retrieval phase. For no-probe trials, the retrieval phase was omitted. For fMRI analyses, these regressors were convolved with the SPM canonical hemodynamic response function. Only correct trials were modelled, given that overall performance accuracy was very high (94.5%). Additional regressors of no interest for each scan included motion parameters computed from motion correction and artifacts identified with Artifact Detection Tools (ART;  ), a toolbox for fMRI post-processing optimized for artifact removal. Because each subject completed three scans total for the fMRI session, the GLM for first-stage analysis included all three scans, and contrasts were pooled across these scans. Contrasts of interest that were included in the second-stage (random effects) analysis were specific to the encoding phase and included working memory load (high–low), stimulus quality (degraded–non-degraded), and the load x stimulus quality interaction. These were each implemented as   t   test contrasts. 


### Second-level fMRI analysis 
  
Second-level (random effects) analyses were performed by computing (from the first level analysis) one contrast volume per subject for the working memory load, stimulus quality, and load × quality interaction contrasts, and then using these volumes to calculate one-sample   t   test values at every voxel (testing the null hypothesis that the contrast value was 0). Because behavioral analyses indicated that eye movements’ differences during the encoding phases of degraded vs non-degraded stimulus trials approached significance, in the fMRI second-level analysis of the degraded–non-degraded contrast, trial-wise eye movement parameters were included as a co-variate. The analysis strategy at group level was to first identify cerebellar activations in left and right hemispheral lobule VI/Crus I and vermis, which have been shown to exhibit a significant working memory load effect (high > low) in previous studies (Chen and Desmond  ,  ; Desmond et al.  ). We identified these clusters in the designated regions using a voxel-wise significance level of   p   < 0.005. These clusters were used to create activation-defined regions of interest (ROIs), consisting of all contiguous voxels that reached the   p   value threshold. Further analyses of stimulus quality were conducted on these ROIs using a small volume correction (voxel-wise   p   < 0.005 threshold, peak FWE-corrected   p   < 0.05). In addition, we performed FWE-corrected (voxel-wise   p   < 0.005 threshold, peak FWE-corrected   p   < 0.05) whole brain analysis of the stimulus quality effect (degraded > non-degraded), and subsequently analyzed the load effect (high > low) in brain regions that showed greater activation for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli. To further examine if additional regions of the brain were responsive to both sensory acquisition demand and working memory load, we performed an additional conjunction analysis in which voxels that were significant for both load and stimulus quality contrasts (at a voxel-wise   p   < 0.05 to maximize potential regions of overlap) were identified. We then examined peak activation within these clusters to identify all conjunction regions in which peak activation within the cluster exceeded   p   < 0.005 for both the load contrast and for the stimulus quality contrast. 

MNI coordinates of activation peaks were transformed into the coordinate system of the Talairach and Tourneaux stereotaxic atlas (Talairach et al.  ) using the MNI to Talairach transformation described by Lancaster et al. ( ) to make anatomical determinations of the neocortical activations (which were verified by manual inspection). However, MNI coordinates are reported in tables and figures. For the cerebellum, MNI coordinates were referenced with the SUIT atlas (Diedrichsen et al.  ). 



## Results 
  
### Behavioral data 
  
Mean percentages of correct responses according to load and stimulus quality are provided in Fig.  a. For accuracy, the ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of load (F[1, 14] = 7.492,   p   = 0.016), indicating that response accuracy was higher for trials with low (mean = 95.74%, SE = 0.57) relative to high cognitive load (mean = 93.33%, SE = 0.69). Moreover, there was a trend for a main effect of stimulus quality F[1, 14] = 3.276,   p   = 0.092), reflecting slightly better performance for non-degraded (mean = 95.27%, SE = 0.62) compared to degraded stimuli (mean = 93.80%, SE = 0.60). The load x stimulus quality interaction failed to reach significance (  p   = 0.395).

Mean RTs for correct responses according to load and stimulus quality are provided in Fig.  b. The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of load (F[1, 14] = 60.188,   p   < 0.001), with longer RTs when cognitive load was high (mean = 836 ms, SE = 34) compared to low (mean = 720 ms, SE = 30). No other effects reached statistical significance (all   p  ’s > 0.461). 

Eye movement means according to load and stimulus quality are provided in Fig.  c. Note that scores close to one for horizontal eye movement (as observed in the present task) suggest that the eyes traveled a distance equivalent to the length of the whole stimulus display which ranged from positional coordinate [0] for the left side to [1] for the right side. Eye movement analysis did not reveal any significant main effects or interactions (all   p  ’s > 0.274), although there was a trend for a significant main effect of stimulus quality (F[1, 14] = 2.974,   p   = 0.107), pointing towards more movement for degraded (mean = 0.89, SE = 0.12) relative to non-degraded stimuli (mean = 0.86, SE = 0.11). 


### Imaging data 
  
BOLD signal changes for the load effect were observed in mainly three cerebellar regions. Left hemispheral lobule VI, right hemispheral lobule VI, and vermis Crus II (see Fig.   and Table  ) all showed greater activation for high compared to low load. Subsequent analysis of stimulus quality effects in these load-dependent activation-defined cerebellar ROIs yielded significantly increased activation for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli only in vermis Crus II (see Fig.  ), but no interaction of load and stimulus quality was observed.

Additional analyses of extra-cerebellar effects of stimulus quality were investigated in a whole brain analysis. Consistent with the behavioral results found from our initial test of increased sensory acquisition demand by degraded stimuli (i.e., increased RT for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli), greater activation for degraded vs non-degraded stimuli was found in a cluster in the left fusiform gyrus and a cluster in right inferior occipital gyrus, further indicating that the degradation manipulation had indeed increased sensory acquisition demand (see Fig.   and Table  ). Using the respective activation-defined ROIs in left fusiform gyrus and right inferior occipital gyrus as ROIs, subsequent analyses of load identified only a small cluster in left fusiform gyrus that showed greater activation for high relative to low load; there were no suprathreshold clusters in the right inferior occipital region. However, fusiform activations were much more extensive for the stimulus quality effect than for the load effect.

The conjunction analysis of working memory load and stimulus quality revealed only three regions in which peak activity in the conjunction region reached   p   < 0.005 for both contrasts, the left fusiform gyrus region shown in Fig.  , the Vermis Crus II region shown in Figs.  ,  , and a 900 mm  region in the left middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann Area 6) located at MNI coordinates -34, 0, 46 using the load contrast peak, and at coordinates -36, 2, 46 using the stimulus quality contrast peak. 



## Discussion 
  
The present study investigated whether cerebellar activations in a verbal working memory task were modulated by perceptual demands. In line with the a priori hypothesis, and in support of sensory acquisition as a general function of the cerebellum, load-dependent activations in vermis Crus II scaled with sensory acquisition demand and were increased for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli. In contrast, activations in bilateral hemispheral lobule VI, which were also increased for high compared to low cognitive load, were unaffected by stimulus quality. In general, this result pattern suggests that the cerebellar hemispheres are involved in articulatory processing and representation, while perceptual processes related to the prediction of visual stimuli from partial representations occur in the vermis. Of note, cerebellar activations in the present study cannot be attributed to motor effects since eye movements were used as covariates in the analysis. 

The remarkably uniform neuroarchitecture of the cerebellum and the identification of distinct reciprocal loops that connect different cerebellar regions to distinct motor and cognitive regions in the neocortex (Middleton and Strick  ; Strick et al.  ) have inspired a search for overarching, domain-independent functions of the cerebellum. To date, a range of such functions have been proposed, e.g., prediction and internal models (Ito  ; Wolpert et al.  ), general functions of performance monitoring (Peterburs and Desmond  ), automatization (Balsters and Ramnani  ), timing (Ivry  ), and sensory acquisition (Bower  ). The present study was aimed to further investigate the notion that the cerebellum is involved in perceptual processes (Baumann et al.  ), and here specifically sensory acquisition. A Sternberg verbal working memory task was used because this type of task has been shown to reliably produce robust cerebellar activation patterns that inform about distinct functional roles of specific cerebellar subregions (e.g., Chen and Desmond  ,  ; Desmond et al.  ). Since sensory acquisition processes are most critical during initial stimulus encoding, data analysis in the present study focused on the encoding phase of the Sternberg task. In accordance with previous findings (Chein and Fiez  ; Chen and Desmond  ,  ; Kirschen et al.  ), cognitive load, i.e., the number of letters to be encoded into an articulatory code, modulated activations bilaterally in the cerebellar hemispheres in lobule VI. In previous studies, activations in right lobule VI occurred concordant with activations in left inferior frontal cortex, linking them to articulatory representations (Chein and Fiez  ; Chen and Desmond  ). 

Interestingly, in the present study, a smaller region in vermis Crus II was also sensitive to the load effect, with increased activation for high relative to low load. Importantly, activations in this region were also modulated by stimulus quality: in line with our a priori hypothesis, degraded stimuli that required more sensory processing than non-degraded stimuli, as confirmed by increased RTs in a separate behavioral test of the stimuli, were associated with increased activation. These effects of load and stimulus quality on activity in vermis Crus II are particularly interesting, because this area was shown to both receive projections from area 46 (middle frontal gyrus/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and project back to this area (rather than to M1 or oculomotor regions) in a primate neurophysiology study using neurotropic virus tracing in macaques (Kelly and Strick  ). Human area 46 and macaque area 46 were also shown to closely match in terms of cortical functional connectivity in a later study (Neubert et al.  ), corroborating the notion of functional correspondence. Importantly, area 46 has been implicated in working memory for different types of stimuli in a large number of studies (for a meta-analysis of fMRI studies, see Owen et al.  ), and the present findings of memory load and stimulus quality effects in a cerebellar region densely connected to area 46 are well in line with this. 

Apart from vermis Crus II, increased activation for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli was also found in the visual cortex in right inferior occipital gyrus and left fusiform gyrus. The left fusiform gyrus also showed load-dependent activation differences, albeit to a much lesser degree than the modulation by stimulus quality. Overall, this result pattern is consistent with increased sensory and attentional demand for degraded compared to non-degraded stimuli. Of note, adjacent vermal regions of lobule VI have been linked to processing of visual motion cues (Baumann and Mattingley  ) as well as biological motion based on point-light animations (e.g., Ferrari et al.  ), while vermis lobule VII/Crus II has been associated with processing of emotionally salient stimuli (for a review, see Stoodley and Schmahmann  ). 

Interestingly, conjunction analysis identified (in addition to vermis Crus II and left fusiform gyrus) a small region in left middle frontal gyrus (BA 6) that was also responsive to manipulations of both load and stimulus quality. Prior work has linked BA 6 to executive processes during maintenance and thus monitoring and manipulation demands (e.g., Wager and Smith  ; Nee et al.  ). Previous studies from our lab (Desmond et al.  ; Chen and Desmond  ,  ) have linked superior cerebellar activation to posterior frontal activations associated with the articulatory control system of the Baddeley model of verbal working memory (Baddeley  ,  ). The present results extend these findings and suggest that a BA6-vermis crus II circuit could sub-serve both working memory load and sensory acquisition demands. 

In general, increased activations for decreased signal strength (and hence increased sensory demand) have previously been reported in a task in which visual and auditory motion had to be distinguished from noise (Baumann and Mattingley  ). It has been proposed that cerebellar input is used to ameliorate processing/signal acquisition in sensory regions, e.g., by facilitating computational efficiency and providing sensory data control (Bower  ). This notion was based on early fMRI investigations in the tactile domain that disentangled mere finger movement control from the use of the fingers as sensory devices (Gao et al.  ). Specifically, it was shown that activation in the dentate nucleus, the sole output node for the cerebellar hemispheres, was greater for sensory discrimination tasks with and without movement than for a task involving finger movement not associated with tactile sensory discrimination. In the auditory domain, a meta-analysis of 15 studies showed consistent cerebellar activations across a range of different simple auditory tasks that could not be attributed to attentional demand (Petacchi et al.  ), thus supporting a role for the cerebellum in auditory sensory processing that is consistent with the sensory acquisition hypothesis. In line with this, patients with cerebellar degenerative disease relative to healthy control subjects show impaired pitch discrimination despite normal hearing thresholds and similar performance in control tasks involving sustained attention and verbal auditory working memory (Parsons et al.  ). Aside from these empirical findings, a role for the cerebellum in sensory acquisition is also supported by evolutionary considerations. Paulin ( ) provided several examples of species in which lobular expansion in the cerebellum seems to track sensory demands better than motor demands. For example, echolocating microbats and whales (which have different motor requirements, i.e., bats use distal muscles for movement whereas whales use axial muscles) show similar expansion in vermal lobule VIII that is not seen in non-echolocating bats and whales. Paulin therefore proposed that the cerebellum may serve as a tracking system that is important for the control and coordination of movements which requires that moving objects as well as own movements are tracked and that sensory consequences of movements are analyzed appropriately. Importantly, the cerebellar association with passive echolocation and passive electrolocation is analogous to that found for active sensory systems, indicating that cerebellar sensory acquisition functions are not dependent on movement (Paulin  ). Along these lines, in the present working memory task with visual stimuli, it is conceivable that cerebellar input may be used to improve the prediction of stimulus identity when stimuli are degraded. This would be consistent with the notion of cerebellar internal models and predictive functions (Ito  ; Wolpert et al.  ). 

The cerebellar role in sensory acquisition yields interesting implications for processes of learning and expertise-building. A very recent study revealed a pattern of reduced cerebellar activation that accompanied higher sensory cortical activity in experienced archery athletes. In contrast, in non-athletic control participants, visual activations were found to co-occur with extensive cerebellar activation (Lo et al.  ). This result pattern appears to suggest that cerebellar sensory data control may be needed less when expertise is high, i.e., when sensory processing is already optimized. Future studies should investigate if this also applies to other non-motor functions. 

To conclude, the present findings provide partial support for the sensory acquisition hypothesis and point to an overall function of association-based prediction that may underlie general cerebellar function, with perceptual prediction of stimuli from partial representations occurring in vermal and articulatory prediction occurring in hemispheral regions. Such a function is well in line with performance monitoring accounts of cerebellar function and with the generation of internal models for both motor and non-motor functions. On the other hand, the idea of an overarching cerebellar function has been challenged by the proposal of cerebellar multiple functionality (Diedrichsen et al.  ). Along these lines, the regional non-uniformity of function observed in the present study (i.e., load but not sensory acquisition sensitivity of the cerebellar hemispheres) could also be viewed as evidence supporting cerebellar multiple functionality. More research is therefore needed to unravel the specific nature of the cerebellar involvement in well-defined task domains.

# Abstract
 
Individuals with a predisposition to empathize engage with sad music in a compelling way, experiencing overall more pleasurable emotions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these music-related experiences in empathic individuals are unknown. The present study tested whether dispositional empathy modulates neural responses to sad compared with happy music. Twenty-four participants underwent fMRI while listening to 4-min blocks of music evoking sadness or happiness. Using voxel-wise regression, we found a positive correlation between trait empathy (with scores assessed by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index) and eigenvector centrality values in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), including the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). We then performed a functional connectivity (FC) analysis to detect network nodes showing stronger FC with the vmPFC/mOFC during the presentation of sad versus happy music. By doing so, we identified a “music-empathy” network (vmPFC/mOFC, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, primary visual cortex, bilateral claustrum and putamen, and cerebellum) that is spontaneously recruited while listening to sad music and includes brain regions that support the coding of compassion, mentalizing, and visual mental imagery. Importantly, our findings extend the current understanding of empathic behaviors to the musical domain and pinpoint sad music as an effective stimulus to be employed in social neuroscience research.

## Introduction 
  
Empathy is one of the most remarkable human abilities that allows, for instance, to understand what it feels like to experience someone else’s joy or sadness and that ultimately promotes meaningful social interaction. Empathic behaviors are diverse and include resonating affectively with others’ emotions (  affective empathy   or   experience sharing  ) and comprehending others’ mental and affective states (  cognitive empathy   or   mentalizing  ) (Zaki & Ochsner,  ). While sharing another person’s positive emotion is doubtlessly pleasant, shared negative affective experiences can be challenging and may lead to   empathic distress  , a maladaptive empathic response that is associated with burnout in individuals who are routinely exposed to the suffering of others, such as physicians, nurses, and therapists (McCray et al.,  ).   Compassion   represents an alternative empathic reaction to sharing a negative emotion. In contrast to empathic distress, compassion is characterized by positive feelings of warmth and care as well as strong prosocial motivation and approach components (Singer & Klimecki,  ). Research on the neural underpinnings of affective empathy has predominantly focused on empathy for physical pain, revealing that the medial/anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insula are consistently activated during first-hand experience of pain as well as while observing another person in pain (Jackson et al.,  ; Lamm et al.,  ; Singer et al.,  ; for a meta-analysis see Lamm et al.,  ). Although the neuroimaging literature on compassion is limited compared with the one on empathy for pain, a number of studies have underlined the role of nonoverlapping brain structures, such as the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), putamen, pallidum, and ventral tegmental area, extending the dissociation between empathic distress and compassion from the psychological to the neural level (Klimecki et al.,  ; Klimecki et al.,  ). With regard to cognitive empathy, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the superior temporal sulcus/temporoparietal junction, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the temporal poles are reliably engaged when participants are asked to make judgments about targets’ beliefs, thoughts, intentions, and emotions (Denny et al.,  ; Mitchell,  ; Pehrs et al.,  ; Preckel et al.,  ; Van Overwalle & Baetens,  ). 

Although social neuroscientists have traditionally investigated empathy as an interpersonal phenomenon directed to human beings (e.g., Lamm et al.,  ), empathic responses also extend to aesthetic contexts (i.e., imagined affective experiences, beliefs, or intentions of inanimate characters of the artwork or of the artist) and, in fact, empathy is considered to be a constitutive element of the aesthetic experience in cinema (D’Aloia,  ), figurative art (Freedberg & Gallese,  ), literature (Johnson et al.,  ), and music (Levinson,  ). As argued by the philosophers Robert Vischer ( ) and Theodor Lipps ( ), appreciation of art draws crucially on the beholders’ ability to resonate with the piece of art, thereby underlining the importance of individual characteristics and suggesting that highly empathic individuals may have more intense and pleasurable aesthetic experiences. These philosophical accounts of “aesthetic” empathy have stressed its affective component rather than the cognitive one. However, mentalizing processes also are at play in aesthetic contexts, such as music listening. Similar to other art forms, music is the product of—and therefore is expressive of—human feelings, but also beliefs, and intentions. By conveying meaning and signaling inferred intentions, music can act as social agent (or virtual surrogate for social interaction; Schäfer & Eerola,  ), even in the absence of any perceptual information indicating the presence of a human agent (Livingstone & Thompson,  ). In line with this perspective, a previous fMRI study, comparing man-made music versus music that participants believed to have been generated by a computer, demonstrated that the former recruits brain areas involved in the attribution of mental states or mentalizing, such as the dmPFC (Steinbeis & Koelsch,  ). These empirical findings add to the theoretical accounts of music as a stimulus with social significance and call for a more systematic investigation of the neural correlates of empathy-related processes (both affective and cognitive) in musical contexts (Clarke et al.,  ). In particular, sad-sounding music (henceforth referred to as “sad music”) may act as a powerful and sophisticated “social” stimulus to map the empathic brain, being capable to evoke multifaceted, yet mostly pleasurable, intense affective experiences despite sadness being a negative emotion (Eerola et al.,  ; Sachs et al.,  ). 

On the behavioral level, music-and-emotion studies have provided mounting evidence, yet merely correlational in nature and limited by the use of convenience samples, of a close relationship between empathy disposition and enjoyment as well as sensitivity to sad music. Specifically, individuals who score high on self-report questionnaires of empathy, the most widely used scale being the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis,  ), experience more intense emotions, a feeling of “being moved”, and enjoyment while listening to sad music compared with individuals who score low (Eerola et al.,  ; Garrido & Schubert,  ; Kawakami & Katahira,  ; Taruffi & Koelsch,  ; Vuoskoski & Eerola,  ; Vuoskoski et al.,  ). The association between trait empathy and sad music draws not only on emotional but also cognitive aspects of empathy, as indicated by the positive correlation between the empathy subscale   fantasy   of the IRI (which assesses the tendency to transpose one’s self imaginatively into the feelings and actions of fictitious characters in books, movies, and plays; Davis,  ) and the liking as well as the intensity of sad music (Taruffi & Koelsch,  ; Vuoskoski et al.,  ). These findings suggest that sad music may trigger empathic listeners to fantasize about mental images related to the unfolding of the music. Interestingly, this is in line with recent evidence that sad (compared with happy) music is associated with higher levels of mind-wandering in the form of visual mental images and the engagement of the default mode network (Taruffi, Pehrs, et al.,  ), which overlaps to a great extent with the abovementioned core regions involved in mentalizing (e.g., Mars et al.,  ). Only one previous fMRI study investigated the neural substrates underlying the relationship between trait empathy and music, providing evidence that individual variance in trait empathy is reflected in differential recruitment of core empathy networks during music listening (Wallmark et al.,  ). Specifically, IRI subscales were found to correlate with activity in regions associated with both emotional (sensorimotor regions, insular, and cingulate cortex) and cognitive empathy (prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction) during passive listening tasks. However, this study featured only simple musical tones and 16-s music excerpts varying in familiarity (familiar and unfamiliar) and preference (liking or disliking), but not in emotional tone (e.g., sad or happy). Therefore, it remains to be tested yet whether empathic participants are particularly sensitive to sad music, showing specific empathy-related brain activity patterns. 

The present study sought to investigate whether empathic abilities relate to variation in brain network connectivity in response to sad (vs. happy) music. Participants were scanned while listening to 4-min blocks of sad and happy music and subsequently completed the IRI (Davis,  ). Functional data were analyzed using Eigenvector Centrality Mapping (ECM; Lohmann et al.,  ) and Functional Connectivity (FC), similar to a previous study that investigated “small-world” networks underlying music-evoked joy (Koelsch & Skouras,  ). ECM is a mathematical method that has been described in detail previously (Lohmann et al.,  ). For interpretational purposes, ECM derives a measure of Eigenvector Centrality (EC) for each voxel within a brain volume, based on timeseries data from each and every other voxel within the same brain volume. Through an iterative self-referential procedure, ECM considers the patterns of interconnectivity across all voxels. The derived EC values correspond to the level of influence that each voxel exerts over the entire brain volume activation pattern. Note that EC values do not only take the number of connections of a voxel into account, but also the importance of connected voxels. For instance, Google's PageRank algorithm was based on EC, such that web domains were not only ranked higher when more other pages linked to them, but also when those linking pages themselves were pages to which more other pages linked. Thus, ECM can reveal influential, or important, hubs of neural networks in the human brain. In this study, first a second-level regression analysis was performed voxel-wise, with IRI scores as the predictor and EC values from the contrasts between emotion conditions as the outcome variable. Then, the cluster identified by this analysis was used as seed region in a subsequent FC analysis that was performed to identify a network of brain regions underlying empathic individuals’ responses evoked by sad compared with happy music. We expected to observe the engagement of brain regions that are involved in compassion and positive affect, in particular the mOFC (Klimecki et al.,  ; Klimecki et al.,  ). This hypothesis was motivated by the fact that empathic individuals show an enhanced enjoyment of sad music, suggesting that they exhibit patterns of empathic reactions to negatively valenced stimuli that are more aligned with compassion rather than emotional distress. In addition, given the association between cognitive aspects of dispositional empathy and the liking of sad music (Taruffi & Koelsch,  ; Vuoskoski et al.,  ), we anticipated the engagement of mentalizing brain regions, specifically the dmPFC, because of its role in social inferences of traits and scripts about other people (Van Overwalle,  ). Moreover, the recruitment of the dmPFC has previously been observed in music studies exploring: (  i  ) neural associations with trait empathy (Wallmark et al.,  ); (  ii  ) internally oriented cognitive experiences, such as mind-wandering in response to sad music (Taruffi, Pehrs, et al.,  ); and (  iii  ) attribution of mental states (Steinbeis & Koelsch,  ). We finally expected that trait empathy would be associated with activity in the visual cortex, given that previous findings suggested enhanced visual mental imagery processes during listening to sad music (Taruffi, Pehrs, et al.,  ). 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Twenty-four (12 females) right-handed, native German speakers with no history of neurological problems participated in this study (mean age = 25.3, age range 21-34). Participants were screened for depressive symptoms, alexithymia (alexithymia is associated with difficulties in perception of sadness conveyed by music; Taruffi, Allen, et al.,  ), and sensitivity to music reward, using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR; Rush et al.,  ), the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20; Bagby et al.,  ), and the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire (BMRQ; Mas-Herrero et al.,  ), respectively. All participants scored below 6 on the QIDS-SR and 52 on the TAS-20; thus, none of the participants were depressive or alexithymic. With regard to the BMRQ, all participants scored between 40 and 60 on the two factors of   emotion evocation   and   mood regulation  , indicating an average sensitivity to reward derived from music-evoked emotional experiences. None of the participants were professional musicians. 58.3% of the participants were nonmusicians, 29.2% amateur musicians, and 12.5% semiprofessional musicians. Participants’ favorite musical genres fell into the following categories: 25.7% rock, 20% electronic, 15.7% pop, 15.7% classical and soundtrack, 12.8% jazz, 5.7% reggae, and 4.4 % other. All participants provided informed consent in a manner approved by the Ethics Committee of the Freie Universität Berlin, and the experiment was performed in accordance with ethical standards outlined by the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants either received course credit or 10€/h for participation. 


### Music stimuli 
  
The stimulus set consisted of four pairs of sad-happy excerpts of instrumental film soundtracks, capable of evoking sad and happy emotions, respectively. Each sad-happy pair had the same tempo (measured in beats per minute, BPM) and featured an acoustically identical beat track, leading to the same perceived tempo and similar vestibular responses for sad and happy music (for more information about the stimulus preparation see Taruffi, Pehrs, et al.,  ). There were four “short” (35–37 s) and four “long” (1.18–1.30 min) excerpts, counterbalanced across conditions. All excerpts were edited to have 1.5-s fade in/out ramps and were RMS (root mean square) normalized to have the same loudness. Stimuli of the same emotion category were concatenated into blocks of 4-min duration (no stimulus was repeated) to ensure optimal data for the application of ECM analysis, which typically requires relatively long trial periods but has the advantage that only one trial per condition is sufficient per subject (Lohmann et al.,  ). 


### Self-report measure of trait empathy 
  
Individual differences in trait empathy were measured through the validated German version (Paulus,  ) of the IRI (Davis,  ). The IRI is one of the most commonly used self-report questionnaires of dispositional empathy, which builds on a multidimensional conceptualization of empathy, including cognitive and affective aspects, and has been consistently used in previous studies that examined the relationship between sad music and trait empathy (e.g., Vuoskoski et al.,  ). Global empathy scores showed a   M   of 15.4 and a   SD   of 1.37 (corresponding   M   of German population norms = 14.49, and   SD   = 3.17; Paulus,  ). 


### Procedure 
  
Because familiarity can strongly affect music-evoked emotions and their neural correlates (Pereira et al.,  ), approximately two weeks before the scanning session the participants were tested on their familiarity with the music stimuli to ensure that they were unfamiliar with the selected music excerpts. Participants listened to short excerpts (15 s) of the stimuli and indicated their familiarity with each excerpt on a scale ranging from 1 (“I have never heard this piece before”) to 5 (“I know this piece”). Participants were not included in the fMRI session if they were familiar with any of the music pieces. A paired   t  -test showed that there was no significant difference in familiarity between the happy [1.62 ± 0.57 (  M   ±   SD  )] and the sad pieces (1.57 ± 0.63),   P   > 0.05. 

In the scanning session, participants listened to the 4-min sad and happy music blocks presented in a pseudo-randomized order. Stimuli were presented via MRI-compatible headphones (under which participants wore earplugs) at a comfortable volume level and participants were instructed to close their eyes and relax during the music listening. Each music block was followed by: (  i  ) a 2-s signal tone indicating participants to open their eyes; (  ii  ) a 16-s evaluation period during which participants were asked to indicate their overall emotional state during the 4-min music period using a response pad they held in their right hands; and (  iii  ) a 10-s silence period to avoid emotional crossover between different blocks of stimuli. 

For the emotion evaluation in response to the music, participants were instructed to focus on their emotional experience (i.e.,   felt emotions  ) rather than the emotional tone that the music was intended to convey (i.e.,   perceived emotion  ). We decided to assess only   felt emotions  , because the link between trait empathy and sad music has been reported mainly on experiential rather than perceptual level (e.g., Vuoskoski, & Eerola,  ). Furthermore, no clear findings are available to substantiate the claim that behavioral differences between felt and perceived emotions correspond to separate underlying neural correlates (e.g., Koelsch,  ). Participants rated their felt emotions on four 6-point scales representing valence (“How unpleasant/pleasant did you feel during the music listening?”), arousal (“How calm/aroused did you feel during the music listening?”), sadness (“How sad did you feel during the music listening?”), and happiness (“How happy did you feel during the music listening?”). The answer scales ranged from 1 (“very unpleasant”, “very calm”, “not at all”) to 6 (“very pleasant”, “very aroused”, “very much so”). 

The total length of the fMRI session was approximately 27 min and, besides the two experimental conditions, included also listening to two blocks of dissonant and neutral music as well as a resting state scanning session with no music (these scans were acquired to fulfill other research purposes). All 24 participants completed the IRI after the scanning session. 


### fMRI data acquisition and data analysis 
  
MRI data were acquired on a 3T Siemens Magnetom Trio MRI scanner, at the Dahlem Institute for Neuroimaging of Emotion. Before functional scanning, a high-resolution (1 × 1 × 1 mm) T1-weighted anatomical reference image was obtained from each participant using a rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence. Functional data were acquired using a continuous echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (37 slices interleaved; slice thickness = 3 mm; interslice gap = 0.6 mm; TE = 30 ms; TR = 2,250 ms; flip angle = 70°; matrix = 64x64; FOV = 192 x 192 mm). To minimize susceptibility artifacts in areas, such as the orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal lobes, the acquisition window was tilted at an angle of 30° to the intercommissural (AC-PC) plane (Deichmann et al.,  ; Weiskopf et al.,  ), similar to previous studies (Koelsch et al.,  ; Koelsch & Skouras,  ). 

Functional images were preprocessed and analyzed using LIPSIA 2.1 (Lohmann et al.,  ). Each participant’s anatomical T1 data were used to derive nonlinear transformation matrices between the participant’s native space and MNI-space. Data were corrected for slicetime acquisition, realigned and normalized, by applying the derived transformation matrices, into MNI-space-registered images with isotropic voxels of 3 mm . A high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1/90 Hz was used to remove low-frequency drifts in the fMRI time-series, and a spatial smoothing was performed using a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full-width at half-maximum. The mean signal value per scanned volume was computed and regressed out of each participant's data. To control for motion artifacts, the movement parameters of each participant also were regressed out of the respective fMRI time-series. 

Whole-brain EC maps were computed separately for each participant during each 4-min experimental condition. Global empathy scores were used as the regressor of interest, with age and gender as covariates of no interest (as in Koelsch et al.,  ), in a second-level design matrix comparing EC between the two experimental conditions using voxel-wise paired sample   t  -tests. Regression was used, because empathy scores were normally distributed, as confirmed by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D(24) = 0.16,   P   > 0.05. Results of this multiple regression analysis were corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster-size and cluster-value thresholds obtained by Monte Carlo simulations with a significance level of   P   < 0.05 (Lohmann et al.,  ). 

FC analysis was conducted using as seed region the cluster identified by the above-described voxel-wise regression analysis between EC and empathy scores. The average time-course of activity within the seed region was extracted and regressed against activity in the rest of the brain, separately for the sad and happy music conditions. FC maps were first computed separately for each participant and later normalized across the whole sample. Then, FC maps were compared between the two experimental conditions using paired sample   t  -tests corrected for multiple comparisons (using cluster-size and cluster-value thresholds obtained by Monte Carlo simulations with a significance level of   P   < 0.05; Lohmann et al.,  ). 



## Results 
  
### Behavioral results 
  
Paired   t  -tests showed that valence ratings did not significantly differ between sad (4.29 ± 1.46) and happy music (5.21 ± 0.88),   P   = 0.013 (Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of .012), suggesting that sad music also was associated to some extent with pleasurable emotional experiences. Similarly, arousal ratings did not significantly differ between sad (3.21 ± 1.18) and happy music (3.75 ± 0.9),   P   = 0.04 (Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of 0.012), in accordance with the use of music stimuli controlled for tempo characteristics. Furthermore, sadness ratings were significantly higher during sad (4.54 ± 0.83) compared with happy music (1.5 ± 0.83),   t  (23) = 10.90,   P   < 0.001. Inversely, happiness ratings were significantly higher during happy (5.42 ± 0.72) compared with sad music (2.71 ± 1.27),   t  (23) = 8.74,   P   < 0.001. 


### fMRI results 
  
Significant positive correlations between EC and the total empathy scores were observed in a cluster of voxels located in the vmPFC, including (but not restricted to) the mOFC (Fig.  ; Table  ), suggesting that the vmPFC is more crucial to emotional processes in people with high empathy scores. This EC cluster exhibited significantly stronger functional connectivity during sad than during happy music with the dmPFC, primary visual cortex (V ), bilateral claustrum (CL), putamen (PT), and cerebellum (CB) (Fig.  ; Table  ). The V  exhibited the strongest connectivity and was by far the largest target region identified (Table  ). Conversely, no region was found to show significantly stronger functional connectivity with the vmPFC/mOFC during happy compared with sad music.

## Discussion 
  
This study explored how dispositional empathy modulates neural responses to sad (compared with happy) music. Previous behavioral investigations highlighted that the experience underlying listening to sad music is highly modulated by trait empathy, which leads to variability in emotional valence. Using ECM in combination with FC, we demonstrate that individual differences in trait empathy are associated with higher centrality within a distributed network of brain areas encompassing vmPFC/mOFC, dmPFC, V , CL/PT, and CB, which are engaged while listening to sad (vs. happy) music. The vmPFC/mOFC acts as a “computational hub” and the remaining brain areas as functionally connected nodes. 

In accordance with our hypothesis, the ECM results revealed that empathy scores correlated with centrality values in the mOFC (part of a larger cluster covering the vmPFC). The mOFC has been recently indicated as core hub of the compassion network (Singer & Klimecki,  ). Specifically, activations of the mOFC have been reported in meditation-naïve participants who, after following a short-term compassion training, were exposed to short film excerpts depicting human suffering (Klimecki et al.,  ). Furthermore, patients with damage in the vmPFC exhibit impaired empathy, poor decision making, and a deterioration of “moral character,” because they are unable to generate the feelings that guide adaptive decision making in healthy individuals (Anderson et al.,  ; Bechara et al.,  ; Shamay-Tsoory,  ). Similarly, activations of the vmPFC have been previously related to affective empathy (Hynes et al.,  ; Mobbs et al.,  ; Saxe,  ; Völlm et al.,  ), in particular to empathy for positive emotions (Morelli et al.,  ). In light of these previous findings, the observed data suggest that listeners with a predisposition to empathize took a compassionate, rather than distressed, stance toward sad music. This is in line with (  i  ) the observed high centrality in two bilateral clusters encompassing the PT (Table  ), another core region of the compassion network (Klimecki et al.,  ), and (  ii  ) the fact that we did not observe activity in regions typically involved in empathy for pain (Jackson et al.,  ; Lamm et al.,  ; Singer et al.,  ). Notably, our finding ties in well with the music-and-emotion literature revealing that enjoyment of sad music is positively correlated with trait empathy (Garrido & Schubert,  ; Kawakami & Katahira,  ; Taruffi & Koelsch,  ; Vuoskoski, et al.,  ). It is important to mention that, in this study, the observed centrality of the vmPFC/mOFC was not a result of familiarity effects with sad music (as in Wallmark et al.,  ). Sad and happy stimuli were in fact controlled for familiarity and participants were equally unfamiliar to both emotion conditions (see   Methods  ). 

We obtained also evidence for the involvement of the dmPFC, which exhibited functional connectivity with the vmPFC/mOFC during sad compared with happy music. The dmPFC plays a pivotal role in mentalizing (e.g., Amodio & Frith,  ), and specifically in the attribution of enduring traits and qualities about others (Van Overwalle,  ). Interestingly, activity in the dmPFC predicts altruistic behavior (Moll et al.,  ; Waytz et al.,  ), consistent with the view that prosocial tendencies rely on the capacity to understand the minds of others. In line with our result, a previous music study found that trait empathy correlates with activity in the mPFC during listening to familiar versus unfamiliar music (Wallmark et al.,  ). Therefore, the observed functional connection between the vmPFC/mOFC and dmPFC may suggest that empathic participants engaged with mentalizing-related computations, such as, e.g., fantasizing about other people or fictional characters to undergo imagined events. Levinson ( ) has previously argued that experiencing music as a narrative is one compelling way through which listeners empathize with the music (another common music-empathy mechanism is   emotional contagion  , where the listener internally mirrors the perceived emotional expression of music by means of physiological feedback of muscular and autonomic activity; Juslin & Västfjäll,  ; Lundqvist et al.,  ). This mechanism of cognitive empathy in music is similar to what readers do with a novel's fictional character (Tamir et al.,  ), but with the difference that listeners can imagine their own narrative unfolding on the basis of the musical events. Notably, simulation of other people’s minds during reading is crucially supported by the default mode network and in particular by the dmPFC, which responds preferentially to passage with social and abstract content (Tamir et al.,  ). 

The observed functional connection between vmPFC and V  during sad compared with happy music is in line with our hypothesis, suggesting an association between visual mental imagery processes and listening to sad music, although the causal direction of this relationship requires further investigation. Neuroimaging literature has provided clear evidence of a large overlap between visual perception and visual imagery. Specifically, the early visual cortex (V ) supports the construction of visual mental images (Kosslyn & Thompson,  ). This parallel between cognitive resources involved in imagery and perception also largely applies to the other sensory modalities (Kosslyn et al.,  ). Music very often stimulates internal images in the listener (Küssner & Eerola,  ), consisting of pictorial representations (natural landscape, colors), embodied image-schemata (picturing a melodic movement as an ascending or descending image), or complex visual narratives (similar to a movie) (Taruffi & Küssner,  ). Sad music has been found to trigger enhanced mind-wandering in the form of visual mental imagery with emotion- and nature-related content (Taruffi, Pehrs, et al.,  ). Moreover, previous fMRI studies of music and emotion reported the engagement of the primary and secondary visual cortices during music listening (Koelsch & Skouras,  ; Trost et al.,  ; Wallmark et al.,  ). In these experiments—as in the current one—participants underwent scanning with their eyes closed. Therefore, the present data support our hypothesis that individuals who are prone to empathize exhibit enhanced activity of V  and that this pattern is more pronounced during listening to sad compared with happy instrumental film music. Importantly, of the observed functionally connected structures, V  exhibited the highest centrality values and was by far the largest region, suggesting that visual mental imagery might be a central mechanism underlying empathic individuals’ responses to sad music. Furthermore, these findings lead to the intriguing hypothesis to be tested by future research that experiencing vivid visual mental imagery may facilitate empathic participants to transpose themselves into the feelings and thoughts of their imagined characters or events during the music. 

Of particular interest is the functional connection between the vmPFC and bilateral CL during sad compared with happy music. The CL—whose function has remained rather obscure to date—is a thin, irregular sheet of gray matter that lies below the general region of the insular cortex and above the PT (Crick & Koch,  ). The CL has extensive reciprocal connections to almost all cortical areas and also to a number of subcortical areas, including lateral amygdala, caudate, PT, and globus pallidus (Fernandez-Miranda et al.,  ; LeVay & Sherk,  ; Park et al.,  ). Due to these widespread connections, Crick and Koch ( ) proposed that the CL synchronizes and binds separate multisensory information, including perceptual, cognitive, motor and emotional content, to form a unitary, single object, thus serving as a consciousness center for the brain. This proposal is consistent with a number of neuroimaging studies showing the involvement of the CL in tasks in which integration of multimodal information is required (Banati et al.,  ; Baugh et al.,  ). Changes in claustral activity in neuroimaging studies of music and emotion are rather uncommon; however, this may be due to the small size of the CL and its proximity to the insula (i.e., instead more commonly engaged during music listening; see, for example, Caria et al.,  ), which make it challenging to discriminate between claustral and insular activity. The functional connectivity between vmPFC and CL observed in the present study is consistent with anatomical bidirectional projections from the CL to the PFC (Park et al.,  ; Tanné-Gariépy et al.,  ) and suggests a role of the CL in the integration of the different affective, perceptual, and cognitive processes underlying listening to sad music. Regarding the functional connection between vmPFC and CB, changes in cerebellar activity have been previously linked to dispositional empathy (Jackson et al.,  ; Moriguchi et al.,  ; Singer et al.,  ). In particular in the study by Singer et al. ( ), individuals scoring higher on empathy (as measured by the empathic concern subscale of the IRI and the Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale from Mehrabian & Epstein,  ) showed higher pain-related activity in ACC, left AI, and also lateral right cerebellum. Another possible interpretation could be related to rhythmic entrainment. The cerebellum is involved in the neural tracking of rhythm (e.g., Nozaradan et al.,  ), and trait empathy is positively associated with (sensorimotor) rhythmic entrainment abilities (e.g., Bamford & Davidson,  ). 

In the broad context, our findings extend the current understanding of empathic behaviors to the musical, and in general aesthetic, domain. In line with the previous account of compassion as a social emotion characterized by a concern for another person’s suffering, which is accompanied by positive feelings and a motivation to help (Singer & Klimecki,  ), our study shows that trait empathy is correlated with centrality values within brain regions (mOFC and PT) that are crucially involved in the generation of compassionate feelings also in response to music—an abstract stimulus that does not contain any explicit reference to a human agent. In addition, in our study empathic participants exhibited enhanced centrality values in brain regions that typically underlie social cognition (dmFPC) and mental imagery (V ). Overall, these centrality patterns were specific for sad music, suggesting that this type of music may constitute an effective social signal that triggers specific empathy-related processes in individuals who are already prone to empathy. Although we did not find any significant result for the contrast happy versus sad, our findings do not exclude the possibility that the observed patterns of centrality during sad music also may be at play during happy music. People may find it easier to engage with happy rather than sad music, given that the latter represents a more complex emotion with positive and negative nuances, which could be more readily available to empathic individuals who are prone to transfer themselves into others’ emotions and perspectives; such difference may consequently lead to a range of more sophisticated or enhanced neural responses to sad music in high-empathy participants (e.g., integrating complex affective and cognitive processes), as suggested by the present study. 

Furthermore, our findings underscore the importance of considering individual differences when investigating the neural mechanisms underlying musical experiences. This is particularly relevant for the case of sad music, where individual characteristics play a key role. A piece of sad music can be associated with feelings of sorrow or be experienced as pleasurable by someone else. Therefore, future neuroimaging research should foster experimental paradigms that take into account the variance brought about by individual differences in emotional responses to music. Although previous accounts of music-empathy focused predominantly on emotional contagion (e.g., Davies,  ; Juslin & Västfjäll,  ; Lundqvist et al.,  ), our study points to more sophisticated forms of empathy, involving compassion, mentalizing, and fantasy processes. Clearly, this could be due to the particular music genre of the stimuli employed in this study—film soundtrack—and a question arises about the extent to which the current results can be generalized to other music genres. Film music is in fact particularly effective in facilitating listeners to conjure up visual images and to evoke intense emotions as well as vivid daydreams. Therefore, this issue should be addressed by future research employing stimuli from other music genres. 

In future studies, it would be important to show how in empathic individuals the observed neural activity pattern maps onto behavioral responses to sad music. Our data along with evidence collected by previous studies (Eerola et al.,  ; Garrido & Schubert,  ; Kawakami & Katahira,  ; Taruffi & Koelsch,  ; Vuoskoski & Eerola,  ; Vuoskoski et al.,  ) suggest that empathic individuals experience more complex emotional responses toward sad music, including both positive and negative facets. However, this needs to be validated by using a more thorough behavioral assessment in the scanner. Nevertheless, our study still provides an intriguing step forward in the scholarship concerning empathy and sad music by showing that a unique network of brain regions related to individual differences in trait empathy is significantly more active for sad music than for happy music. Finally, although we estimated our target sample on previous research that successfully identified neural correlates of emotional personality using music (Koelsch et al.,  ), we underline here the necessity for future research to increase sample size. Because our sample is relatively small in the context of individual differences research, it could be possible that more potential results have been missed. 


## Conclusions 
  
This study identified a distributed brain network associated with individual differences in trait empathy and spontaneously recruited during listening to sad music. This “music-empathy” network comprises brain regions subserving coding of compassion, mentalizing, and visual mental imagery. In addition, a novel site of activation was found in the CL, showing its involvement in a music listening task. Our study contributes to the increasingly sophisticated understanding of the empathic brain, mapping neural dynamics to specific individual characteristics. In this sense, our results are promising because they suggest that the variation in brain-network connectivity provides a valid marker of empathic abilities. Moreover, the fact that music acts as a social stimulus—by triggering empathic individuals to undergo enhanced emotional and cognitive experiences—opens novel possibilities, involving the use of music tasks, for social neurosciences and, in general, speaks about the importance of empathy in aesthetic contexts (an issue that has been discussed by philosophers but mostly overlooked by neuroscientists).

# Abstract
 
Although two thirds of patients with a cocaine use disorder (CUD) are female, little is known about sex differences in the (neuro)pathology of CUD. The aim of this explorative study was to investigate sex‐dependent differences in prefrontal cortex (PFC) functioning during a working memory (WM) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task in regular cocaine users (CUs), as PFC deficits are implicated in the shift from recreational cocaine use to CUD. Neural activation was measured using fMRI during a standard WM task (n‐back task) in 27 male and 28 female CUs and in 26 male and 28 female non‐cocaine users (non‐CUs). Although there were no main or interaction effects of sex and group on n‐back task performance, WM‐related (2‐back > 0‐back) PFC functioning was significantly moderated by sex and group: female compared with male CUs displayed higher WM‐related activation of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), whereas female compared with male non‐CUs displayed lower WM‐related MFG activation. Additionally, WM‐related activation of the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, and putamen was negatively associated with cocaine use severity in female but not male CUs. These data support the hypothesis of sex‐dependent PFC differences in CUs and speculatively suggest that PFC deficits may be more strongly implicated in the development, continuation, and possibly treatment of CUD in females. Most importantly, the current data stress the importance of studying both males and females in psychiatry research as not doing so could greatly bias our knowledge of CUD and other psychiatric disorders. 
  
Regular cocaine users display sex‐dependent differences in working memory‐related prefrontal recruitment, compared with nondrug using controls. These findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex is involved in the etiology of substance use disorders in a sex‐dependent matter.

## INTRODUCTION 
  
Cocaine is one of the most commonly used illicit drugs in Europe, and the prevalence of use has increased in the past decade.  Although the prevalence of cocaine use is 2–3 times higher in men than in women, this gap is slowly closing.  Although women start using cocaine at a later age, they are suggested to progress more rapidly to compulsive use and have higher relapse rates compared with men.  A better understanding of the role of sex in the (neuro)pathology of cocaine use disorder (CUD) could pave the way for the development of sex‐tailored treatment strategies. 

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in cognitive control and emotion regulation, and compromised PFC functioning is thought to promote the shift from recreational to compulsive drug use.  The few studies that investigated the role of sex in CUDs showed lower dorsomedial and ventromedial PFC activity in female compared with male cocaine users (CUs) during cocaine cue imagery  and in response to negative emotional  and drug‐salient stimuli.  In contrast, female CUs also showed higher dorsomedial PFC activity in response to negative emotional stimuli.  Moreover, pharmacological enhancement of PFC functioning (using the noradrenergic α2‐receptors agonist guanfacine) mitigated stress‐induced arousal and craving ,   and improved cognitive control  in CUD females, but not males. These studies suggest that PFC functioning is specifically impaired in females with a CUD in the context of emotionally salient stimuli, but it remains to be tested if these results generalize to cognitive control‐related processes. 

Working memory (WM) refers to the ability to temporarily maintain, update, or manipulate information in an active state and is crucially involved in cognitive control. ,   WM performance is generally associated with activation of a network of various PFC and parietal brain areas, with increased WM load being associated with increased activation.  In various psychiatric disorders, stronger WM‐related (high WM load > low WM load) PFC activation (compared with a control population) is suggested to reflect compensatory but inefficient neural information processing, leading to deficits in WM performance. 

WM tasks generally require sustained attention, information storage, memory for temporal order as well as the updating and manipulation of information. ,   As such, WM‐related differences in neural activation in CUD populations may reflect differences in any of these functions. Neuroimaging research demonstrated WM‐related PFC deficits in CUD, although both higher WM‐related PFC activation (middle frontal gyrus [MFG])  and lower PFC activation (cingulate gyrus, middle, superior, and inferior frontal gyrus)  have been reported. Research in other substance use disorders (SUDs) reported similar mixed findings, including WM‐related (dorsomedial) PFC overrecruitment in alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients  and cannabis users.  Moreover, higher WM‐related (dorsolateral) PFC activity has been reported to predict cannabis use. ,  ,   In contrast, lower WM‐related PFC activation (middle and superior frontal gyrus, precentral and postcentral gyrus) has also been demonstrated in AUD patients, ,   with lower WM‐related activation of the rostral PFC and ventrolateral PFC predicting relapse to alcohol use. 

A possible explanation of previous conflicting findings could be that the majority of these studies did not account for sex differences. Although most neuroimaging WM meta‐analyses in nonsubstance using populations did not include sex in their analyses, a 2014 meta‐analysis demonstrated higher WM‐related limbic and (middle and medial) PFC activity in females but higher WM‐related parietal activity in males.  As such, omitting sex from the analyses could greatly obscure the interpretation of WM‐related neural deficits in psychiatric disorders, including CUD. 

To date, only one study reported on sex differences in WM‐related PFC activation in CUD.  Although this study did not demonstrate any significant group (CUD vs. controls) by sex interaction effects on WM‐related PFC activation, this was likely due to insufficient statistical power (i.e., inclusion of three female vs. 16 male CUD patients). Based on the earlier described findings of lower dmPFC activation during the processing of emotionally salient stimuli in female compared with male CUD patients, ,  ,   and the finding that pharmacological enhancement of PFC functioning improved cognitive control while reducing arousal and craving in female CUD patients only, ,  ,  ,   sex‐dependent differences in WM‐related PFC activation can be expected as well. 

The main aim of this study was to explore sex‐dependent differences in WM‐related PFC activation in a relatively large sample of regular CUs (27 males and 28 females) and non‐cocaine users (non‐CU: 26 males and 28 females) using a standardized WM paradigm (the n‐back task ). It was hypothesized that (i) CUs would show higher WM‐related (2‐back > 0‐back; 2‐back > 1‐back) PFC activation compared with non‐CUs, (ii) females would show higher WM‐related PFC activation compared with males, and (iii) WM‐related PFC activation would be highest in female CUs, reflecting inefficient WM‐related processes. Of note, because of the mixed and limited previous findings, the direction of these hypothesized effects is highly speculative. 


## METHODS AND MATERIALS 
  
### Participants 
  
This study is part of a large project designed to investigate the role of sex in the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying CUD. Fifty‐four regular CUs and 54 matched non‐CUs who conducted the n‐back functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task were included in this study. All participants were between 18 and 45 years of age and free from any MRI contraindications. CUs used cocaine (intranasally) at least four times a month in the past 6 months (CUs). Non‐CUs were excluded if they smoked regularly (at least once per week), had an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)  score > 12, used cocaine more than five times in their life, or used illicit substances more than five times in the past 6 months. All participants provided informed consent and received a monetary compensation. This study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of Amsterdam (ERB number: 2019‐DP‐9964). 


### Assessment of substance use and psychological functioning 
  
Severity of depressive symptoms was assed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI‐II ), state and trait anxiety was assessed using the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI ), attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) symptom severity was measured using the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD‐RS ), and impulsivity was assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS‐11 ) in all participants. The following characteristics of substance use were assessed in CUs only: severity of cocaine use and related problems in the past 12 months was assessed using the Drug Use Disorder Identification Test for cocaine (DUDIT ), cocaine use (grams and days per month) in the 28 days prior to study participation was assessed using the Time Line Follow‐Back procedure,  and onset age of regular use was assessed using an in‐house questionnaire. Moreover, motivation to change cocaine use was assessed using the Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RCQ ), smoking behavior (number of smoking days per week and cigarettes per day) was assessed using an in‐house questionnaire, severity of cannabis use was assessed using the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test‐Revised.  Current DSM‐5 symptoms for CUD, and cannabis use disorder and AUD were assessed using a self‐reported questionnaire based on the SCID. 


### Procedures 
  
Participants were recruited through social media and local advertisements in the Amsterdam area, the Netherlands. After signing informed consent, participants were screened on inclusion and exclusion criteria. On the day of testing, participants first completed the questionnaires, after which the MRI scan was made. Participants were instructed to abstain from any drug use in the 24‐h preceding the MRI scan. 


### The   n  ‐back task 
  
The n‐back task  consisted of alternating blocks with three load levels: 0‐back, 1‐back, and 2‐back. During each block, participants viewed a series of 15 letters in sequence, including five targets. Blocks lasted 30 s (each stimulus lasted 2 s), and the interblock interval was 5 s, during which the block instructions were repeated. In 0‐back blocks, participants were instructed to indicate when the target letter “X” appeared on the screen. In 1‐back blocks, participants had to decide if the letter on the screen was identical to the previous one. In 2‐back blocks, targets were those letters identical to the letter presented two trials back. Participants were instructed to press a right response box button for targets (right index finger) and a left button for nontargets (left index finger). No additional speed or accuracy instructions were given. Each load level was repeated four times resulting in a 7‐min task of 12 blocks. Prior to scanning, all participants first completed a practice block of the n‐back task outside of the scanner. 


### fMRI acquisition and preprocessing 
  
A 3.0‐Tesla Philips Achieva scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) with a 32‐channel head coil was used for data acquisition. A T1‐3D anatomical scan was acquired (TR/TE 8.2/3.8; matrix 240 × 240; 1 × 1 × 1 mm  voxel; transversal slices, 8° flip angle) for anatomical reference. Echo planar images (EPIs) were recorded during the n‐back task, with 36 ascending axial slices (1 × 1 × 1 mm  voxel size; slice gap 3 mm; TR/TE 1.999/28 ms; matrix 80 × 80, 80° flip angle). 

Data were preprocessed using fMRIPrep 1.3.2 : the anatomical scans were corrected for intensity nonuniformity, skull‐stripped, spatially normalized, and segmented into cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and gray matter. The functional data were corrected for susceptibility distortions using a deformation field and subsequently coregistered, motion corrected, and smoothed. ICA‐AROMA  was used to automatically remove motion artifacts, and data were resampled to standard space. Further details on the pre‐processing pipeline can be found in the  . 

fMRI data were further analyzed using SPM12 ( ). First level models included separate regressors for the 0‐back, 1‐back, and 2‐back blocks. These regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. A high pass filter (1/128 Hz) was included in the first‐level model to correct for low‐frequency signal drift. The contrasts for the 0‐back, 1‐back, and 2‐back blocks were subsequently entered in a second level model to test for the main and interaction effects of sex, group, and n‐back load. 


### Statistical analyses 
  
Demographics, scores on (clinical) questionnaires, and n‐back behavioral performance were compared between groups with standard univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS for Windows (v.26.0). Differences between groups and sexes in age, alcohol use severity (AUDIT), depressive symptoms (BDI), state and trait anxiety (STAI), impulsivity (BIS‐11), and ADHD symptom severity (ADHD‐RS) were assessed using 2 × 2 ANOVAs, testing both main and interaction effects. One‐way ANOVAs were subsequently used to test sex differences within the CU group in cocaine use (grams per month and days per month), cocaine use severity (DUDIT), onset age of regular cocaine use, and cannabis use severity (CUDIT). Chi‐square tests were additionally used to test for sex differences in the severity of cocaine, alcohol, and cannabis use disorder (mild, moderate, or severe according to the DSM‐5 criteria), the prevalence of smoking (percent weekly smokers and percent daily smokers), and motivation to change cocaine use. Sex and group differences in n‐back performance were assessed in terms of mean reaction time of correct responses and accuracy (proportion correct), using repeated measures ANOVAs. 

To test for main and interaction effects of group, sex, and n‐back load (2‐back > 0‐back and 2‐back > 1‐back), a whole‐brain analysis was performed, with mean framewise displacement (FD) values for each subject as covariate of noninterest to account for potential motion effect. Whole brain analyses were family‐wise error (FWE) rate corrected on cluster level (  p   < 0.05), with an initial height threshold on the voxel level of   p   < 0.001. This analysis was repeated to test whether significant effects were still present after correcting for potential confounding variables. Variables were treated as confounders when there was a significant interaction effect between group and sex on these variables. This was tested for age, education, AUDIT, BDI, ADHD‐RS, STAI, and BIS. When a significant whole brain interaction effect was found, the nature of this interaction was explored by performing pairwise comparisons (between sexes within groups and between groups within sexes) using a small volume correction where the mask of the significant cluster served as a the small volume. Additionally, the Marsbar toolbox ( ) was used to extract the mean activity of the significant cluster(s) visualization purposes. 

A second whole brain analysis was performed within the CU group only, with cocaine use (grams per month), cocaine use severity (DUDIT‐scores), as well as its interaction with sex as regressors of interest, correcting for variations in FD, to test whether cocaine use and cocaine use severity were associated with WM‐related (2‐back > 0‐back; 2‐back > 1‐back) brain activity in a sex‐dependent matter. This analysis was repeated to test whether significant effects were still present after correcting for potential confounding variables. 



## RESULTS 
  
### Demographic and clinical characteristics 
  
On average, male and female CUs started using cocaine regularly at the age of 23.5 and 21.4 and used 5.5 and 3.8 g of cocaine per month, on 7.4 and 4.9 days, respectively. Most CUs met the DSM‐5 criteria for CUD (males: 85%, females: 89%). Based on the RCQ, the majority of CUs was actively trying to change cocaine intake (males: 59%, females: 63%), although only 3% of the participants reported to have (had) professional help for reducing their cocaine use. Two thirds of all CUs met the DSM‐5 criteria for AUD (males: 85%, females: 59%), whereas less than one third of the CUs met the DSM‐5 criteria for cannabis use disorder (males: 30%, females: 15%). There were no sex differences in the amount of cocaine used per month, readiness to change cocaine use, tobacco use, the prevalence of a DSM‐5 diagnosis for CUD, cannabis use disorder or AUD, cocaine use severity (DUDIT), alcohol use severity (AUDIT), or cannabis use severity (CUDIT‐R). The only significant sex difference was that CU females reported to use cocaine on fewer days per month compared with CU males. Therefore, days of cocaine use per month was treated as a confounder in an exploratory within‐group fMRI analysis. See Table   for detailed substance use characteristics and statistics. 
  
Substance use characteristics in male and female cocaine users 
    
CUs and non‐CUs had similar age, educational level, and trait anxiety scores, but CUs had significantly higher AUDIT, state anxiety, impulsivity (BIS attention and BIS planning), and ADHD‐RS (childhood and past 6 month) scores. Additionally, females had significant higher state anxiety scores compared with males, whereas males reported higher childhood ADHD‐RS than females. There was a significant group by sex interaction effect on depressive symptoms (BDI scores), impulsivity (BIS total and motor subscale), and ADHD‐RS scores in the past 6 months. Follow‐up tests revealed that although both male CUs and female CUs scored higher on these variables compared with non‐CU male and non‐CU females, female CUs had significant higher BDI, BIS total and BIS motor scores compared with male CUs, while no such sex differences were present within non‐CUs. Because of these differences, BDI, BIS motor, BIS total, and adult ADHD‐RS scores were treated as confounders in the fMRI analyses. See Table   for all values and statistics.

### Behavioral results n‐back task 
  
There were no significant differences between groups or sexes in n‐back performance. There was a significant main effect of n‐back load (  F   = 182.11,   p   < 0.001) on reaction times, with reaction times increasing with increasing n‐back load. The other main or interaction effects were not significant. There was a significant main effect of n‐back load (  F   = 103.47,   p   < 0.001) on accuracy, with accuracy decreasing with increasing n‐back load. The other main and interaction effects were nonsignificant. See Figure  . See the   for a sensitivity analysis on how large the effect size needs to be to demonstrate significant main and interaction effects of group and sex.

### fMRI results n‐back task 
  
#### Main task effect 
  
The main task effects were as expected, with strong WM‐related (2‐back > 0‐back and 2‐back > 1‐back) activation of fronto‐parietal areas and deactivation of the default mode network (Figure   and Table  ).

The error bars represent the 90% confidence interval. CU, cocaine user; WM, working memory 
  

#### WM‐load, group and sex interaction effects 
  
WM‐related brain activation (2‐back > 0‐back or 2‐back > 1‐back) did not differ between groups or sexes. For the 2‐back > 0‐back contrast, there was a significant group by sex interaction in the left dorsal MFG (dMFG). See Table   and Figure  . Pairwise comparisons on this specific cluster demonstrated that the non‐CU males had higher WM‐related activation in this region than non‐CU females (  p   = 0.002), although no such difference was between CU males and females. In addition, within non‐CU males displayed higher WM‐related activation in this region compared to CU males (  p   = 0.006), whereas CU females displayed higher activation in this region compared to non‐CU females (  p   = 0.002). Adding BDI, BIS‐total, BIS‐motor, and ADHD symptom severity scores as regressors of noninterest in the whole brain analysis did not alter the outcomes of these analyses (results not reported). There was no significant group by sex interaction effect for the 2‐back > 1‐back contrast. 
  
Main and interaction effects of group and sex on working memory‐related whole brain activation 
    
An exploratory regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between WM‐related (2‐back > 0‐back) dMFG activation and cocaine use severity, grams of cocaine use per month, and days of cocaine use per month in the CU group only. This analysis (with FD and sex included as covariates) demonstrated that none of these variables were significantly associated with WM‐related dMFG activation (DUDIT:   B   = −0.15,   t   = −0.97,   p   = 0.34; days/month:   B   = −0.46,   t   = −1.99,   p   = 0.051; grams/month:   B   = −0.04,   t   = −0.26,   p   = 0.80). 


#### Within CU group whole brain regression analyses 
  
Whole brain regression analyses with cocaine use (grams of cocaine per month) and cocaine use severity (DUDIT scores) in the CU group demonstrated that cocaine use was negatively associated with WM‐related activation of the vermis (2‐back > 0‐back) and right calcarine sulcus/bilateral cuneus (2‐back > 0‐back and 2‐back > 1‐back). Cocaine use was positively associated with WM‐related activation of the left cerebellum (2‐back > 0‐back and 2‐back > 1‐back) and lingual gyrus and vermis (2‐back > 1‐back). The association between cocaine use and WM‐related activation of the cerebellum, vermis, and occipital cortex was significantly moderated by sex: the association was positive in males but negative in females. In addition, although cocaine use was not associated with any WM‐related brain activation, the association between cocaine use severity and WM‐related (2‐back > 1‐back) activation in the left insula, inferior frontal gyrus, the cerebellum, and vermis was also moderated by sex, with a negative association in females, but not in males. Adding days of cocaine use per month as confounder to the model did not change the outcome of these results. See Table 4 and Figure  . 
  
Working memory load‐related activation (2‐back > 1‐back) of the insula, putamen, and inferior frontal gyrus (in red) is negatively associated with drug use severity in cocaine using women but not in in cocaine using men. Nonetheless, the brain activation patterns are in the similar range as non‐cocaine using controls. Mean activity of the whole cluster is extracted and plotted for visualization purposes. The error bars represent the 90% confidence interval. CU, cocaine user 
  



## DISCUSSION 
  
Women have been structurally ignored in addiction‐related (neuroimaging) research, and therefore, little is known about sex differences in the neuropathology of addiction. The aim of this explorative study was to investigated sex differences in WM‐related PFC functioning in regular CUs, as deficits in PFC‐mediated cognitive control are crucially involved in the transition from recreational to compulsive cocaine use.  WM‐related (2‐back > 0‐back; 2‐back > 1‐back) PFC activity was hypothesized to be higher in CUs compared with non‐CUs, with larger differences in female compare with male CUs. There was no main effect of group or sex on brain activity or behavior; however, we did observe a significant group by sex interaction effect in WM‐related (2‐back > 0‐back) left dMFG activation: CU females displayed higher dMFG activity compared with non‐CU females, whereas CU males displayed lower dMFG activity compared with non‐CU males. Furthermore, WM‐related activation of the vlPFC (including the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, and putamen) was negatively associated with cocaine use severity in female CUs, but not in males. Heightened WM‐related PFC activation is suggested to reflect compensatory but inefficient information processing, leading to WM deficits.  As such, the current data support our hypothesis that PFC deficits are more strongly implicated in the neuropathology of CUD in females compared with males. Importantly, these findings highlight an urgent need to further unravel the role of sex in the mechanisms underlying CUD. 

Although heightened WM‐related PFC activation in CUD (compared with a control group) may reflect compensatory (but inefficient) mechanisms, ,   heightened PFC activation in recreative CUs (in the absence of behavioral deficits) has also been suggested to reflect resilience to stimulant dependence. In line with this, heightened WM‐related activation of the ventrolateral and ventromedial PFC has been shown to protect against relapse in alcohol dependent patients.  In the current study, inferior frontal gyrus activity was negatively associated with cocaine use severity in female CUs only, perhaps reflecting sex‐dependent resilience against the development of compulsive cocaine use. It should be noted, though, that the majority of CUs included in our study already transitioned from recreational to compulsive cocaine use. Alternatively, although WM‐related dMFG activation was unrelated to cocaine use (severity), the negative association between cocaine use severity and WM‐related ventrolateral PFC recruitment may reflect a sex‐specific (neurotoxic) effect of cocaine use on the brain, supporting the hypothesis that females are more vulnerable to the (neurotoxic) effects of substances, including cocaine and alcohol. 

Unexpectedly, dMFG activation was higher in non‐CU males compared with non‐CU females. This is remarkable, as females generally display higher WM‐related middle and medial PFC activity compared with males.  Interestingly, although various PFC regions are shown to be more active in females compared with males during WM‐related tasks,  there seems to be a sex‐dependent effect on the lateralization of WM‐related dMFG activity as well: higher WM‐related activation of the   right   MFG was found in females compared with males, whereas higher WM‐related activation of the   left   MFG was found in males,  which is in line with our finding in non‐CUs. Sex differences in WM‐related brain functioning and lateralization are suggested to result from a combination of prenatal hormonal (testosterone) exposure  and gender‐related factors later in life.  Consequently, the current findings may be the result of neurodevelopmental differences, reflecting a sex‐dependent predisposition to CUD rather than a consequence of cocaine use. 

It is important to note that no significant group or sex differences were found in behavioral n‐back performance. However, the n‐back task is generally considered to be less reliable to assess behavioral WM‐related deficits.  As such, the behavioral implications of the current findings remain speculative and future research may benefit from including a more reliable WM task outside the MRI scanner to assess behavioral WM performance. 

Although the causal interplay between PFC functioning, CUD and sex can only be established with future longitudinal research, the current findings suggest that PFC deficits are more strongly implicated in the development, continuation, and perhaps also treatment of CUD in women. Because pharmacological enhancement of PFC control (using the noradrenergic α2‐receptors agonist guanfacine)  reduced arousal and craving and improved cognitive control in women with a CUD specifically, ,  ,   women with a CUD may benefit more from interventions targeted at improving PFC‐related cognitive and emotional control processes. 

Inconsistent results from previous SUD studies ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   may be explained by highly variable but mainly low numbers of female participants. An important strength of the current study is that it was specifically set‐up to elucidate sex differences in PFC functioning in regular CUs and non‐CUs. As such, CU males and females were matched on most cocaine‐use‐related variables. Although we focused on including nontreatment seeking CUs, the majority of all included CUs met the DSM‐5 criteria of CUD and were actively trying to change their cocaine use based on the readiness to change questionnaire. Therefore, the current findings likely generalize to treatment seeking CUs as well. 

A limitation of the current study is that we only tested for sex differences without taking gender taking into account. According to the Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines, gender is an equally important determinant of health and well‐being as sex.  Although the terms sex and gender are often confused in scientific literature, gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors, and identities of female, male, and gender‐diverse people, whereas sex refers to a set of biological attributes in humans and animals that are associated with physiological features. Future research should take gender as a potential moderating factor in the (neuro)pathology of addiction into account, for example, by calculating a gender index based on a variety of psychosocial gender‐related variables.  Moreover, CUD is generally associated with polysubstance use. Indeed, approximately two thirds of CUs met the DSM‐5 criteria of an AUD and almost one third met the DMS‐5 criteria of a cannabis use disorder. Although there were no sex differences in the prevalence of comorbid SUDs, we have previously demonstrated that deficits in PFC structure are strongly associated with the amount of polysubstance use across regular CUs.  Hence, we cannot fully exclude potential confounding effects of other substances on PFC functioning in the current study. In this study, we instructed CUs to remain abstinent for 24 h prior to study participation. We decided to not perform a urine screening to check this as cocaine metabolites can be detected in urine up to 6 days after the last use in regular CUs,  which is much longer than its psychopharmacological effects. A urine test would, therefore, not have been a very accurate measure of intoxication in this specific population. Instead, we used the time‐line follow‐back procedure to assess cocaine (and other substance) use prior to the experiment, which is generally considered to be a highly reliable method to asses information about substance use, including cocaine use, in both treatment and nontreatment seeking populations.  Nonetheless, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that some CUs were (still) under the influence of some substances. 

In conclusion, the current study provides important first evidence for sex‐dependent differences in WM‐related PFC recruitment among regular CUs. Although speculative, these data suggest that PFC deficits are more strongly implicated in the development, continuation, and possibly treatment of CUD in females compared with males. Most importantly, the current findings highlight the crucial need for (i) including both males and females in (pre)clinical addiction research and (ii) disaggregating (neuroimaging) findings for males and females separately.  Doing so will not only lead to a better understanding of (sex differences in) the (neuro)pathology of addiction but could also pave the way for the development of sex‐tailored treatment of SUDs.

# Abstract
 
 Objective:   Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a kind of motor disorder, and the striatum plays a significant role in motor function. The purpose of this study was to explore the alterations of the cortical-striatal network in HFS using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 

 Methods:   The fMRI data of 30 adult patients with primary unilateral HFS (15 left-side and 15 right-side) and 30 healthy controls were collected. Six subregions of the striatum in each hemisphere were selected for functional connectivity (FC) analysis. One-sample   t-  test was used to analyze the intragroup FC of the HFS group and the control group. Two-sample   t  -test was used to compare the difference of FC between the two groups. The correlation between the abnormal FC and severity of HFS was evaluated by using the Spearman correlation analysis. 

 Results:   Compared with the controls, the striatal subregions had altered FC with motor and orbitofrontal cortex in patients with HFS. The altered FC between striatal subregions and motor cortex was correlated with the spasm severity in patients with HFS. 

 Conclusion:   The FC of the cortical-striatal network was altered in primary HFS, and these alterations were correlated with the severity of HFS. This study indicated that the cortical-striatal network may play different roles in the underlying pathological mechanism of HFS.

## Introduction 
  
Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a syndrome of involuntary contraction of facial muscles innervated by ipsilateral facial nerves ( ), which can gradually affect facial expressive muscles and platysma muscles ( ). Primary HFS is believed to be caused by vascular compression of the facial nerve at its root exit zone ( ), but the central mechanism is still not clear. Studies have found that depression and anxiety are more common in patients with HFS ( ;  ). Striatum plays a prominent role in modulating motor activity and higher cognitive function ( ). However, the exact neural mechanism of the striatum in the regulation of motor in patients with HFS still remains unexplored. Early identification of functional changes in the cortical-striatal loop of patients with HFS can help to understand disease pathogenesis and achieve early diagnosis as well as effective treatments. This study was aimed to investigate the altered cortical-striatal network in patients with primary HFS, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 

As part of the extrapyramidal system, the striatum is integral to the motor, cognitive, and emotion regulation functions ( ). The subregions of the striatum, such as putamen, caudate, and ventral striatum, also are associated with different brain functions. Previous anatomical and neuroimaging studies of the striatum have shown that the putamen mainly receives projections from the sensorimotor cortex, and the caudate receives projections from the associated cortex, while the ventral striatum receives projections from the medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and limbic system ( ;  ;  ). 

Based on these facts, striatum would be able to exhibit profound influences in motor disorders. For example, as one part of the striatum, putamen can regulate the amplitude and velocity of muscle contraction   via   the cortical-striatal loop and the dopamine system, and therefore plays a significant role in some motor disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease ( ;  ). The abnormal functional connectivity (FC) between the striatum and the motor cortex was also found in patients with motor disorders ( ;  ;  ). In Parkinson’s disease, after the substantia nigra degeneration, the content of dopamine in the striatum is also decreased ( ), and in addition to the abnormal striatum-substantia nigra loop, the cortex-striatum loop may also be abnormal ( ). These results further highlight the significance of the striatum in the development of motor disorders. Besides, the researchers have used FC analysis to study the function of striatal subregions in healthy people ( ), patients with Parkinson’s disease ( ;  ), depression ( ;  ), autism ( ), and obsessive-compulsive disorder ( ), and the mechanisms of central alterations in different subregions of the striatum have been revealed. 

Current resting-state fMRI studies of HFS are limited, and the results are diverse. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) index has been used in most previous studies to indicate time-domain coherence between neighboring voxels in the brain. Researchers have found ReHo abnormalities in the motor cortex, frontal lobes, and cerebellum in patients with HFS ( ;  ;  ), and no ReHo alterations in the striatum, probably due to the small sample size and the different meanings between the analysis indexes, i.e., ReHo and FC. However, one study reported that patients after infarction of the caudate, one of the subregions of the striatum, presented with HFS, suggesting that the striatum may play an important role in the development of HFS ( ). In addition, another study on facial nerve palsy found altered FC between the striatum and motor cortex after facial muscle paralysis, further affirming the relationship between the striatum and facial muscle movement ( ). To the best of our knowledge, there are few earlier studies on HFS using the FC analysis method. One study showed abnormalities in FC between the thalamus and parietal cortex in patients with HFS ( ), but it did not explore the central changes of the striatum in this dyskinesia. HFS is a kind of facial movement disorder, it is not clear that how the striatum regulates the motor function of patients with HFS before and after the onset of its symptoms, and in this study, we focused on striatal function in patients with HFS. 

In this study, we performed FC analysis of 12 striatal subregions in patients with HFS. We hypothesized that in patients with chronic primary HFS, the FC between the striatum and motor cortex and FC between striatal subregions will be changed. Since long-term HFS may result in psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety ( ), we also hypothesized that the FC between the striatum subregions and the emotion-related cortex will be altered in patients with HFS. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between altered FC and clinical characteristics in patients with HFS. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Subjects 
  
A total of 60 subjects were selected from a total of 64 participants, and 4 subjects (3 patients with HFS and 1 healthy control) were excluded from the analysis due to excessive head motion (translational movement > 2 mm or rotation > 2°). Then, 30 patients with HFS (15 left-side HFS, 15 right-side HFS, 12 men, 18 women, age 48.87 ± 10.61 years) were enrolled from 2017 to 2019 in the Department of Neurosurgery, China-Japan Friendship Hospital. HFS was diagnosed by two experienced neurologists based on clinical symptoms and history. The severity of HFS was assessed using the Cohen spasm scale (0–4 scores, with higher scores indicating more severe spasm) ( ). The inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: (1) adult patients with primary unilateral HFS, (2) without craniocerebral lesions and mental disorders, no use of psychotropic drugs, and (3) being right-handed. The exclusion criteria for patients were as follows: (1) with bilateral HFS, (2) having contraindications to MRI examination, and (3) with excessive head motion. Notably, 30 age-, sex-, education-matched healthy controls (12 men, 18 women, age 47.63 ± 13.29 years) were recruited from the society. The inclusion criteria for healthy controls are as follows: (1) aged 18 years old or above, (2) absence of neurological and mental disorders, and (3) being right-handed. The demographic and clinical characteristics of participants are shown in  . This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital, and all subjects have given informed consent before the experiment.

### Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Acquisition 
  
The experiment was carried out on the 3.0 T MRI scanner (GE, Discovery MR750, Milwaukee, United States) with an 8-channel phased-array head coil. The resting-state fMRI with a single-shot gradient recalled echo-planar imaging sequence was performed with the following recipe. The repetition time (TR) was 2,000 ms, while the echo time (TE) was set to 30 ms. The slice thickness was chosen to be 3.5 mm with a spacing of 0.7 mm. The matrix of the image was 64 × 64, while the field of view (FOV) was 224 mm × 224 mm. The flip angle was 90°, and the number of excitations (NEX) was set to 1. A total of 8 min were consumed for each data with 34 slices and 240 time points. T2WI scan was used to exclude the cerebral organic lesions. 3D T1WI anatomic images were reconstructed using three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo sequences (3D FSPGR), and the TR of which was 6.7 ms, while the TE was set to minimum full. The matrix was changed to 256 × 256 with a FOV of 256 mm × 256 mm. Furthermore, the slice thickness was chosen as 1.0 mm, while the NEX remained to be 1. 


### Data Preprocessing 
  
To unify the affected side of the patients, the T1WI and fMRI data with left HFS (15 cases) and matched controls (15 cases) were flipped from left to right before preprocessing ( ). In this study, “right” was defined as the ipsilateral side, and “left” was defined as the contralateral side for the flipped data. The preprocessing was conducted using the software of Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) ( ) in the following steps. First, the DICOM data were converted to NIFTI format and the first 10 time points for each file were removed. Second, the timing correction and realignment were carried out, the T1WI to the mean functional image was co-registered, and the DARTEL tool to compute transformations from individual native space to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space was used ( ). The subjects with head motion exceeding 2 mm or 2° were excluded. Then, the spatial smoothing using a 4-mm Gaussian kernel was performed and the low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise using band-pass filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz) were removed. Finally, the Friston 24-parameter model was used to regress out head motion effects. In this step, the white matter signal, cerebrospinal fluid signal, and global signal were regressed as covariates. 


### Definition of the Region of Interest 
  
The regions of interest (ROIs) were determined by the “Define ROI” module using DPARSF software, based on the radius and MNI spatial coordinates. According to the previous study, six striatal subregions of each hemisphere were selected as ROIs, and the radius of each ROI was set to 3 mm. The MNI coordinates of the ROIs were as follows: dorsal caudal putamen (DCP, ± 28, 1, 3), dorsal rostral putamen (DRP, ± 25, 8, 6), ventral rostral putamen (VRP, ± 20, 12, − 3), dorsal caudate (DC, ± 13, 15, 9), inferior ventral striatum (VSi, ± 9, 9, −8), and superior ventral striatum (VSs, ± 10, 15, 0) ( ). The diagram of ROIs is shown in  .

### Analysis of Functional Connectivity Based on Voxel-Wise 
  
First, the time course of the average BOLD signal was extracted from each ROI. Then, the Pearson’s correlation between the time course of each ROI and the time course of all other voxels in the brain was calculated. Fisher   z   transformation was performed to improve the normal distribution of the data. Then, the correlation map, that is, the FC map of the whole brain was generated for further statistical analysis. 

#### Intragroup Functional Connectivity Analysis 
  
To explore the intragroup FC patterns of the cortical-striatal network, one-sample   t-  tests (default mask) were performed in the HFS group and the HC group. The statistical threshold was set at   z   > 3.6594 and cluster size of >6 mm , which corresponded to a corrected   P   < 0.001. This correction threshold was determined using Monte Carlo simulations with the program AlphaSim in AFNI ( ). 


#### Between-Group Functional Connectivity Analysis 
  
To determine the FC differences of the cortical-striatal network between the two groups, two-sample   t  -tests were performed at each FC map of 12 ROIs (default mask). The Gaussian random field (GRF) method was used for multiple comparison corrections, and the statistical threshold was set at voxel-level   P   < 0.005 and cluster-level   P   < 0.05. The DPABI software was used to perform the statistical analysis of FC. 


#### Correlation Analysis 
  
The   z   value of brain regions with significant changes in the HFS group was extracted to explore the relationship between the severity of HFS and altered connectivity. Then, the Spearman correlation analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software to evaluate the correlation between abnormal FC and spasm severity in patients with HFS. The age, sex, education, and duration were regressed as covariates. We also explored the relationship between duration and spasm severity through Spearman correlation analysis, and the age, sex, and education level were regressed as covariates as well. A total of 14 correlations were performed, with 13 abnormal FCs correlating with spasm severity, and, finally, 1 correlation was performed between spasm severity and disease duration. The false discovery rate (FDR) method was used to correct the results of the correlation analysis for multiple comparisons. 



### Analysis of Functional Connectivity Based on Regions of Interest-Wise 
  
The FC between the striatal ROIs was also calculated. After Fisher   z   transformation, a 12 × 12 FC matrix was generated for every subject. A total of 66   z   values were constructed, and each   z   value stands for the FC between two brain regions. Two-sample   t  -tests were performed using SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States) to compare the difference of FC between the HFS group and the HC group. Age, gender, and education were regressed as covariates. FDR correction was used to control false positives for multiple comparisons, and the statistical threshold was set at   P   < 0.05.

### Intragroup Functional Connectivity in the Cortical-Striatal Network 
  
The intragroup FC maps of the cortical-striatal network were similar in the HC and HFS groups, which is consistent with previous studies ( ;  ;  ). The putamen ROIs had strengthened connectivity with the insula, middle cingulate cortex (MCC), precuneus, and supplementary motor area (SMA) ( ). The DC ROIs had strengthened connectivity with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG). The ventral striatum ROIs had strengthened connectivity with ACC and OFC ( ). In this study, these intragroup maps were merely for visualizing FC in the two groups.

## Discussion 
  
This study investigated the functional alterations of the cortical-striatal network in patients with HFS and their relationship with clinical manifestations. Compared with the controls, the striatal subregions had altered FC with motor and OFC in patients with HFS. Furthermore, the FC between the ventral striatum and motor cortex was positively associated with the severity of HFS. Finally, our results suggest that the cortical-striatal network may play differential roles in the underlying pathological mechanism of HFS. 

### Increased Functional Connectivity of the Cortical-Striatal Network in Patients With Hemifacial Spasm 
  
As we know, this is the first resting-state fMRI study to examine intrinsic cortical-striatal connectivity in HFS. The emotion-related cortex showed significantly increased FC with the ventral striatum and putamen, in patients with HFS compared with the controls. The orbitofrontal lobe and the VSi are involved in emotional activities ( ;  ). The structural and functional abnormalities of those regions were found to be widespread in patients with depression ( ;  ;  ;  ). Long-term HFS may lead to anxiety and depression ( ). The increased connectivity between the VSi and orbitofrontal lobe may be associated with the poor mental status of patients with HFS. The SOG was located in the visual network, and studies have found that this area was involved in facial expression and emotion processing ( ). We speculated that the increased functional activity of these regions in patients with HFS may be related to abnormal facial expressions. In addition, the putamen had increased FC with MFG and SFG, which may be associated with the depression and other adverse emotions of the patients with HFS, and it is consistent with previous studies in patients with depression ( ). In summary, the ventral striatum was mainly involved in emotional activities, while the putamen may also involve in emotional activities in addition to motor function. 


### Decreased Functional Connectivity of the Cortical-Striatal Network in Patients With Hemifacial Spasm 
  
We also found that the FC between the putamen and the ipsilateral motor cortex was decreased in the HFS group, and so does the FC between the caudate and the cerebellum. It was known that the precentral gyrus was the first somatic motor area, and the SFG was the premotor area. One side of the cerebral motor area dominates the contralateral body movement, but the muscles involved in associated movement are dominated by bilateral motor areas, such as extraocular muscles and masticatory muscles ( ). The decrease of FC between the putamen and ipsilateral motor area may be a compensatory mechanism to inhibit facial muscle spasms. In addition, the cerebellum is an important motor regulation center. The cerebellum may be involved in the processing of movement, cognition, and emotion by forming loops with the brain, and structural or functional abnormalities in these loops may contribute to the development of motor disorders (e.g., ataxia) ( ). Abnormalities in the connectivity between brain regions within the loops can lead to disorders that are associated with loop dysfunction. The cerebellum may form a loop with the cortical-caudate, which is involved in the motor regulation of HFS, and the diminished connectivity may be a consequence of the dysfunction of the caudate-cerebellar loop. To sum up, in addition to the putamen, other parts of the striatum, such as the caudate, may be involved in the pathological process of HFS. Different cortical-striatal loops may be involved in motion monitoring, error detection, and correction ( ). 


### Increased Functional Connectivity Within the Striatal Network in Patients With Hemifacial Spasm (Uncorrected,   P   < 0.05) 
  
In this study, we found no significant differences in FC within the striatal network between the two groups (FDR correction, threshold   P   < 0.05). However, using a less conservative threshold (  P   < 0.05), we found that the FC between the putamen ROIs was increased in patients with HFS compared with the controls. Interestingly, a study of the striatal network in facial palsy found the decreased FC between the putamen and the ventral striatum (uncorrected) ( ), which is the opposite of our results. We know that facial palsy and facial spasm are two motor disorders with opposite manifestations, the former shows reduced or no movement of the affected facial muscles and the latter shows excessive movement. In addition, the connectivity within the striatal network is also consistent with clinical manifestations, i.e., being diminished in facial palsy and increased in facial spasm. Therefore, we speculated that the putamen plays an important role in the motor function of facial muscles, and the increased or decreased FC between the putamen and other seeds within the striatum may respond to the increased or decreased motor signals in this neural circuit, thus resulting in different motor states of the facial muscles. 


### Limitations 
  
There were several limitations in this study. First, the sample size of this study was small, including patients with left HFS and right HFS. To control the problem on the different sides of the lesion, we flipped the left HFS group from left to right. In the future, the changes of brain functional networks in patients with left and right HFS can be studied separately on the basis of expanding the sample size. Second, this study used a cross-sectional study design to explore the changes of the cortical-striatal network in patients with HFS. Longitudinal studies can be conducted in the future to explore the mechanism of brain network changes in different stages of HFS. Finally, previous studies and our study have all found functional abnormalities in the emotion-related cortex in patients with HFS. Therefore, increasing the evaluation of the psychological status of patients may make the results more reliable, which can be added in further studies. 



## Conclusion 
  
Primary unilateral HFS induces several FC alterations in the cortical-striatal network, specifically, the striatal subregions have altered connectivity with motor and OFC in patients with HFS, respectively. The severity of HFS is associated with these functional alterations. This study provides significant evidence that the altered cortical-striatal connectivity is involved in differential neural mechanisms of motor and emotional dysfunction in patients with HFS.

# Title

Age-Related Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Changes of Locus Coeruleus from Childhood to Older Adults

# Keywords

locus coeruleus

functional connectivity


# Abstract
 
The locus coeruleus is critical for selective information processing by modulating the brain’s connectivity configuration. Increasingly, studies have suggested that LC controls sensory inputs at the sensory gating stage. Furthermore, accumulating evidence has shown that young children and older adults are more prone to distraction and filter out irrelevant information less efficiently, possibly due to the unoptimized LC connectivity. However, the LC connectivity pattern across the life span is not fully examined yet, hampering our ability to understand the relationship between LC development and the distractibility. In this study, we examined the intrinsic network connectivity of the LC using a public fMRI dataset with wide-range age samples. Based on LC-seed functional connectivity maps, we examined the age-related variation in the LC connectivity with a quadratic model. The analyses revealed two connectivity patterns explicitly. The sensory-related brain regions showed a positive quadratic age effect (u-shape), and the frontal regions for the cognitive control showed a negative quadratic age effect (inverted u-shape). Our results imply that such age-related distractibility is possibly due to the impaired sensory gating by the LC and the insufficient top-down controls by the frontal regions. We discuss the underlying neural mechanisms and limitations of our study. 
 

# Body
 
## 1. Introduction 
  
The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small nucleus located deep in the brainstem and a major source of norepinephrine. The LC releases norepinephrine to almost the entire brain throughout its efferent projections according to both the phasic and tonic firing of LC neurons, thereby the LC is one of the primary brain regions critical for selective information processing by changing the brain’s configurations [ , , , , , , , , , ]. Recent studies consistently have suggested that the LC functionally controls sensory inputs at the early sensory gating stage by changing the brain’s connectivity configurations [ , , ]. For instance, the stimulated LC changes its neural communication with the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala [ ] and thalamus [ , ], which receive the majority of sensory information for the further in-depth cognitive process. Similarly, direct chemogenetic stimulation of LC immediately changes neural connectivity configurations, especially for the intrinsic networks that mediate the bottom-up sensory process, including the primary sensory and salience networks [ ]. That is, the LC plays a role in controlling sensory flows in the brain, suggesting that impaired processing selectivity is possibly due to the failure of communication between the LC and sensory regions that introduces the sensory overflows in the brain. 

Human imaging studies also imply that the LC system changes the bottom-up process at the early sensory-perceptual stage to prioritize important information. For example, the induced phasic LC activity by arousing or stressful stimuli at the early sensory-perceptual level increases the initial selective attention processes [ , , ] and attentional control [ , ]. Finally, such initial LC-induced selectivity at the early sensory stage carries over to the late cognitive processing such as memory encoding [ ], memory consolidation [ , ], and decision making [ ]. Thus, the interrupted LC activity has been often examined in individuals with conditions associated with hyperarousal and attentional vigilance such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [ , , ], and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [ , , ]. 

Recent studies also showed that older adults, who are more prone to distraction, exhibit interrupted LC connectivity [ , , , , , , , ]. For instance, older adults showed the hyper-connectivity of the LC with the primary sensory networks compared to younger adults as well as the hypo-functional coupling with the salience network [ ], suggesting that the impaired connectivity between the sensory regions and LC induces sensory overflows in the brain and thus the salience network fails to guide attention appropriately. As a result, there is an unnecessary depletion of limited neural resources in the brain leading the executive frontal systems to not maintain goal-directed processes due to irrelevant stimuli that should be ignored earlier.  

However, children’s developmental trajectories of LC connectivity have not been characterized yet. Healthy young children also show behavioral propensity to react to irrelevant information combined with heightened impulsivity [ , , ]. This distractibility in children is possibly due to their less-developed LC function during their early developmental stage, such that structural studies have demonstrated that structural integrity of the LC increases with age gradually and then declines after the peak (i.e., inverted U-shaped curvilinear trend) [ , , ]. Furthermore, studies suggest that brain development occurs first in the primary sensory bottom-up regions from early childhood with a progressively maturing top-down frontal system [ , ]. Thus, the unbalanced brain development in childhood between not-fully-developed LC and matured sensory network regions possibly leads children to fail at moderating sensory overflows in the brain. 

Considering accumulating evidence indicating that the LC plays an essential role in the brain’s processing selectivity, the overarching objectives of the current study are to provide a full description of LC connectivity pattern across the lifespan from early childhood to older adulthood. Given the brain development findings [ , , ] and heightened distractibility in early childhood and older adults [ , , , , ], we hypothesized that children and older adults, compared to younger adults and middle adults, show increased functional connectivity of the LC with the primary sensory regions (i.e., quadratic or u-shape curve), indicating that those two age groups have unnecessarily higher sensory sensitivity intrinsically even without task-induced activity (i.e., resting-state fMRI). We hypothesized the quadratic age effects because the development of structural integrity in the LC follows a curvilinear trend [ ] and behavioral performances also follow the inverted U-shape in general [ ]. To this end, we used cross-sectional samples (age-ranged between 8 and 83 years) and examined intrinsic functional connectivity of the LC associated with age changes based on the resting-state fMRI data. We especially examined the intrinsic network connectivity of the LC based on the resting-state fMRI signal as it reflects general intrinsic neural architecture of brain development at the time of the brain scan, rather than a moment-by-moment task-specific neural response [ , , , , ]. 


## 2. Materials and Methods 
  
### 2.1. Data Characteristics 
  
The present study was carried out using resting-state fMRI data from the enhanced Nathan Kline Institute (NKI)-Rockland project [ ]. The dataset was initially downloaded through the Mind Research Network’s collaborative informatics and neuroimaging suite (COINS) [ ]. We only included individuals with full-coverage of both T1 and EPI, and without severe motions (framewise displacement,   FD   > 0.5 mm), which resulted in 595 samples (  M   = 39.47 years,   SD   = 20.51, range = 8–83, 63.36% females; see  ). In this research, considering the previous studies [ , , , ], we referred to age groups approximately as follows: early childhood (<12), adolescents (12–20), younger adults (20–40), middle adults (40–60), and older adults (>60). All individual data were collected in the same scanning protocol with a 32-channel head-coil for the high-resolution structural image (T1-MPRAGE; TR = 1950 ms; TE = 2.52 ms; FA = 9°; 1-mm isotropic voxel; FOV = 256 mm) and EPI image (364 volumes; 2-mm isotropic voxel, 64 slices; TR = 1400 ms; TE = 30 ms; FA = 65°; matrix size = 112 × 112; FOV = 224 mm). 


### 2.2. Preprocessing 
  
Preprocessing was performed using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) combined with ICA-AROMA [ ] and ANTs [ ], including skull stripping and tissue mask segmentation (CSF/WM/GM) after bias-field correction for structural images, and first 10-volumes cut, motion correction, slice-timing correction, intensity normalization, regressing out CSF/WM with individually segmented masks, ICA-denoising (corrected mean FD = 0.02 mm, range = 0.01–0.14 mm;  B) and registration to standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 2-mm brain template for functional images. To avoid possible signal mixture of LC region with neighboring regions such as periaqueductal gray or ventral tegmental area, we skipped the signal smoothing step.  


### 2.3. Whole-Brain Multiple Regression Analysis for Age-Related Changes in LC Connectivity 
  
We first extracted the mean time-series of LC activity from the preprocessed image on each individual’s non-smoothed native space using a standard structural LC mask ( A) [ ]. Using this LC time course, a multiple regression analysis was then performed to estimate individual level LC-seed functional connectivity maps (z-transformed). Finally, changes of LC connectivity with age were estimated at the whole-brain level using a multiple regression model. Consistent with our main hypothesis, we examined the age-related variation in the LC connectivity with a quadratic model (i.e.,   age   and   age  ):  

In the model, we included   gender   in the design matrix as nuisance regressors to attenuate gender effects. The group-level whole-brain connectivity model was tested using non-parametric permutation-based inference (FSL’s randomise tool with 5000 permutations) [ ] with cluster threshold at   Z   = 3.1 (  p   = 0.001) and an   FWE-corrected p   at 0.05. 



## 3. Results 
  
Whole-brain multiple regression analysis on the LC connectivity revealed significant regions that have quadratic relationships with age. As expected, a significant positive quadratic relationship of age was found for connectivity between the LC and several other regions that are mainly associated with the sensory process (i.e., visual, somatosensory, auditory;  C–E). For example, visual processing regions along the ventral occipitotemporal and dorsal visual pathways including the occipital and temporal fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus [ ], decrease functional connectivity with the LC gradually from early childhood years to a low around 40–45 years old, and then increase according to age ( C). The parietal operculum extended to the central region and the cerebellum also showed the same u-shape curve of age effects on the LC connectivity ( D). These regions are known as the secondary somatosensory cortex involved in tactile and pain sensations [ ]. Finally, we found that regions in the primary auditory network including Heschl’s gyrus extended to the planum temporale [ ] showed the same quadratic age relationship on the LC connectivity ( E). To sum, these results indicated that during their respective development stages, children and older adults have increased sensory interaction with the LC in the brain. 

Importantly, we also found that there was a significant age-related negative quadratic effect on the LC connectivity for the frontal regions ( F). The frontal pole extended to the frontal medial cortex, known to be involved in action monitoring and cognitive control (e.g., action selection) [ ], showed lower LC connectivity during the early childhood and older adulthood years than younger and middle adulthood years (i.e., inverted U-shaped curve). In other words, the LC has stronger connectivity with the frontal regions during younger and middle adulthood years compared to both developing children and older adults. All significant regions of LC connectivity associated with ages are displayed in   and  . The group-mean of LC connectivity across ages is in  . 


## 4. Discussion 
  
The goal of the current study was to provide a full description of age-related changes in the intrinsic LC connectivity by adopting cross-sectional fMRI data from early childhood to older adulthood. Specifically, given the findings that children and older adults are prone to distraction [ , , , , , , , , , , , , ], we hypothesized that the LC, a critical region for selective information processing in the brain, showed distinct connectivity patterns with other regions in early childhood and older adulthood compared to younger and middle adults who show more stable attentional ability. As a result, we found that the LC’s connectivity with sensory regions showed a U-shaped curve pattern across ages, indicating that the sensory regions exhibit highly increased intrinsic connectivity with the LC in both early childhood and late older adulthood. The current findings suggest that such age-related distractibility is possibly due to the insufficient sensory gating process by the LC. Most importantly, the current analyses also revealed that the LC connectivity with the frontal regions showed an inverted U-shaped curve pattern. That is, while the sensory network regions are connected to the LC excessively, the frontal network regions have decreased connectivity with the LC, implying that the frontal control regions cannot handle the sensory overflows appropriately. These results are similar to the previous finding in that the LC showed curvilinear connectivity patterns with other cortical regions as a function of age [ ]. However, the previous study’s curvilinear patterns were cubic mostly, and most of them appeared in the frontal lobe rather than throughout the brain. In addition, our results showed two distinctive connectivity change patterns and covered a wider range of ages including early childhood. This is the first full description of how the LC configuration changes from early childhood to older adulthood, informing the LC model of distractibility in both children and older adults. 

The current findings implied that the increased distractibility at both early and late developmental stages is due to not only the LC-related excessive sensory overflows but also the lower LC connectivity in the frontal regions. However, although the observed patterns of LC connectivity for sensory and frontal regions are the same for both children and older adult groups, the underlying neural mechanisms for the attentional deficits regarding the LC connectivity may not be identical given structural differences in the developmental trajectory. At the early developmental stage, the primary brain structures including sensory cortex and subcortical bottom-up network regions mature first while the higher-cognitive prefrontal regions are still in the process of developing [ , ], whereas the LC does not yet fully function [ , , , ]. Thus, it is possible that the LC fails to appropriately prioritize sensory inputs inflow from the fully developed sensory networks, leading to sensory overflows in the children’s brain. That is, the immature LC which cannot control sensory inputs appropriately, and the overflow leads to the unnecessarily increased functional connectivity between LC and sensory regions. In addition, the LC fails to initiate the frontal control region for the flux of sensory inputs in the children’s brain, leading to the decreased functional connectivity. In contrast, given the finding of prominent age-related decline in brain volume as well as functional response of the prefrontal areas compared to other regions [ , ], the increased distractibility in the older adults is more derived from the decreased frontal functionality in controlling sensory inputs. Although the sensory networks also showed cortical thinning with the frontal cortex in older adults [ ], evidence indicates decreased sensory sensitivity in the brain at the early sensory gating stage. For instance, older adults have less activations in the visual and auditory cortex under the passive stimuli presentation [ ] suggesting that older adults have less sensory-perceptual sensitivity in terms of change detection. Therefore, the LC can still handle the reduced primary sensory processing even when the LC is functionally degraded, but the prominently decreased frontal control regions are overwhelmed by even less sensory inputs. It may cause the increased functional connectivity between the LC and the sensory and the decreased connectivity between the LC and the frontal control region. 

In the current study, we mainly examined the LC-centered neural connectivity across age which may possibly serve as the underlying neural mechanism for the attentional distractibility often observed at both early and late developmental stages. However, the suggested LC circuit mechanism sheds light on understanding other late cognitive process and attention-related mental disorders, as the current result showed the intrinsic connectivity pattern of the LC as a function of age, and it can be used as a framework to interpret the LC-involved neural activities. For instance, the attentional process involved in memory encoding. Some studies revealed that the LC is associated with memory encoding [ , ] and older adults with reduced LC structure showed poorer memory encoding [ ]. With regard to these studies, our results imply that the intrinsic LC-parahippocampal gyrus connection is a pivotal neural circuit of memory encoding in aging. As another example, ADHD is regarded as a mental illness characterized by hyperarousal and attentional vigilance [ ]. As described above, it is known that the LC is associated with ADHD. Our results may bring insight into understanding and/or predicting the neural underpinnings of ADHD developmental trajectories given that there have not been many studies involving adults with ADHD [ ]. 

However, there are some limitations in the current study. We examined intrinsic functional connectivity of the LC using the non-task based intrinsic neural network (i.e., resting-state fMRI) based on the previous behavioral observations of the increased attentional distractibility in the early childhood and older adulthood. Thus, our observation might be suboptimal to link actual attentional ability and LC-associated neural configurations compared to task-based assessments in the laboratory with various attentional tasks, which measure attentional selectivity and control more directly. We conjecture that additional attention-related brain regions and/or networks, such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex [ , ], and frontoparietal network [ , ], can be more involved in cognitive processing and the interactions between the additional regions and the LC can be estimated. Future research is needed to employ task-based assessments to link the attentional ability and LC connectivity changes across ages.  

Moreover, it is important to note that the LC is an exceptionally small structure in the brainstem, and thus it is difficult to locate its location and signal in an individual brain. Although we used the standard LC structure mask and extracted LC time-series (i.e., LC’s neural activity) from non-smoothed EPI image on the native space [ ] combined with the ICA-denoising [ , , ] to increase LC signal fidelity in the connectivity estimation, there are several ways to increase LC signal reliability. First, an additional T1-FSE scan (i.e., structural MRI scanning for norepinephrine neuron) can be used. With a 2–3 min duration in a scan, it allows to locate the individual neuromelanin structure such as substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and the LC on the native space [ , ]. Recent studies also suggested that T1 structural MRI with magnetization transfer (MT-weighted MRI) can distinguish the LC from its surroundings [ , ]. Unfortunately, the current study is based on public data and thus we could not utilize additional LC structure images given the pre-determined imaging protocols and collections. Secondly, extracting a seed signal without smoothing on the native space can minimize the mixture of signals between nearby regions [ ]. In our analysis, we used the non-smoothed LC time-series as a seed region neural activity. Thirdly, recent studies suggested a comprehensive mask [ ] and a high-confidence meta mask of the LC by aggregating multiple LC masks [ ]. For example, Dahl and colleagues yielded the high confidence mask by aggregating 6 LC masks [ , , , ] and showed that the meta mask captured LC-related hyperintensity accurately. Thus, it would also be beneficial to use the comprehensive or meta mask in the future study. Lastly, the LC is often confounded by physio artifacts such as cardiac pulsation and thus it is helpful to run additional physiological denoising [ ]. Although the ICA-denoising is a promising approach to mitigate physiological influence at the global level, the individual-based physiological denoising process using respiration and cardiac pulse signal can be more focal and direct to the brainstem signal fluctuation correction [ ]. In this instance we could not use individual specific LC masks or physiological noise correction. Therefore, in future work, it would be beneficial to utilize the LC structural scan and physiological data collection. 


## 5. Conclusions 
  
We analyzed the age-related LC connectivity changes with a quadratic model. A positive quadratic relationship of age was found for connectivity between the LC and sensory regions. A negative quadratic relationship was found between LC and frontal regions. Our results suggest that the increased distractibility at both early and late developmental stages is due to not only the LC-related excessive sensory overflow but also the lower LC connectivity with the frontal regions. It is noteworthy that the LC showed two distinctive connectivity change patterns as a function of age. Furthermore, we revealed the children’s LC connectivity configuration that has not been characterized yet. Our findings are the first full description of how the LC connectivity configuration changes across age.

# Title

What part of the brain is involved in graphic design thinking in landscape architecture?

# Keywords



# Abstract
 
Graphic design thinking is a key skill for landscape architects, but little is known about the links between the design process and brain activity. Based on Goel’s frontal lobe lateralization hypothesis (FLLH), we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brain activity of 24 designers engaging in four design processes—viewing, copy drawing, preliminary ideas, and refinement—during graphic design thinking. The captured scans produced evidence of dramatic differences between brain activity when copying an existing graphic and when engaging in graphic design thinking. The results confirm that designs involving more graphic design thinking exhibit significantly more activity in the left prefrontal cortex. These findings illuminate the design process and suggest the possibility of developing specific activities or exercises to promote graphic design thinking in landscape architecture.

## Introduction 
  
Design thinking is a highly cognitive activity that is widely used in design-related fields to solve the problem in the man-made environment. “Design methodology,” as described by Cross [ ], is the design process on work and thinking developed by designers through techniques or methods that reflect the knowledge to solve a problem. “Design as a discipline” involves different perceptions in the sciences, humanities, and design thinking, knowing, and practical methods [ ,  ]. Hence, we could infer that design thinking involves a series of reasoning mechanisms to select, identify, and then solve the problem [ ,  ,  ]. This design process is called “real-world problem solving” with the “select-and-combine model” [ ], which relates to the mechanism of conceptual sketches of cognition [ ] that might support the frontal lobe lateralization hypothesis (FLLH) in brain activations [ ]. Gero and Milovanovic [ ] considered that design thinking involves cognition, and researchers have tried to explore the design process through “protocol analysis,” “Black Box experiment,” and “survey” during design. Goel [ ] demonstrated architectural designs that included initial sketching with ambiguous lines, conceptual transformation, analysis, and adjustment of the spatial form, gradually converging the style and precision of its spatial structure to solve current problems. By contrast, Gillieson and Garneau [ ] highlighted that graphic design thinking as a design process uses visual communication, such as organization and logic, to define deductive and inductive thinking in space, which also involves personal experiences to recall, reframe, and solve the design problem. Their study addressed the design process by drawing a series of graphics to identify the space in the landscape. Therefore, in this study, we used the term “graphic design thinking” to explore the “Black Box” in landscape architecture design. 

Laseau [ ] described a thinking process assisted by sketching, while Geol [ ] identified four characteristics in design, including problem structuring, preliminary design, refinement, and detail, which use sketching to refine ambiguous ideas in the related arts (e.g., architectural design). This suggests that designers think through sketching to visualize and spatialize a concept map within incomplete ideas and refine those thoughts through abductive thinking [ ]. Landscape architecture design consists of a set of design processes, including the scope of the problem, the purpose, and the goal, which interprets “what” and “how” through the selection of material, landscape elements, colors, etc. in the design process to meet needs and create values [ ]. The abductive thinking helps designers to develop ideas and connect elements for thought completion [ ]. Moreover, the voices of potential users and related stakeholders are important [ ]. After the development of the selected solution, the specific idea for actualizing the detailed design will be considered complete. Based on the concept of sketching-assisted thinking proposed by Laseau [ ], Geol [ ], and Kolko [ ], we might infer that, for landscape architects, the landscape architecture design process is associated with the conceptual stages of a project, as landscape architects use sketching to nurture creative ideas, and graphic design thinking refines the ideas to develop and connect landscape elements for completion. 

A study proposed a framework of using electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain activation, which could offer a glimpse of the design process, such as design creativity, design reasoning, and problem-solving, during different design tasks [ ]. fMRI may allow a better understanding of design cognition, such as visual and spatial reasoning, in design thinking and creativity [ ]. Goel [ ] proposed the FLLH, in which the left and right prefrontal cortices (PFC) are responsible for different functions in real-world problem-solving. The hypothesis links the design cognitive process to brain activity in architectural design and planning [ ]. The right PFC is involved in planning, visual processing, or reasoning out of the initial concept and preliminary ideas. The right PFC contributes to the abstract, vague, and conceptual aspects of performance. By contrast, after selecting a specific solution and proceeding to further refinement, the left PFC assists in processing specific, clear, and practical information ( ) [ ]. 
   The design process and corresponding brain reactions (modified from Goel, 2014).    
The involvement of the PFC in cognitive mechanisms has been proven in neuropsychology [ ]. Related research on architecture and interior studies in design results linked with brain activation. The specific design tasks replete with sketching the frame and design items in space in various forms prompted our research design. In their study, Goel and Grafman [ ] demonstrated that a patient with frontal lobe lesions who was an architect was unable to perform a preliminary design in sketching the ideas. However, normal subjects could perform the preliminary design, refinement, and detail through the design process in the open-end design. The finding highlights the role of the right PFC in design thinking tasks, consistent with other findings on interior design [ ,  ,  ]. Alexiou et al. [ ,  ] showed that when subjects in their study used a trackball mouse to move objects during interior design tasks (with no restriction), certain brain areas (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), middle frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus) were more active than during problem-solving tasks (with the conditions). These results were consistent with those of Gilbert et al. [ ], who found that the right DLPFC and left frontal lobe were more active, stimulating potential solutions within visual imagery in design tasks. Further, these studies indicated that during design tasks, the activation of ACC could relate to cognitive and emotional functions [ ,  ]. The DLPFC and ACC are not only involved in executive functions, such as visual imagery and semantic processing, but also work together to construct new ideas that respond to problem solving in design tasks [ ,  ]. 

During design, designers use sketching to draw preliminary ideas and refine them. Landscape architecture design deals with landscape elements, such as water, plants, and pavements, to integrate elements into a whole that form the compatibility in the space. Architectural design involves structures and coordination in buildings. The design process might be similar. A landscape architecture design involves problem structuring, preliminary design, refinement, and detail, which, as proposed by Geol [ ], could represent the graphic design thinking process of design with different elements in the landscape. Using fMRI could shed light on the “Black Box” in the brain activation of landscape architects during the design process. To test the association between the different design processes and brain lateralization, this study explored the neural mechanisms associated with the graphic design thinking process by using a fMRI scan to identify parts of the brain that predominate during this phase of landscape architecture design. According to Goel [ ], the preliminary solution (or idea generation) phase activates the right PFC, whereas the refinement and detailing (or idea production) phase activates the left PFC. Thus, we hypothesized that the PFC would be activated during the landscape architecture design process as a key brain region that controls the design process. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
The participants (N = 24; 10 males; mean age = 34.50 years; SD = 2.03 years) all had at least three years of training in landscape architecture design. All were right-handed, with normal vision and hearing; none had a history of neurological disorders or cardiovascular disease, and all were screened for MRI compatibility. Each participant gave their written informed consent to the protocol #201411HM024 “  Neural Correlates of Landscape Design Creativity  :   An fMRI study  ” as approved by the Research Ethics Committee, Division of Research Ethics, Office of Research and Development, National Taiwan University. 


### Apparatus 
  
To test brain activity during landscape graphic design thinking, respondents were placed in an fMRI machine and asked to draw. However, as it is difficult to draw while lying in the fMRI machine, most researchers in previous studies asked participants to verbally describe, silently imagine their ideas, or click and remove the design items during the experiment, later drawing or writing down their ideas from memory outside the machine [ ,  – ]. In the present study, as the time difference between brain activity and reporting was problematic, we created a tilting acrylic table in the fMRI machine using a shoulder fixation cushion to help participants draw their designs while their brains were being scanned. The table was positioned over the participant’s waist ( ). The experimental tasks on the table were printed and bound on paper and were easily visible with a double mirror on an overhead coil. Participants turned the page to the next task after hearing a beep in their headphones. While performing the tasks, the participants were asked to move only their lower arm to reduce movement and unnecessary scanning noise.

### Stimuli 
  
The tasks involved two kinds of stimuli. The first task was to complete landscape plans from the book   From Concept to Form in Landscape Design   [ ]. The second task involved illustrations containing five geometric shapes ( ) to form a landscape, which included in holistic work of visual imagery, abstract reasoning, or refinement in the graphic design thinking procedure and complete in the design task. A total of four “viewing landscapes” and four “landscape architecture designs with geometric shapes” were arranged differently for the subjects in the research design.

### Procedure 
  
The experiment was designed to understand brain activity during the landscape architecture design process. The landscape graphic design process includes preliminary ideas, in which the participants think of initial solutions to the refinement problem-solving step. In the refinement phase, the subjects drew and refined their ideas during graphic design thinking, which we assumed activated the left PFC. Two types of tasks were provided in the experiments. The first task involved drawing without graphic design thinking (Task A-control), while the second task involved design cued by simple geometric forms for designing a landscape (Task B-design). To manage the effects of motion, each stimulus was presented twice, yielding four experimental conditions: “viewing” a complete landscape plan (A-1); “copying” this landscape plan on tracing paper (A-2); “preliminary ideas,” using geometric illustrations to envision a landscape architecture design (idea generation) (B-1); and “refinement” of the ideas, which uses designing skill to produce the preliminary ideas, reasoning, and drawing of landscape elements (idea production), consistent with the description of graphic design thinking assisted by sketching (B-2). The participants were requested to draw by their hands only during the experiment in the “copy drawing” and “refinement” conditions. 

The research design followed the characteristic of design [ ]. In the “viewing” condition, participants were asked to imagine that they were in the environment that the plan presented. In the “copy drawing” condition, participants were asked to trace the landscape plan on a tracing paper without any design. In the “preliminary ideas” condition, participants were asked to use several geometric illustrations to envision a landscape architecture design in their mind. In the “refinement” condition, participants were asked to draw the design they thought of in the preliminary ideas session. Based on the different stimuli, participants first copied the landscape plans and then used the geometric forms to develop a plan, section, or perspective drawing of their design according to their own preference. Each condition allowed 60 seconds for completion. During fMRI scanning, the participants completed two runs, which meant that each functional scan included four sessions and lasted for 558 seconds. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the counterbalancing task sequences, ABAB BABA or BABA ABAB ( ).

### Evaluation of the “refinement” stage in graphic design thinking scores 
  
To validate the results of the brain activation experiment, behavioral performance was measured to verify the level of “refinement” in graphic design thinking. Since graphic design thinking assisted by sketching to form design ideas, which might relate to developing creative design ideas, we used the concept of creativity to evaluate it. Previous research has indicated that qualitative research on creativity should be conducted in domain-specific ways [ ]. Because there is no standard method for evaluating creative landscape architecture design, we used the indicators in the Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults (ATTA) as our evaluation instrument. The ATTA is a validated creativity assessment instrument that asks subjects about the suitability of writing or drawing in a test of graphic design thinking. The content and volume of ideas in the drawings are used as objective indicators of a designer’s creativity. According to Guilford’s concept of creative thinking, four indicators—fluency, originality, elaboration, and flexibility—were used to rate the volume of ideas, novelty of concepts, level of detail, and diversity of ideas. 

To evaluate the level of refinement in participants’ graphic design creative thinking, we invited 10 senior landscape experts to assess the drawings on a 10-point Likert scale. Based on Guilford’s concept of creative thinking and the Torrance test, creativity levels were assessed in terms of three components: fluency, originality, and elaboration [ ].   Fluency   refers to the quantity of ideas produced; creative people are able to produce more ideas.   Originality   refers to ideas that are unusual, novel, unique, and different from others.   Elaboration   refers to the details considered and depicted over and above the core concept. Flexibility, the fourth component of creativity in the Torrance test, which tests the diversity of ideas, was not included in this study, as the experimental tasks provided geometric forms that limited the respondent’s flexibility. The score of each participant’s “refinement” level in the graphic design thinking was based on the average of the ten experts’ scores on the three relevant components. 


### fMRI data acquisition 
  
Images were acquired by a 3T SIEMENS MAGNETOM Prisma MRI with a 20-channel head coil. For each participant, a T2-weighted anatomical was obtained (TR = 9530 ms, TE = 103 ms, flip angle = 150°, field of view = 192×192 mm , x-y voxel size = 0.66×0.5 mm , 3mm thick). Two-dimensional echo-planar images (EPI) were acquired with a GRAPPA acceleration factor of two at repetition time TR = 3000 ms, echo time TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, field of view = 192×192 mm , matrix size = 64×64×45, and an effective resolution of 3×3×3 mm . In total, 45 EPI slices were sampled in a bottom-up, interleaved order. 


### fMRI data analysis 
  
FMRI images were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM8 software in MATLAB. The data for each participant were preprocessed as follows. First, slice timing was used to correct the timing of the functional series by using the middle slice as the reference point. Second, images were realigned to the first scan to correct translational and rotational motion within the subject throughout the time series. Third, using coregistration algorithms, the anatomical image (higher resolution image) was coregistered to functional images, providing better normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. As the next step in normalization of the functional image, the segment procedure divided the anatomical image into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. Next, the normalization step transformed the realigned functional image data from each individual subject to fit a standardized space, enabling the comparison of brains of varying shapes and sizes. Lastly, the smoothing procedure compensated for the remaining difference between subjects by applying an 8×8×8 mm  Gaussian smoothing kernel filter. 

Whole-brain analyses were estimated voxel by voxel according to a general linear model. Individual statistical maps modeled the time series using regressors and covariates. The covariates were yield movement parameters during the realigning process to control variance due to head movement. The regressors of interest included viewing (A1), copy drawing (A2), preliminary ideas (B1), and refinement (B2) sessions for each participant. In a second-level analysis, the group random effect was assessed for each contrast between participants. Significant regions of brain activation were evaluated by a one-sample t-test to determine whether the mean activation value across participants differed significantly from zero. 

According to the assumption of pure insertion, neural structures underlay a single process. First, we compared the difference between “preliminary ideas (B1)” and “viewing (A1)” to understand the design brain of provide preliminary ideas. Both of these two conditions involve the cognitive brain, which includes visual imagery to transport oneself into the landscape, but the “preliminary ideas” condition also engages the brain in generating ideas. Second, the brain region associated with the difference between “”refinement” (B2)” and “copy drawing (A2)” was identified to isolate the graphic design thinking activity. Both of these two conditions engage the brain in drawing a landscape, but the “graphic design thinking” condition also involves the brain in the refinement of the design. 



## Results 
  
### Sanity check 
  
To ensure a confident answer to the question of which brain area performs graphic design thinking, we first conducted a sanity check. First, we checked each subject’s translational and rotational motion during the functional scans. Both translational and rotational motion not exceed 5mm and 5 degrees was acceptable. The overall motion in each run showed in  . Second, as the experiments included two distinct conditions (with and without hand movements), we analyzed the differences between them to assess whether the primary motor cortex was activated [ ].

#### Copy drawing (A2) versus viewing (A1) 
  
We observed “copy drawing (A2)” versus “viewing (A1)” at a threshold of p < 0.05 FEW-corrected, extent threshold k > 20 voxels (see   and  ). This result indicates that the main area of brain activity was the left precentral gyrus ( ), which controls primary motion. Additionally, left-brain activation responded to right-hand movement.

#### Refinement (B2) versus preliminary ideas (B1) 
  
The result of “refinement (B2)” versus “preliminary ideas (B1)” at a threshold of p < 0.05 FEW-corrected and extent threshold of k > 20 voxels (  and  ) showed the left precentral gyrus as the main area of brain activation. This area controls primary motion and is consistent with the expected results for right-hand movement ( ).

The sanity check showed that when participants saw the same stimulus with and without hand movement, there was a difference in the activation of the primary motor cortex. As this confirms that the participants followed the instructions, the collected data could be utilized for the indicated purposes. 



### Hypothesis testing of the design process 
  
The study hypothesis was designed to test the relationship between design activity and the prefrontal cortex. While the preliminary ideas (idea generation) phase activated the right PFC, the refinement (idea production) phase activated the left PFC. 

#### Preliminary ideas (B1) versus viewing (A1) 
  
We did not find differences in BOLD signals between the “design without drawing (B1)” and “viewing (A1)” conditions at the threshold p < 0.05 FEW-corrected and extent threshold k > 20 voxels. 


#### Refinement (B2) versus copy drawing (A2) 
  
For “refinement” versus “copy drawing,” activation was observed in the left middle frontal gyrus (peak x, y, z = -52, 20, 30; t = 8.28), which formed part of the DPFC functional region (  and  ). As this brain region is in charge of cognitive processes, including working memory, cognitive flexibility, and planning [ ], there is support for the hypothesis that the left PFC is responsible for refinement (idea production).

### The relationship between brain activation parameters and refinement in graphic design thinking scores 
  
#### Refinement in graphic design thinking evaluation 
  
Inter-judge reliability was quite consistent among the 10 senior experts from the Council of Landscape Architecture Association. They awarded a mean score of 4.60 (SD = 0.75) for refinement in graphic design thinking (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.895). 


#### Correlation of the level of brain activation parameters and refinement in graphic design thinking scores 
  
We compared the designers’ work, specifically at the level of refinement in graphic design thinking, with the brain activity results. The scores correlated significantly with the Beta value (BOLD-magnitude of brain activation) of “refinement versus copy drawing” in the left middle frontal gyrus (r = 0.473, p < 0.05) ( ).

## Discussion and conclusions 
  
Based on these findings, the left middle frontal gyrus, which forms part of the PFC, contributed to graphic design thinking in the refinement steps of landscape architecture design (idea production). During the landscape architecture design process, the designers drew and thought simultaneously. The use of paper and pen, as in the real world, helped designers engage in graphic design thinking, which may explain the confirmation of the hypothesis that the PFC was active during idea production. 

Our results failed to confirm that right PFC activity is associated with the preliminary ideas (idea generation) phase. Having controlled for the imaginary landscape by analyzing “preliminary ideas versus viewing” (both of which are needed to imagine environmental space but differ in relation to graphic design thinking), there was no brain region activity shown for this phase in this study. It is possible that the imaginary landscape could not evoke sufficient graphic design thinking that can be captured in the brain result. 

The left and right PFCs play different roles in the design process. Goel [ ] proposed the FLLH to explain the relationship between the design process and brain activity. We found support for the hypothesis that the left PFC is involved in the refinement phases. Furthermore, the correlation analysis of refinement in graphic design thinking scores and the contrast between “refinement in graphic design thinking versus copy drawing” demonstrated a positive association with activation of the left middle frontal gyrus, which is part of the left PFC. Higher scores were related to higher activation in the left PFC. Several studies have used methods such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to improve creative performance [ ], suggesting a new direction for further study involving stimulation of the left middle prefrontal brain area to improve design skills. 

The present results confirm that the left middle frontal gyrus is involved in graphic design thinking in landscape architecture design and can be linked to the idea production phase of creativity [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Besides graphic design thinking, these findings also relate to other elements, such as emotions and personal experiences [ ,  ,  ,  ]. The landscape architecture design process, as it unfolds in the designer’s brain, warrants further experiment-based research to address a number of questions. First, how does emotion impact the designer while engaged in landscape architecture design, and how is the brain activated during different phases of the design experience? Second, what do differences between experts and non-experts reveal about the characteristics of the designer’s brain? There is also more to be learned about the mechanisms of creativity and methods for training our brains to be more innovative. Further research could consider other experimental tasks or repeat more tasks to maximize evoked changes in brain activation. Moreover, limited to the experimental tasks printed and bound on paper, the task sequence in this study has only two counterbalancing versions. It is better to randomize the experimental tasks to avoid ordering effect. These preliminary pilot experiment results will be further analyzed, developed, and replicated in pursuing this psychological line of investigation into the links between the process of landscape architecture design and human brain activity.

# Abstract
 
The present fMRI study aimed at highlighting patterns of brain activations and autonomic activity when confronted with high mental workload and the threat of auditory stressors. Twenty participants performed a complex cognitive task in either safe or aversive conditions. Our results showed that increased mental workload induced recruitment of the lateral frontoparietal executive control network (ECN), along with disengagement of medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate regions of the default mode network (DMN). Mental workload also elicited an increase in heart rate and pupil diameter. Task performance did not decrease under the threat of stressors, most likely due to efficient inhibition of auditory regions, as reflected by a large decrement of activity in the superior temporal gyri. The threat of stressors was also accompanied with deactivations of limbic regions of the salience network (SN), possibly reflecting emotional regulation mechanisms through control from dorsal medial prefrontal and parietal regions, as indicated by functional connectivity analyses. Meanwhile, the threat of stressors induced enhanced ECN activity, likely for improved attentional and cognitive processes toward the task, as suggested by increased lateral prefrontal and parietal activations. These fMRI results suggest that measuring the balance between ECN, SN, and DMN recruitment could be used for objective mental state assessment. In this sense, an extra recruitment of task‐related regions and a high ratio of lateral versus medial prefrontal activity may represent a relevant marker of increased but efficient mental effort, while the opposite may indicate a disengagement from the task due to mental overload and/or stressors.

## INTRODUCTION 
  
A fine‐grained understanding of how the brain copes with an important mental workload or a stressful situation is a major issue to promote human performance in a challenging environment. Complex and safety‐critical activities, such as piloting an airplane or operating a nuclear power plant, can lead to a drastic and simultaneous increase of both mental workload and acute stress. These effects originate from a combination of task complexity (Borghini, Astolfi, Vecchiato, Mattia, & Babiloni,  ; Causse, Chua, Peysakhovich, Del Campo, & Matton,  ; Durantin, Gagnon, Tremblay, & Dehais,  ) and the potentially fatal consequence of errors (Kilic & Ucler,  ). In this context, the maintenance of optimal cognitive performance is a constant challenge. According to several authors, high mental workload (Causse, Peysakhovich, & Fabre,  ) and acute stress (Arnsten,  ; Qin, Hermans, Marle, Luo, & Fernández,  ; Schoofs, Wolf, & Smeets,  ; Starcke, Wiesen, Trotzke, & Brand,  ) may both result in transient cognitive deficits, that is, impairments in executive functions and working memory (WM) in particular. Meanwhile, cerebral compensatory processes may be engaged and contribute to preserving cognitive performance (Fairclough & Mulder,  ). A primary objective for improving safety in these critical situations is therefore a better understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms involved in either maintenance or deterioration of cognitive performance under challenging conditions. 

Enhanced task complexity can result in an increase of mental effort, corresponding to the amount of brain resources/cognitive capacity an individual puts into a task (Galy, Cariou, & Mélan,  ), which might be indexed via brain activity or autonomic parameters (e.g., level of brain activity and pupil size). Task complexity also likely leads to greater mental workload, often inferred from overt behavior or performance. Mental workload roughly corresponds to the interplay between the demands of the environment (input load), human individual characteristics (capacities) and task performance (output) (Causse et al.,  ). A decrease in cognitive task performance will occur whenever there is a mismatch between environmental demands and individual capabilities, that is, if the workload is too high or too low (Kantowitz & Casper,  ). Thus, taking into account solely the task characteristics does now allow inferring the level of mental workload in an individual. 

In the scientific literature, mental workload and stress are often designated indistinctively with terms like “mental stress” (Hjortskov et al.,  ), probably because their causes and effects can be similar. Also, their occurrence can be concomitant: a task generating an important mental workload can lead to an increase in mental stress because the individual will be overwhelmed by the difficulty (Warm, Parasuraman, & Matthews,  ) or will feel the situation as emotionally challenging. However, mental workload and stress may reasonably be considered as distinct phenomena (Hidalgo‐Muñoz et al.,  ). According to Gaillard ( ), it is possible to work quite hard on difficult and complex tasks, even under unfavorable conditions, without cognitive strain or adverse physiological effects. High task demands can be met by mobilizing extra cognitive resources. In contrast, mental stress is regarded by Gaillard as a state, in which cognitive resources allocation is inefficient and disturbed by negative emotions. In other words, a high level of mental workload does not necessarily elicit a high stress level, and a high stress level may also occur when mental workload is low. Altogether, these results underline the difficulty to disentangle cognitively‐demanding from acute stress situations, as well as the importance of determining physiological mechanisms supporting both these situations and their possible co‐occurrence. 

Complex physiological and brain mechanisms take place with both high mental workload and acute stress. The executive control network (ECN) is of particular importance regarding cognitive load management. The ECN comprises the lateral and medial parts of the dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC), premotor regions and the lateral posterior parietal cortex. Its role is crucial for sustained and selective attention, cognitive flexibility, WM, and decision making in goal‐directed behaviors (Corbetta & Shulman,  ). During effortful tasks, increased demands on executive functions and WM enhance activity in the fronto‐parietal network of the ECN and in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Ayaz et al.,  ; Dosenbach, Fair, Cohen, Schlaggar, & Petersen,  ; Engström, Karlsson, Landtblom, & Craig,  ; Khachouf, Chen, Duzzi, Porro, & Pagnoni,  ; Mulert et al.,  ; Owen, McMillan, Laird, & Bullmore,  ; Power & Petersen,  ; Schmidt et al.,  ; Shenhav, Botvinick, & Cohen,  ; Shenhav et al.,  ). In particular, dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) activity increases linearly with WM load (Braver et al.,  ), suggesting that the DLPFC region of the ECN represents a reliable proxy measure of mental workload (Mandrick, Peysakhovich, Rémy, Lepron, & Causse,  ; Parent, Peysakhovich, Mandrick, Tremblay, & Causse,  ). A study of Shen et al. ( ) showed that connection strength between regions of the ECN is strongly correlated with executive function performance. High mental workload does not only elicit enhanced activity in the ECN: several brain regions can show reduced activity during the performance of demanding tasks, including the medial prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the precuneus. This set of regions belong to the default mode network (DMN) (Fransson & Marrelec,  ; Greicius, Krasnow, Reiss, & Menon,  ; Raichle et al.,  ; Ward et al.,  ). 

ECN activity is influenced not only by mental workload but also by acute stress (Arnsten, Wang, & Paspalas,  ; Hermans, Henckens, Joëls, & Fernández,  ; Van Oort et al.,  ). Depending on its level, stress may either improve or deteriorate the ECN function. Moderate levels of stress may induce a more efficient PFC function (Arnsten,  ; Yuen et al.,  ), while a highly stressful condition would induce an impaired PFC function (Arnsten et al.,  ). Other large brain networks seem to be sensitive to increased stress levels. During episodes of high levels of stress, engagement of the amygdala and related limbic structures has been reported, with significant activity in the anterior insula, the dorsal ACC, the hippocampus, and the hypothalamus (Hermans et al.,  ; Van Oort et al.,  ). This set of regions has been described as the salience network (SN). Involvement of the SN may sustain the orientation of attention toward salient information to promote threat detection. Accordingly, SN activity decreases under low or moderate levels of stress (Pruessner et al.,  ), while predominant involvement of the SN is observed under highly stressful situations. 

Few imaging studies have investigated the combined effects of cognitive workload and stressors. Under stress, activity in lateral PFC regions of the ECN implied in the cognitive task either increases (Clarke & Johnstone,  ; Porcelli et al.,  ), remains unchanged (Cousijn, Rijpkema, Qin, van Wingen, & Fernández,  ) or decreases (Qin et al.,  ). Accordingly, the PFC could have a critical role in mediating stress influence on cognition (Bogdanov & Schwabe,  ; Clarke & Johnstone,  ; Porcelli et al.,  ; Shields, Sazma, & Yonelinas,  ). Moreover, when acute stress and high cognitive load are combined, a dynamic interplay between ECN, DMN, and SN, possibly driven by the dorsal ACC and the ventral lateral PFC (VLPFC) (Clarke & Johnstone,  ; Pruessner et al.,  ; Simpson, Snyder, Gusnard, & Raichle,  ), may enable the reallocation of neural resources. A shift toward the SN and DMN would reduce cognitive efficiency (Qin et al.,  ) and enhance environment scanning at the cost of cognitive performance ensured by the ECN. Conversely, a shift toward the ECN, along with top‐down inhibition of the SN and DMN, may enable preservation of cognitive performance under stress. In previous studies, mental workload was elicited with WM tests such as two‐back letter or digit tasks. These tasks were combined with acute stress induced by an aversive movie (Cousijn et al.,  ; Qin et al.,  ), the threat of shock (Clarke & Johnstone,  ), or the cold pressor test (Duncko, Johnson, Merikangas, & Grillon,  ; Porcelli et al.,  ). In these studies, high‐load WM task accuracy was preserved under stress. Preservation of WM performance may pertain to the relatively moderate perceived workload and the involvement of emotion regulation mechanisms. Conversely, other studies have reported reduced performance following exposure to stressors, either psychosocial (Jiang & Rau,  ; Schoofs, Preuß, & Wolf,  ) or physical (cold pressor test) (Schoofs et al.,  ). Hence, there is no clear pattern for the influence of stress on cognition, this influence being likely dependent on the height of the cognitive load and the level and nature of stress. In particular, it still remains unclear whether performance on a more demanding cognitive task, relying on the ECN and efficient PFC function, could be maintained under stressors (Clarke & Johnstone,  ; Porcelli et al.,  ; Schoofs et al.,  ). 

In the present fMRI study, we investigated performance and brain activity during a highly difficult task performed under varying levels of task difficulty and the threat of stressors. We introduced a paradigm that reproduces the mentally challenging conditions that operators face during degraded contexts. To achieve this aim, we used the novel Toulouse n‐bask task (TNT) that combines a classical n‐back task with mental arithmetic. The n‐back WM paradigms were consistently shown to imply bilateral DLPFC and dorsal lateral parietal regions. Mental calculation involves a large‐scale network, including lateral and medial prefrontal and motor regions, as well as inferior and superior parietal cortex (Gruber, Indefrey, Steinmetz, & Kleinschmidt,  ; Klein, Moeller, Glauche, Weiller, & Willmes,  ; Kong et al.,  ). By combining n‐back WM and mental arithmetic processes, the TNT task was thus thought to rely heavily on an extended fronto‐parietal network encompassing the ECN, and was conceived to mimic the multidimensional high mental workload existing in many safety‐critical occupations such as aircraft piloting (Mandrick et al.,  ). In addition, this novel n‐back task was completely embedded into a threatening or safe context. The threatening context was induced using frequent but unexpected occurrences of aversive auditory stimuli played in parallel with the task. This induction method is potentially more efficient than the use of a punctual emotional induction delivered before the task, whose effects can fade out progressively, for example, when using an emotional movie clip before task execution (Cousijn et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ; Jiang & Rau,  ; Qin et al.,  ). Also, previous research using physical stressors during task performance may have been confounded by distraction effects due to the salience of the stimulus (Duncko et al.,  ; Porcelli et al.,  ; Schoofs et al.,  ). In this study, we were interested in the experienced stress per se, we thus excluded the time period during which the aversive stimuli were delivered, focusing on the effects of the threat of unpredictable loud unpleasant sounds. Another important aspect of the experimental paradigm was the manipulation of both task difficulty and the presence of stressors while measuring pupil diameter and cardiac activity, both being particularly sensitive to mental effort (Eysenck & Calvo,  ; Fairclough & Houston,  ; Gray & Braver,  ; Peysakhovich, Causse, Scannella, & Dehais,  ) and stress (DeBeck, Petersen, Jones, & Stickland,  ; Yao et al.,  ). Such physiological recordings are feasible in situ, for example, in cockpits during flight. Thus concurrent neuroimaging and physiological measures during variable mental load and stress conditions are particularly relevant (Alnæs et al.,  ; Brown et al.,  ; Khachouf et al.,  ; Mandrick et al.,  ; Parent et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). We thus investigated how brain activity co‐varied with these two physiological measurements thanks to parametric modulation analyses. 

We hypothesized that cognitive performance would deteriorate under high workload and we expected greater involvement of the ECN regions, particularly the DLPFC and the lateral parietal cortex, and deactivations of the DMN, altogether suggesting increased mental workload due to the challenging task. Both heart rate and pupil diameter should be increased. We also expected that performance should be relatively preserved under stress induction thanks to emotional regulation. However we expected that the combination of high task difficulty and stress induction may lead to an overload of the ECN. A marked decrease of task performance and an opposite brain pattern of activations to those observed under the high workload should be observed, with a decrease in the ECN regions along with SN activations. Heart rate and pupil diameter might be either increased or decreased since a disengaging of the task may occur, generating a decline of the sympathetic activity, while the stress could, on the contrary, increase sympathetic activity. 


## METHODS AND MATERIALS 
  
### Participants 
  
Twenty young, healthy participants (6 females, 14 males; mean age = 24 years,   SD   = 3.9 years and range = 20–34) were involved in this study. All had studied for at least 2 years at university (after completion of their secondary education). Four participants were left‐handed, while the others were right‐handed. The hand dominance did not affect behavioral performance reported in this study. None reported either affective or anxiety disorders or any neurological or cardiovascular disease. None were under any form of medication that might affect the brain or autonomic functions. All participants reported normal auditory acuity and normal or corrected‐to‐normal vision. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki for human experimentation and was approved by a National Ethics Board (CPP du Sud‐Ouest et Outre‐Mer IV, no. CPP15‐010b/2015‐A00458‐41). All participants signed a consent form and were paid for their participation. They were informed that they would be submitted to unpleasant loud sounds in the MRI scanner. 


### Stress induction 
  
Stress (sustained anxiety) induction was performed with the threat of unpredictable loud unpleasant sounds, such as blackboard scratching, plate scratching with a fork, dentist's drill, and so on (Patel et al.,  ). Thirty‐four sounds were selected based on previous works (Grillon et al.,  ; Hirano et al.,  ; Kumar, Forster, Bailey, & Griffiths,  ; Zald, Hagen, & Pardo,  ) and on a survey that we conducted on a separate group of 87 participants. According to our survey, the sounds were globally perceived as mildly stressful, uncomfortable, and unpleasant. 

During the training session of the present experiment, participants were first asked to estimate the maximum acceptable sound level they could bear (ranging from 80 to 95 dB). This maximum acceptable sound level was later set in the fMRI. They were then exposed to the 34 different sounds. Each participant evaluated these sounds (7‐s duration each) by rating them on a scale from 0 (not aversive) to 10 (highly aversive). Based on the individual ratings, the 17 most unpleasant sounds were selected for each participant to be further presented during the MRI session. The 17 sounds played during the experiment were rated at 7.42 on average across all the participants. Following this, participants were trained to associate “safe” (no aversive sounds) and “threat” (aversive sounds) conditions with colored screens, that is, blue screen and red screen, respectively. During the safe condition, participants had nothing to do except quietly watching the blue colored screen. During the threat condition, participants had to pay attention to several unpleasant loud sounds while watching the red screen. 

In the MRI scanner, participants were informed that they would be exposed to unpredictable aversive loud sounds, among those they rated as the most unpleasant, during either active or rest blocks. The onset of sounds was unknown to participants in order to maintain a continuous threat (Grillon et al.,  ; Zald & Pardo,  ). The aversive sounds occurred randomly during all cognitive tasks and rest conditions and were noncontingent upon the performance of the participant to the task. Each of the 17 aversive sounds was presented once to the participant to prevent habituation. They could be played one time or two consecutive times (without pause between the two occurrences), and never occurred again later in the experiment. The sounds were played via MR‐compatible monitor headphones in stereo mode. 


### n‐back task 
  
The Toulouse n‐back Task (TNT) was implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks) using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (Brainard,  ; Kleiner, Brainard, & Pelli,  ; Pelli & Vision,  ). The task is described in detail in a previous publication (Mandrick et al.,  ). The task was developed to combine a classical n‐back task with mental arithmetic. Instead of memorizing and comparing unique items, as in the classical n‐back task, the participants had to memorize and to compare the results of arithmetic operations, computed beforehand. Arithmetic operations were either additions or subtractions. All numbers were multiples of five (e.g., 15 + 40, 90–35). The arithmetic operations (trials) were presented for 2.5 s, followed by an interstimulus‐interval of 0.5 s. Volunteers were required to compute the result of the arithmetic operations and compare it with either a fixed number (0‐back) or the result obtained two trials before (2‐back). In the 0‐back condition, the “target” fixed number was “50.” Participants were therefore asked to press a specific button when the result of the operation was 50. In the 2‐back condition, the participants were asked to press the button whenever the result of the arithmetic operation was identical to the one presented two trials ago (“match”), see Figure  . 
  
Experimental design. (a) Toulouse n‐back task (TNT). The active blocks consisted of 12 trials and lasted 36 s. They were interleaved with 24‐s rest blocks (R). Participants responded to targets and nontargets by pressing one of two different buttons. The side of the buttons was counterbalanced across participants. (b) experimental timeline. The experiment included five functional runs (two safe runs without any sounds and three threat runs with the possible occurrence of aversive sounds), presented in a counterbalanced order. TNT difficulty levels (0‐back and 2‐back) were counterbalanced and alternated with rest periods. Unpredictable aversive loud sounds were presented randomly during threat runs and could occur during rest and active blocks 
  

### Procedure 
  
The entire protocol lasted approximately 3 hr. Before scanning, participants performed the training session, during which they were exposed to the auditory stressors further used in the MRI. They were also trained on the TNT for the two levels of task difficulty, that is, 0‐back and 2‐back. This cognitive training included at least one block for the 0‐back condition and three blocks for the 2‐back condition, until participants felt comfortable with the TNT. Furthermore, the training was successively performed in both the safe and the threat conditions. In the MRI, the TNT was presented using a video projector on a translucent screen placed above the head of the participant. He or she viewed the stimuli through a mirror mounted on the head coil above their eyes. Head movement was restricted using foam cushions. All participants underwent five functional runs (apart from two participants, who performed only four runs due to technical problems). The five functional runs consisted of two safe runs and three threat runs with the possible occurrence of aversive sounds, see Figure  . We chose to design a within‐subject study (all the participants underwent safe and aversive conditions with concomitant n‐back task). Indeed, we expected rather large intersubject variability in cognitive performance on the complex n‐back calculation task (Mandrick et al.,  ). Therefore, comparing TNT performance in two groups of participants with a between‐subject design may have confounded our results regarding stress effects on cognition. Moreover, similar studies have been previously conducted with no visible effect of stress persistence across stressful and safe alternate sessions (Clarke & Johnstone,  ; Cousijn et al.,  ). The order of the safe and threat runs was counterbalanced across participants. Half of the participants started each run with the 0‐back level and the other half with the 2‐back level. The TNT was presented with a blocked design. Each functional run included 12 cycles of alternating 0‐back and 2‐back 36‐s active blocks interleaved by 24‐s rest blocks. Within each active block, a series of 12 arithmetic operations (trials) were presented to the participant. The participant was given a 2‐button response box (one button for “target,” the other for “no target”) and was asked to respond as quickly as possible. Each active block contained four targets in random positions. Active blocks were preceded by an instruction cue lasting 6 s. The instruction cue informed the participant about the next n‐back level (0‐back or 2‐back) and the screen color background indicated whether it will be a safe (blue screen) or a threat (red screen) condition. The color was not visible during the active blocks, arithmetic operations were displayed in the center of a gray background. During the rest blocks, “00 + 00” operations were presented and the participant did not give any response. The MRI scanning session lasted about 1 hr and 15 min. 


###  MRI   data acquisition 
  
MRI data were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3‐T scanner (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) at the Toulouse Neuroimaging Center technical platform (referred to as ToNIC Inserm UMR 1214), using a 32‐element SENSE head coil. Each of the five functional runs included successive acquisitions of 285 whole‐brain T2*‐weighted echo planar images with blood oxygenation level‐dependent contrast (EPI‐BOLD) sequence [40 axial slices with ascending acquisition order, repetition time (TR) = 2.60 s, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, 90° flip angle, matrix size = 96 × 96, slice‐thickness = 3 mm with no slice gap, field of view (FOV) 240 × 240 mm ]. In addition to the five functional runs, each participant also underwent a high‐resolution 3D anatomical scan for functional overlay and stereotaxic transformation. This scan was acquired using a T1‐weighted 3D magnetization‐prepared rapid gradient‐echo (MP‐RAGE) sequence (TR = 8.1 ms, TE = 3.7 ms, 8° flip‐angle, 170 contiguous sagittal slices with matrix size 240 × 240, FOV 240 × 240 × 170 mm ). 


### Autonomic nervous system measures in the   MRI  
  
For heart rate measures, the ECG signal was recorded continuously at 500 Hz throughout MRI scanning with an MR‐compatible pulse oximeter (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) attached to the left index finger. Moreover, the pupil diameter of the left eye was recorded continuously with an MR‐compatible eye‐tracking device (long‐range optic ASL EyeTracker 6000, Applied Science Laboratories, Bedford, Massachusetts) at a sampling rate of 60 Hz. The eye‐tracker was positioned behind the scanner and the translucent screen. A hole with a radius of 3 cm was made at the bottom of the screen so that the camera could monitor the subject's eye on the mirror and the infrared light emitter could illuminate the pupil to assess its size. 


### Subjective ratings of task difficulty and anxiety 
  
A debriefing session was conducted after MRI scanning. Participants were asked to rate the difficulty of the TNT task and the level of anxiety induced by task difficulty and by the threat of the aversive sounds. The rating was done on a 0–10 scale. 


### Data analysis 
  
#### Behavioral data 
  
The mean percentage of correctly reported match/no‐match response (corresponding to performance success) and the mean reaction times were calculated for each participant and in each of the four experimental conditions. In addition, d‐prime was calculated as   z  (hit rate) −   z  (false alarm rate). The three variables were analyzed across participants using repeated‐measures 2 × 2 ANOVA with factors of cognitive load (0‐back, 2‐back) and threatening context (safe, threat). 


#### Autonomic nervous system measure analysis 
  
##### Heart rate 
  
ECG signal was first visually controlled for outliers and artifacts. Signal was processed with the “findpeaks” function of MATLAB 2019. The series of R–R interval times were then derived from the ECG and the mean heart rate was calculated for each active 36 s block. Hear rate was then averaged for each of the four experimental conditions. These mean values were further used as parametric modulators in fMRI first‐level models (see below). 


##### Pupil diameter 
  
Pupil diameter signal was processed using home‐made MATLAB scripts. Periods of signal loss and blinking as well as six samples before and after each signal loss period (100 ms at 60 Hz) were linearly interpolated. Trials where the number of interpolated samples exceeded 50%, were excluded from analyses. The signal was low‐passed using a 9‐point moving average filter. The pupil diameter was then averaged over all trials of each active 36‐s block, and then averaged for each of the four experimental conditions. Therefore, the mean pupil diameter values were modulated by both tonic and phasic pupil changes induced by cognitive load and/or threatening context. These mean values were further used as parametric modulators in fMRI first‐level models (see below). 



####  MRI   data preprocessing 
  
Image preprocessing and statistical analysis were performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8) ( ). Functional images were realigned to the first volume with a six‐parameter rigid‐body transformation and the mean functional image was co‐registered to participant's T1‐weighted MR image. Functional images were corrected for slice acquisition timing. Anatomical images were then segmented based on tissue probability maps of gray matter, white matter and CSF in the standard MNI space. The deformation field used for the segmentation was applied to the T1‐weighted and functional images for normalization into MNI stereotactic space. Functional images were resampled into 2‐mm isotropic voxels. Finally, functional images were spatially smoothed by convolving with an isotropic 3D‐Gaussian kernel (8‐mm full width at half maximum). 


####  MRI   data statistical analyses 
  
##### First‐level analyses 
  
For each participant, six experimental conditions were implemented as box‐car functions with an epoch length of 36 s, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Specifically, individual models included four regressors of interest (corresponding to 0‐back safe, 2‐back safe, 0‐back threat, and 2‐back threat epochs) and two regressors of no interest corresponding to the 0‐back and 2‐back task epochs, during which aversive sounds were presented. These two latter conditions of no interest (12 blocks in total) were modeled to exclude any auditory perception effect or any potential distraction effect of sound, and to selectively tackle the effect of stress related to the expectancy of the unpredictable sounds. Rest epochs were implicitly modeled. In this first model, simple contrasts for each of the four conditions of interest were created, comparing active conditions with resting baseline. Moreover, in order to modulate condition effects by autonomic measures, two additional first‐level models were implemented for each participant, which consisted of the same six box‐car regressors with parametric modulation by either heart rate or pupil diameter. To this aim, heart rate and pupil diameter values were averaged over each 36‐s block (see below) and these mean values were entered as parametric modulators of each condition regressor in two separate models. Brain activity specific to each condition and co‐varying with either heart rate or pupil diameter could therefore be assessed. For each of the latter two models, four simple contrasts were created for modulated active conditions versus resting baseline. All first‐level models furthermore included high‐pass filtering using a cutoff of 1/128 Hz, global intensity normalization and serial correlations correction using a first‐order autoregressive model. 


##### Second‐level analyses 
  
For group analyses, individual contrasts were entered into a random‐effects model, using the flexible factorial tool in SPM8. A repeated‐measures 2 × 2 ANOVA model was implemented, with task difficulty (two levels: 0‐back and 2‐back) and threat (two levels: safe and threat) as within‐subject factors. Main effects investigated brain activations (i.e., 2‐back > 0‐back and threat > safe) and brain deactivations (i.e., 2‐back < 0‐back and threat < safe) related with TNT difficulty and level of threat. Moreover, difficulty × threat interaction effects investigated differences in brain mechanisms elicited by cognitive effort, during threat and safe conditions. We implemented 3 s‐level ANOVA models, using individual contrasts derived from first‐level analyses (a) without any parametric modulation, (b) with heart rate parametric modulation, and (c) with pupil diameter parametric modulation. In the group analysis that does not take autonomic modulation into account, activations were investigated at an initial voxel‐level threshold of   p   < .001 uncorrected, with an extent threshold of 10 voxels, and a cluster‐level threshold of   p   < .005 corrected for multiple comparisons (family wise error‐FWE) at the whole‐brain level was applied. We reported only the clusters surviving this correction for all contrasts investigated. For the complementary exploratory group analyses which included autonomic parametric modulation analyses, sensitivity was favored over specificity (Wilke,  ). Therefore, significance was assumed at   p   < .005, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Since we were particularly interested in ECN regions, we used SPM's small volume correction (SVC) at specific MNI coordinates in the DLPFC previously established as functionally connected to a pupil‐related network (DiNuzzo et al.,  ). 


##### Functional connectivity analysis 
  
Task‐based connectivity analysis was performed using the SPM CONN toolbox ( ) to investigate changes in connectivity due to the threat of auditory stressors. For each participant, realignment parameters were entered as first‐level covariates, and preprocessed functional images were denoised (using standard CONN procedures) to remove unwanted motion artifacts prior to calculation of connectivity measures. A band‐pass filter of 0.008–0.09 Hz was applied. ROI‐to‐ROI connectivity estimates were computed from correlations of BOLD signal between seed regions evidencing significant effects during threat with all ROIs from the CONN atlas. At the second‐level, differences in connectivity between threat and safe conditions were analyzed across all participants. Significant changes in connectivity due to threat were assessed at a threshold of   p   < .05 with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. 





## RESULTS 
  
### Anxiety and task difficulty subjective ratings 
  
The average levels of anxiety induced by the four experimental conditions were 0.90 (  SD   = 0.85) for “0‐back safe,” 1.95 (  SD   = 1.28) for “0‐back threat,” 3.65 (  SD   = 1.90) for “2‐back safe,” and 5.10 (  SD   = 2.17) for “2‐back threat” (Figure  , top left panel). Subjective anxiety was significantly higher in the 2‐back versus 0‐back condition [  F  (1,19) = 51.71,   p   < .001,   η   = .73] and in the threat versus safe condition [  F  (1,19) = 15.72,   p   < .001,   η   = .45]. The interaction term was also significant [  F  (1,19) = 4.75,   p   = .042,   η   = .20], with increased anxiety when threat and 2‐back conditions were combined.

Light gray = 0‐back, medium gray = 2‐back, plain bar = safe, striped bar = threat 
  
The subjective levels of difficulty induced by the 0‐back and 2‐back conditions were, respectively, 1.40 (  SD   = 0.94) and 5.95 (  SD   = 1.93) (Figure  , top right panel). Repeated‐measures ANOVA showed that subjective difficulty was significantly higher in the 2‐back versus 0‐back condition [  F  (1,19) = 133.45,   p   < .001,   η   = .88]. 


### n‐back performance 
  
#### Percentage of correct responses 
  
The percentage of correct responses induced by the four experimental conditions were 94.44% (  SD   = 4.05) for “0‐back safe,” 94.71% (  SD   = 3.80) for “0‐back threat,” 78.70% (  SD   = 20.31) for “2‐back safe,” and 78.14% (  SD   = 20.25) for “2‐back threat” (Figure  , middle left panel). Participants showed lower percentage of correct response with increased difficulty [  F  (1,19) = 18.33,   p <   .001,   η   = .49]. The threat of unpredictable auditory stressors did not impact accuracy (  p   = .853). The interaction term was not significant (  p   = .502). 


#### d‐prime 
  
The average d‐prime induced by the four experimental conditions was 2.43 (  SD   = 0.22) for “0‐back safe,” 2.48 (  SD   = 0.24) for “0‐back threat,” 1.63 (  SD   = 0.64) for “2‐back safe,” and 1.60 (  SD   = 0.55) for “2‐back threat.” Participants showed lower d‐prime with increased difficulty [  F  (1,19) = 118.31,   p <   .001,   η   = .86]. The threat of unpredictable auditory stressors did not significantly impact d‐prime values (  p   = .696). The interaction term was not significant (  p   = .270). 


#### Reaction times 
  
The reaction times induced by the four experimental conditions were 1.16 s (  SD   = 0.27) for “0‐back safe,” 1.27 s (  SD   = 0.29) for “0‐back threat,” 1.64 s (  SD   = 0.25) for “2‐back safe,” and 1.57 s (  SD   = 0.35) for “2‐back threat” (Figure  , middle right panel). Participants showed longer reaction times with increased difficulty [  F  (1,19) = 54.73,   p   < .001,   η   = .74]. The main effect of threat was not significant (  p   = .528). The difficulty × threat interaction was significant [  F  (1,19) = 7.68,   p   = .012,   η   = .12], showing an increase of reaction times due to threat in the 0‐back condition and a decrease of reaction times in the 2‐back condition. However, HSD post hoc tests revealed no significant pairwise comparisons between threat and safe conditions. 



### Autonomic nervous system results 
  
#### Heart rate 
  
The mean heart rate induced by the four experimental conditions was 74.42 bpm (  SD   = 8.60) for “0‐back safe,” 73.49 bpm (  SD   = 8.38) for “0‐back threat,” 77.31 bpm (  SD   = 8.61) for “2‐back safe,” and 76.63 bpm (  SD   = 8.63) for “2‐back threat” (Figure  , bottom left panel). Participants showed a higher heart rate with increased task difficulty [  F  (1,19] = 53.69,   p   < .001,   η   = .74]. The main effect of threat and the interaction term were not significant (  p   = .180 and   p   = .419, respectively). 


#### Pupil diameter 
  
The mean pupil diameter induced by the four experimental conditions was 41.17 mm (  SD   = 7.86) for “0‐back safe,” 41.16 mm (  SD   = 7.58) for “0‐back threat,” 44.33 mm (  SD   = 8.09) for “2‐back safe,” and 44.15 mm (  SD   = 8.11) for “2‐back threat” (Figure  , bottom right panel). Participants showed higher pupil diameter with increased task difficulty [  F  (1,19) = 60.08,   p   < .001,   η   = .76]. The main effect of threat and the interaction term were not significant (  p   = .823 and   p   = .490, respectively).

Large‐extent clusters of activity were found in the 2‐back versus 0‐back level of the TNT task (Figure  ). We found increased activity in the left and right lateral parts of the middle frontal gyrus belonging to the DLPFC (BA 9), the dorsal ACC (BA 32), the supplementary motor area (SMA, BA 6), and the dorsal premotor cortex (BA 6). A large posterior cluster was also found covering bilateral parietal regions (BA 7/40).

Conversely, some regions were less activated in the 2‐back compared with the 0‐back task. Such effects may represent regional deactivations when participants were engaged in the 2‐back condition. Significant deactivated clusters were observed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC, with peaks located in BA 10/11) extending to the ventral ACC, the bilateral insula, the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), hippocampi and amygdala, and the posterior cingulate cortex. Regional activation and deactivation peaks are reported in Table   and illustrated in Figure  .

#### Main effect of auditory stressors 
  
When comparing threat versus safe conditions, activations were found in the bilateral parietal cortices (inferior parietal lobule, BA 40) and the SMA (Figure  ). The inverse contrast (threat < safe) revealed large‐extent bilateral deactivated regions induced by the threat condition. The clusters encompassed bilateral superior temporal regions (STG, including primary and secondary auditory cortices) and extended to lower parietal regions and amygdala. Deactivations were also found in the DMPFC (BA 8/9/10), the ventral ACC (32), and the VMPFC (orbitofrontal cortex, BA47). Occipital regions were also deactivated, as well as the posterior cingulate gyrus (BA 31). Activation and deactivation peaks are reported in Table   and illustrated in Figure  .

#### Task‐based connectivity related to threat of auditory stressors 
  
The main effect of auditory stressors evidenced significant deactivations in the auditory cortex and in limbic regions belonging to the SN, suggesting inhibition of these regions through top‐down control to reduce the impact of stressors and for emotional regulation. We used bilateral Heschl's gyrus and amygdala atlas ROIs (from the CONN toolbox) as seeds to investigate functional connectivity with all other atlas ROIs. We then compared the connectivity strength between threat and safe conditions (irrespective of the level of task difficulty). At a threshold of   p   < .05 FDR‐corrected, auditory ROIs showed significant connectivity with dorsal prefrontal and parietal regions, although no significant difference in connectivity related to threat could be evidenced. Functional connectivity of amygdala regions with dorsal regions was also significant, and was increased during the threat of stressors (Figure  ,   p   < .05 FDR‐corrected). More precisely, the connectivity between the right amygdala and right inferior parietal cortex (supramarginal gyrus) and the connectivity between the left amygdala and the MPFC were higher during threat (  t   = 3.04,   p   = .007 FDR‐corrected for amygdala‐parietal and   t   = 2.24,   p   < .036 FDR‐corrected for amygdala‐prefrontal connectivity).

#### Interaction between mental workload and auditory stressors 
  
Mental workload‐related increases of activity were more important during the threat compared with the safe condition, that is, positive Difficulty × Threat interaction, in the bilateral superior parietal cortices, in the SMA (Figure  ) and also in two clusters located in the DLPFC (BA 9/46). Conversely, load‐related decreases of activity were more pronounced during the threat condition, that is, negative Difficulty × Threat interaction, in the VMPFC and bilateral hippocampus. Activation and deactivation peaks are reported in Table   and illustrated in Figure  .

#### Brain activity co‐varying with heart rate and pupil diameter based on parametric modulation analyses 
  
The increase of brain activity due to mental workload (2‐back > 0‐back) did not significantly co‐vary with heart rate or pupil diameter (threshold of   p   < .005). During expectation of auditory stressors (threat > safe), the increase of activity in several brain regions was positively correlated with heart rate and pupil diameter. Heart rate variations were notably associated with modulations of activity in the occipital lobe, hippocampus, precuneus or ventral posterior cingulate cortex (Table  ). Pupil diameter variations under the threat condition were associated with higher dorsal prefrontal regions (BA 9/8/10) and occipital activity (Table  ). It is worth noting that pupillary changes track cognitive workload at a fine‐grained level. Therefore, as mental workload induced variations in tonic pupil diameter between blocks, it would also be interesting to perform a point‐by‐point correlation analysis (i.e., at the fMRI temporal resolution) between the phasic pupillary response and brain activity. However, due to technical difficulties, the pupillary and BOLD signals were point‐by‐point synchronized only in 12 participants. A further investigation of this sub‐sample might reveal correlations between workload‐induced changes in tonic pupil diameter, phasic pupillary response, and brain activations.

## DISCUSSION 
  
We investigated the way the brain deals with an important mental workload and/or a threat situation. We speculated that our TNT n‐back task with additional cognitive workload (mental calculation) would deteriorate under high workload and we expected greater involvement of the ECN regions. Overall, the slight decrease in performance indicated that task difficulty actually increased mental workload and provoked an enhanced activity in the ECN, in particular the lateral prefrontal and parietal regions, along with a disengagement of the DMN, including the medial prefrontal cortex. Task difficulty also clearly affected subjective difficulty and autonomic activity with increased heart rate and pupillary diameter. 

We expected a moderate decrease of performance with the stressors, and a large decrease of performance related to the ECN disengagement when high task difficulty was combined with the stressors. This scenario turned out to be wrong despite increased subjective anxiety with threat. Preservation of performance under threat might be due to efficient cognitive strategies used by participants, as indexed by important changes in brain activity that accompanied the threat condition: an increase of the activity in the ECN regions (lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices) along with deactivation in SN regions (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus), as in the study by Clarke and Johnstone ( ). We also found large deactivations of the superior temporal regions, suggesting attentional filtering mechanism of the aversive stimuli. When high workload was combined with the stressors, we found a pattern quite similar to those observed with the high workload, with extra activation in the ECN regions along with deactivation of the VMPFC. 

### Increased mental workload was associated with reduced performance, higher   ECN   activity, and increased autonomic response 
  
Our behavioral results indicated that increased mental workload was associated with a decrease in n‐back task accuracy and an increase in reaction times. Our extremely difficult task elicited activity in the fronto‐parietal network, including the DLPFC, the dorsal ACC, and the parietal cortex. These regions are part of the ECN (Shenhav et al.,  ), which is considered to be more activated when an individual must perform a task demanding effort, sustained attention or maintenance of information in WM, and is less activated when performing more habitual behaviors (Shenhav et al.,  ). ECN involvement has been notably reported during n‐back tasks (Jansma, Ramsey, Coppola, & Kahn,  ; Luo et al.,  ; Schmidt et al.,  ). In our study, a large recruitment of the SMA and the premotor cortex (BA 6) was also found with increased load in WM. SMA is considered to be a modality independent circuitry sustaining WM processes (Schumacher et al.,  ). This region was also markedly activated during n‐back performance in the Schmidt et al. ( ) study. Moreover, the SMA and premotor cortex have been associated with mental calculation (Hanakawa et al.,  ). In our 2‐back TNT condition, participants had to compute an exact arithmetic result to compare it with the target obtained two trials before. In the 0‐back condition that implied to compare the arithmetic result with “50,” it is likely that estimating the order of magnitude of the result was sufficient to complete the task. Accordingly, higher workload in our task resulted in increased activation of motor and ECN regions (Gruber et al.,  ), that is, an extended fronto‐parietal network. 

Besides ECN involvement, several cortical areas owning to the DMN (Fransson & Marrelec,  ; Greicius et al.,  ; Raichle et al.,  ; Ward et al.,  ) showed large deactivations in response to increased mental effort, including the medial PFC (i.e., DMPFC and VMPFC), the PCC, the ventral ACC, and the middle temporal gyrus. The DMN, active during awake rest, would be implicated in the generation of spontaneous task‐unrelated thoughts (Mason et al.,  ) whose occurrence can represent a source of internal distraction (Hinds et al.,  ). It has been shown that regions involved in the DMN could also evidence increased activity when the task is too difficult, reflecting a disengagement from the task (Buckner, Andrews‐Hanna, & Schacter,  ). Greater involvement of the DMN can thus negatively affect the performance of a demanding task (Smallwood, Beach, Schooler, & Handy,  ), including driving a vehicle (Galéra et al.,  ; He, Becic, Lee, & McCarley,  ) or flying a plane (Casner & Schooler,  ; Durantin, Dehais, & Delorme,  ). In our study, regions owning to the SN were also deactivated with task difficulty, in particular the amygdala and the insula. Taken together, our data, therefore, suggest efficient allocation of neural resources to the ECN at the expense of the DMN and the SN, that is, efficient brain mechanisms to perform the complex 2‐back task. 

Regarding autonomic measures, heart rate and pupil diameter were increased during the 2‐back condition, indicating physiological arousal with a shift of the balance of the autonomic nervous system toward a sympathetic dominance (Simpson et al.,  ). High workload activated the dorsal brainstem, which may reflect additional locus coeruleus (LC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) nuclei involvement. LC and VTA phasic response may have induced transient increases in catecholamine levels, thereby enhancing DLPFC activity and facilitating executive and WM processes to maintain performance to respond to increased task difficulty (Arnsten,  ; Sara,  ; Yuen et al.,  ). In addition, an increase of catecholamine brain levels induces stimulation of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system (Sara & Bouret,  ). Our observation of higher heart rate and pupil size in the 2‐back trials is therefore consistent with phasic catecholamine release. 


### Task performance was preserved despite the stressors:   SN   disengagement and inhibition of the auditory processing 
  
The threat condition resulted in significantly higher anxiety ratings, although it did not elicit significant behavioral or autonomic modifications. Preservation of performance under stressors in our complex WM task is coherent with several previous studies that have used single‐letter‐ or digit‐n‐back tasks (Clarke & Johnstone,  ; Cousijn et al.,  ; Duncko et al.,  ; Porcelli et al.,  ; Qin et al.,  ) as well as similar highly demanding WM task (Mandrick et al.,  ). Our neuroimaging results suggest that maintaining performance under stress induction was likely conditioned by additional allocation of neural resources within the ECN toward the cognitive task (Eysenck & Calvo,  ; Mandrick et al.,  ), inhibition of the STG to reduce auditory stressor processing, and inhibition of limbic regions of the SN for emotional regulation. 

The threat condition was dominated by significant deactivations in the STG and cuneus, extending to the posterior cingulate gyrus. Deactivations were also observed in the dorsal and ventral medial PFC, the ACC, the insula and the amygdala. Deactivation of the STG most certainly reflects inhibition of auditory processing during the expectation of aversive loud sounds. Deactivation of brain regions has been probably under‐considered in the past because of the inclination to deal primarily with the neural activation effects induced by stimulation, rather than with any possible decrements in neural activity. Yet, it is well known that humans have the capacity to selectively enhance or inhibit sensory brain regions via top‐down attentional mechanisms (Mozolic et al.,  ). Our result may thus be interpreted in several ways. First, the focal task (i.e., the TNT) may have consumed most attentional resources, provoking a reduced distractor effect (Hu, Bauer, Padmala, & Pessoa,  ) since attention was shifted away from the aversive auditory stimuli (Pessoa, McKenna, Gutierrez, & Ungerleider,  ). Consequently, less attention was paid to “expect” and to process the sounds. An additional and more cognitively active explanation is that inhibition of auditory processing may have contributed to filter the unwanted noises. Interestingly, top‐down inhibitory mechanisms have been proposed to explain the attenuation of unpleasant sounds in the context of tinnitus habituation (Rauschecker, Leaver, & Mühlau,  ). Such selective sensory inhibition is thought to take place over long periods of time and following repetitive aversive stimulation. Although this long‐term neural adaptation could not occur in our experiment, it is possible that similar initial control mechanisms helped to protect from its stressful effects. Note, however, that the useful deactivations of large temporal regions are to be interpreted within a specific context, since “ignoring” a stressful stimulus is not always a good strategy. When extreme, this phenomenon has been described as inattentional deafness and is subtended by inhibitory brain mechanisms of the auditory processing (Dehais, Roy, & Scannella,  ; Giraudet, St‐Louis, Scannella, & Causse,  ). While it may be useful when the aversive auditory stimulus is an unwanted disturbance, it becomes dangerous when it is a security alarm that is ignored. This points to the complexity of using physiological measures to assist the operator, and the need to go deeper into the understanding of these mechanisms. 

Furthermore, several regions of the SN (and in particular the VMPFC, anterior insula, and amygdala) were deactivated during the threat condition, as observed in other studies (Clarke & Johnstone,  ; Pruessner et al.,  ; Simpson et al.,  ), suggesting implication of emotional regulation mechanisms during threat. Consistent with the latter interpretation, the functional connectivity between dorsal prefrontal/parietal regions and amygdala was increased during the threat condition. In rodents, the MPFC and amygdala have a major role in stress‐related behaviors, and MPFC has an important role in the regulation of amygdala response to emotional stimuli (Andolina, Maran, Valzania, Conversi, & Puglisi‐Allegra,  ). Such regulation mechanisms through top‐down control exerted by the PFC on the amygdala have been reported in humans, during concurrent cognitive and emotional tasks (Loos et al.,  ; for review see Okon‐Singer, Hendler, Pessoa, & Shackman,  ). Consistently, our functional connectivity results suggest that, in our experiment, top‐down control on SN regions may have occurred during threat of stressors. In particular, the deactivation of the anterior insula may explain the absence of visible effects of the threat condition on heart rate and pupil size measures, despite self‐report of increased anxiety. 

When stressors were concomitant with high workload, performance remained preserved. We observed that deactivation of the VMPFC was greater (i.e., negative interaction effect). Therefore, deactivation of this region may be critical for optimal cognitive performance when facing both high load context and the threat of stressors. Bilateral hippocampus deactivations can be also linked to decreased activity in the SN. Previous studies found that the SN plays a critical role in mediating the interaction between emotion perception and executive control (Luo et al.,  ). Moreover, we observed supplementary activity in the SMA, in the DLPFC, as well as in the left parietal cortex (i.e., positive interaction effect). These regions were also implicated in the TNT performance in the safe condition. This increased brain activity in task related regions suggests that additional cognitive resources were engaged to preserve performance. Similar increases of activity in the ECN regions under stressors were found in previous studies (Clarke & Johnstone,  ; Porcelli et al.,  ) and arithmetic tasks (Dedovic et al.,  ). 

Interestingly, we found that activity in dorsal medial and lateral PFC regions was related with pupil dilation under stress induction. Pupil dilation dynamics has been closely associated with LC activity (both tonic and phasic, Joshi, Li, Kalwani, & Gold,  ) and may be a reliable proxy measure of norepinephrine (NE) release and sympathetic involvement. Activity in the dorsal frontal gyrus was found to be related with pupil size during rest (DiNuzzo et al.,  ), thus reflecting variations of tonic NE brain levels. Therefore, in our study, pupil dilation likely indexed the increased activity in the dorsal PFC regions implicated in the cognitive task and enhanced under the threat of the stressors, as a result of a tonic increase in brain catecholamines. 

Altogether, our results showed that facing high load context and the threat of stressors could be characterized by a specific pattern of PFC activity. Increased activation of the ECN would play a role for the maintenance of cognitive performance, while diminishing sensory processing. This would be explained by exhaustion of attentional resources or inhibition, that helped modulating the impact of the auditory stressors. Without being contradictory to these mechanisms, successful preservation of performance may have been possible in our experiment since actual stress level was probably relatively moderate, as inferred from anxiety ratings (i.e., 5.10 in the “2‐back threat” condition, on a 0–10 scale) and the lack of increased sympathetic activity, in particular the heart rate that is known to be sensitive to acute stress (Yao et al.,  ). It has been shown that passive exposure to loud aversive sounds induces significant activations in the SN and dorsal brainstem, thus clearly evidencing a marked stress response (Zald & Pardo,  ). However, the threat of intermittent aversive sounds, as used in our study, may have been less stressful than direct exposure to permanent sounds, but we aimed at eliminating possible distraction effects. One must acknowledge that despite the subjective and neuroimaging results that suggest efficient cognitive strategies, the lack of behavioral and physiological effects of the stressor can raise a doubt on the effectiveness of the stress manipulation. Indeed, an intense level of stress would have probably provoked an increased level of emotional arousal indexed by a heightened autonomic nervous system activity. We can also postulate that a more efficient and intense stressor would have degraded task performance and elicited different patterns of brain activations, in particular with the recruitment of regions pertaining to the SN. 


### How far do we need to go to observe cognitive disengagement? 
  
Compared with previous studies on concomitant cognitive task and acute stress, our primary goal was to increase the mental effort with a task that combined WM and mental calculation, two cognitive processes that rely on the ECN. We did not observe a drop of performance or a decrease in ECN function when combined with stress. There are three ways to induce cognitive disengagement in such experimental design: increasing the load, increasing the stress or increasing both of them. The increase of the cognitive load is limited: the task would have to be hardly feasible without stress and become unfeasible when stress is administered. We think that this ceiling of difficulty might have been reached with the very difficult TNT. However, participants did adapt with the threat of aversive sounds, and performance at the task was similar with and without stress. Increasing the level or changing the nature of stress, may therefore, in this context, be the solution. Given the mentioned low efficiency (and possibly zero efficiency in some participants) of the threat of aversive sounds, for future experiments, we would suggest turning to other types of stressors. For example, psychosocial stress is difficult to filter out, contrarily to auditory stressors, and have been proven to reduce performance (Jiang & Rau,  ; Schoofs et al.,  ). These scenarios are not easy to implement in an fMRI experiment because to be efficient, they must be very realistic. This would be however a great challenge and an interesting path that may well fit with the high levels of stress that airplane pilots experience due to high hierarchical pressure, huge financial outcomes, and even life and death responsibility. 

It is also important to note that experimental 2 × 2 designs combining factors of workload and stress, such as used in our and others' studies (Clarke & Johnstone,  ; Cousijn et al.,  ; Duncko et al.,  ; Jiang & Rau,  ; Porcelli et al.,  ; Qin et al.,  ; Schoofs et al.,  ), remain approximate to selectively point out effects of stress on cognition. Indeed, cognitive task difficulty itself can induce acute stress. In our study, both levels of subjective difficulty and anxiety were increased by higher task load, and one might argue that task‐related stress might have participated in the observed shift toward sympathetic dominance. Indeed, increased workload in a challenging task can elicit a mixture of mental workload and acute stress since the task can be emotionally challenging (Parent et al.,  ). Raised anxiety related to task performance was evidenced by Simpson et al. ( ). The authors assumed that anxiety is a likely accompaniment of most demanding cognitive tasks conducted in a laboratory or imaging settings, especially during naïve task performance. As a consequence, areas of the brain concerned with emotion may change in concert with those more directly concerned with the cognitive aspects of the tasks. However, in our study, brain regions related to the 2‐back condition largely suggest that task‐related stress remained moderate as no clear activation of the SN was evidenced. Conversely, the opposite pattern was observed, that is, deactivation of the SN. 


### Perspectives for neuroergonomics 
  
Complex and safety‐critical activities such as piloting can lead to an increase of both mental workload and acute stress, whose effects can engender poor cognitive performance, bad decisions (Maier, Makwana, & Hare,  ), and eventually accidents. In this context, the maintenance of optimal cognitive performance is a constant challenge. Here we observed that high load context and the threat of stressors may be overcome thanks to compensatory mechanisms. The balance of high activity in the ECN combined with reduced activity in the SN and the DMN were markers of efficient brain mechanisms and preserved performance. Conversely, with more load and more intense stress, the disruption of this balance may be used as a marker of cognitive disengagement and disability to appropriately face an emergency. As in situ measurements of mental workload are expanding rapidly with the development of field‐deployable neuroimaging tools like functional Near‐Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), caution must be taken, especially when safety‐related decisions are supported by physiological objective measurements. Our results confirmed that increased activity in the DLPFC, belonging to the dorsal fronto‐parietal network, successfully indexed effortful (but efficient) mental activity. This effortful mental activity was accompanied by a reduction of the DMN activations, including the DMPFC. During combined high workload and threat of stressors, greater deactivations were observed in the VMPFC. Using frontal fNIRS, the DLPFC/medial PFC cerebral blood flow ratio could thus efficiently index mental workload and emotional regulation. 

Regarding autonomic measures, increased heart rate and pupil diameter in the more demanding task confirmed that variations in heart rate and pupil diameter can be reliable indexes of mental workload during task performance. This is consistent with a large body of literature (Kahneman & Beatty,  ; Shine et al.,  ; van der Wel & van Steenbergen,  ), including studies addressing critical domains like piloting (Peysakhovich et al.,  ; Roscoe,  ; Wilson,  ). Among promising applications, we can cite the evaluation of systems during the certification process via the objective evaluation of the mental workload and stress they can generate, adaptive automation (Byrne & Parasuraman,  ), crew monitoring in the cockpit, or driver monitoring in autonomous vehicles. 



## CONCLUSION 
  
Our results have highlighted the cerebral and physiological signature of high mental workload and threat of auditory stressors. Mental workload was characterized by a marked activation of the ECN along with disengagement of the DMN and SN. Cardiovascular activity and pupillary diameter were good indicators of mental workload, with possible links between pupil diameter variations and superior frontal activity. Threat of auditory stressors did not result in changes in autonomic activity or task performance but increased recruitment of task‐related regions (in particular the ECN, with lateral prefrontal and parietal regions, as well as the SMA), decreased activation of the medial PFC, and deactivation of auditory and SN regions were observed, suggesting adaptive brain mechanisms to focus on the task and inhibit processing of the stressors and regulate emotion. During concomitant high workload and stressors, we observed a similar pattern with higher recruitment of task‐related regions and decreased activation of the medial PFC. 

Our results critically underline that extra recruitment of task‐related regions, in particular in the lateral prefrontal and parietal regions, and a pattern of PFC activations/deactivations, that is, increased lateral PFC and decreased medial PFC activity, may represent a relevant marker of preserved performance and successful management of both high load and threat of stressors. We can however assume that stress levels were moderate in our experiment and more intense stress may have finally resulted in different patterns of activations and a performance decrement.

# Abstract
 
Most of our knowledge on the human neural bases of spatial updating comes from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in which recumbent participants moved in virtual environments. As a result, little is known about the dynamic of spatial updating during real body motion. Here, we exploited the high temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the dynamics of cortical activation in a spatial updating task where participants had to remember their initial orientation while they were passively rotated about their vertical axis in the dark. After the rotations, the participants pointed toward their initial orientation. We contrasted the EEG signals with those recorded in a control condition in which participants had no cognitive task to perform during body rotations. We found that the amplitude of the P N  complex of the rotation-evoked potential (RotEPs) (recorded over the vertex) was significantly greater in the Updating task. The analyses of the cortical current in the source space revealed that the main significant task-related cortical activities started during the N P  interval (136–303 ms after rotation onset). They were essentially localized in the temporal and frontal (supplementary motor complex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior prefrontal cortex) regions. During this time-window, the right superior posterior parietal cortex (PPC) also showed significant task-related activities. The increased activation of the PPC became bilateral over the P N  component (303–470 ms after rotation onset). In this late interval, the cuneus and precuneus started to show significant task-related activities. Together, the present results are consistent with the general scheme that the first task-related cortical activities during spatial updating are related to the encoding of spatial goals and to the storing of spatial information in working memory. These activities would precede those involved in higher order processes also relevant for updating body orientation during rotations linked to the egocentric and visual representations of the environment.

## Introduction 
  
The capacity to keep track of our position in the environment is paramount when moving around. This cognitive skill is generally referred to as spatial navigation. In humans, large advances on the neural bases of spatial navigation were obtained by measuring the cerebral blood flow, with fMRI scanners, of recumbent participants virtually moving in visual environments. Studies employing these techniques have revealed a consistent set of cortical activations during spatial navigation ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Increased activations were found in areas responding to visual stimuli (striate and extrastriate visual areas), and in regions not strictly involved in visual processing yet having important higher-order functions for spatial navigation. These regions include the PPC, the temporal (TC) and frontal cortices which contribute, in varying degrees, to working memory, space perception and spatial representations. 

The dynamics of the neural network underlying spatial navigation uncovered by fMRI studies is largely unknown. This is notably due to the hemodynamic response time ( ) which is too slow with respect to the speed of the processes engaged during spatial navigation (e.g., <1.5 s for simple spatial updating tasks,  ;  ;  ). One can reasonably expect that the dynamics are conditioned, to some extent, by the functions of the different elements comprising the engaged network. For instance, early and sustained activation could be found in the areas which contribute to maintaining spatial information in short-term working memory [e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), see  ;  ] and to processing external spatial information, such as goal destination [e.g., anterior PFC (aPFC), see  ;  ;  ; TC, see  ;  ]. On the other hand, later activations are to be expected in regions involved in higher cognitive processes. This could be the case for the regions that contribute to the building of egocentric and allocentric frames of reference, respectively allowing individuals to either encode the environment relative to themselves (e.g., precuneus,  ) or to encode their position relative to the environment [e.g., lateral occipital cortex (LOC),  ;  ]. 

Electroencephalography (EEG), with its excellent temporal resolution and the possibility to increase its spatial resolution using source analyses techniques ( ;  ,  ), appears well adapted to capture the time course of spatial navigation ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, the use of EEG also enables the investigation of brain activity in moving participants, i.e., where vestibular inputs provide the brain with critical body motions information for spatial navigation ( ;  ;  ; see  , for a review). 

 and   recently used EEG to record cortical activities of participants who had to retain the location of a peripheral target during passive whole-body motion in the dark (see  , for a review). Investigating these activities in such spatial updating task can be thought of as a valuable entry point for getting insight into the cortical implementation of spatial navigation. Performed relatively well in darkness (see  ;  , for reviews), even in extreme cases of somatosensory deafferentation ( ), such tasks involve vestibular information processing.   and   found a large alpha power decrease in electrodes overlaying the PPC during spatial updating. Interestingly, the decreased alpha power was always located in the contralateral hemisphere to the memorized target and switched hemisphere when the unseen target changed visual hemifield during body motion. Reflecting enhanced cortical excitability ( ;  ), the decrease of alpha power observed during the actual body motion provided human electrophysiological evidence that the PPC is involved in spatial updating ( ;  ;  ;  ) and in directing attention to locations or objects in the environment ( ). 

Apart from the PPC, no other region of the spatial navigation network revealed by human fMRI investigations (see above) showed task-related neural oscillations in   and   studies. This could be due to the fact that the EEG spectral content was examined in the electrode space (scalp level) rather than in the sources space. By partially de-convolving the EEG data in a physically and anatomically meaningful way, source space analyses may indeed reveal effects that remain undetected at the scalp level with electrode space analyses ( ;  ). 

The goal of the present study was twofold: to analyze the cortical network involved in spatial updating during actual whole-body motion in the dark, and to obtain insight into the dynamics of this network. We performed source analyses of the EEG activity recorded while human participants were maintaining their initial orientation in memory while being rotated in darkness. The dynamics of the early stage of spatial updating (i.e., before predominance of processes related to the use of the updated spatial representation) was assessed by computing the current amplitude over the cortical surface in three consecutive time windows. These were defined by the negative and positive deflection points of the rotation evoked potential (RotEPs) recorded over the vertex. We predicted that the first task-related activations should be observed in areas involved in the short-term spatial working memory (e.g., dlPFC;  ) and the online spatial updating processes (e.g., PPC;  ;  ;  ). Later activations should be observed in regions involved in the egocentric encoding of spatial positions (e.g., precuneus,  ). 


## Materials and Methods 
  
The data were collected in a previous study ( ). In this study, we specifically investigated the cortical activation associated with the planning of pointing movements whose targets were defined by idiothetic information issued from body rotations in the dark. This activation was assessed from the end of the rotation to the onset of the pointing movements (i.e., movement planning process). In the present study, we investigated the dynamics of cortical activation during the actual body motion (i.e., spatial updating process). 

### Participants 
  
Ten healthy right-handed participants (three women, mean age: 26.6 ± 2.7 years) participated in the experiment. They all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and did not report any history of neural disorders. The data of one male participant had to be discarded because of technical problems. The experiment was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (except for registration in a database) and was approved by the Laval University Biomedical Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained prior to the experiment. 


### Experimental Set-Up 
  
The participants were seated in a dark room with their feet resting on a footstool. They were secured to the chair with a four-point belt. The chair could be manually rotated about its vertical axis by the experimenter. The rotations were recorded with an optical encoder at 1 kHz. A circular array of LEDs fixed on the floor behind the chair indicated its initial angular position and the three targets rotations (i.e., 20°, 30° and 40° in the counterclockwise direction). A light emitted by a laser diode fixed on the back of the chair provided the experimenter with visual feedback about the chair orientation along the LEDs array. The use of different rotation amplitudes together with the variability in the actual body rotation (e.g., acceleration, amplitude) for a given rotation target amplitude increased the necessity for the participants to direct their attention on information related to self-rotation to keep track of their initial orientation. Similar set-ups have frequently been used for testing vestibular-related processes (e.g.,  ,  ;  ;  ;  ). Importantly, the choice of manual rotations reduced the possibility of electric noise contamination of the EEG recordings (see   for a discussion on this issue). 


### Experimental Tasks 
  
#### Updating 
  
Before the start of each trial, participants positioned their right hand on their ipsilateral knee and gazed at a chair-fixed LED positioned ∼1 m in front of them. They were instructed to keep fixating this LED during the whole duration of the trials. The participants received the preparation signal “ready” 2–3 s before either the 20°, 30°, or 40° floor LED lit up behind the chair to indicate, to the experimenter, the amplitude of the next rotation. Some 100 ms after the end of the rotation, a beep indicated to the participants to produce a rapid lateral arm movement to point toward their pre-rotation, initial, orientation. The signal from the chair optical encoder was used to detect online the end of the rotation which was defined as angular velocity smaller than 2.5°/s. The buzzer emitting the beep was located directly above the participants, along their longitudinal axis. This prevented the sound from providing spatial information (e.g., initial orientation). The participants were returned to the starting position after their pointing response and the next trial started following a minimum resting time of 15 s. Results related to the motor performance have been published separately ( ). Briefly, the burst of the arm muscular activities triggering the pointing movements occurred ∼400 ms after the imperative signal (beep) and the amplitude of the movements was scaled according to the amplitude of the body rotations. These behavioral results prove that the participants attempted to remember their initial orientation while they were passively rotated. They also indicate that spatial updating was fast and attuned to the actual body rotation in space. 


#### Control 
  
We performed a second experimental block of trials like those performed in the Updating task, but with the only distinction that the participants did not produce arm movement when hearing the beep after the rotation offset. For these trials, the instruction was simply to keep ocular fixation on the chair-fixed LED during the rotations. This block of trials was used to normalize EEG activities recorded in the Updating task. As the dynamics of the body rotations were similar in both the Updating and Control tasks, as it will be demonstrated below, this normalization (also detailed below) allowed EEG activities that are not strictly related to spatial updating to be to canceled out (see  ). These activities might result for instance from eye movements, and from somatosensory (see  ) stimulation during body rotations. Note, however, that important activities for spatial updating could also be present in both the Updating and Control tasks. This could be the case for activities related to vestibular stimulation and to activities where attention is directed toward self-motion information. 

Participants were submitted to 25 rotations for each angular target for a total of 75 trials in each task (i.e., Updating and Control). The order of rotation amplitude was pseudo-randomly selected and the presentation order of the tasks was counterbalanced across participants. 

On average (Control and Updating tasks), the rotation amplitudes were 19.81 ± 0.83°, 29.67 ± 0.96°, and 40.53 ± 0.94° for the 20°, 30°, and 40° rotation tasks, respectively (see  ). To verify if participants experienced similar idiothetic information between the Updating and Control tasks, we compared chair angular acceleration between both tasks. To make this test, we first normalized the time-series of angular acceleration from start (0%) to end (100%); using an angular velocity threshold of 2.5°/s to identify beginning and ending of rotation. Then, for each chair rotation amplitude (i.e., 20°, 30°, 40°), we performed a two-tailed paired   t  -test using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analyses. SPM uses random field theory to adjust for multiple comparisons. It enables comparison of continuous variables at time points other than discrete local optima ( ). This statistical approach is suited to analyzing time-series where each sample is dependent on previous data points, as for acceleration data. For each rotation amplitude, results of the statistical tests revealed that the time-series acceleration did not significantly differ between the Updating and Control tasks (all   P  s < 0.05;  ). These results suggest that if the dynamics of cortical activities differed between the Updating and Control tasks, this difference more likely would result from a difference between the cortical processes engaged within the tasks than from different idiothetic information.

### Electroencephalographic Analyses 
  
Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded using a Geodesic 64-channel EEG sensor net (1000 Hz, Electrical Geodesics Inc., Eugene, United States). This electrode density is considered appropriate for electrophysiological source imaging ( ). Data pre-processing was performed using BrainVision Analyzer 2 (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). The recordings were first referenced to the averaged activity of the 64 scalp electrodes. Then, data recorded by all electrodes were synchronized with respect to the onset of the rotation (i.e., when chair angular velocity > 2.5°/s), with the average amplitude of the 200-ms pre-rotation epoch serving as baseline. The signals were band-passed filtered (0.5–45 Hz) and independent component analyses (ICA) were used to subtract ocular artifacts (e.g., blinks, saccades) from the EEG recordings. The recordings were visually inspected and epochs still presenting artifacts were rejected. The data were separately averaged for each participant, task, target body angular rotation amplitude (i.e., 20°, 30°, 40°) and electrode. These averages were used to estimate the sources of the cortical activities. 

The cortical sources were reconstructed using Brainstorm software ( , freely available at  ). We employed the minimum-norm technique to resolve the inverse problem with unconstrained dipole orientations. The forward models were computed using a boundary element method (symmetric BEM,  ) on the anatomical MRI Colin 27 brain template, a predominant volume conductor model from the Montreal Neurological Institute. We used a BEM model with three realistic layers (scalp, inner skull, and outer skull) which provides more accurate solution than a simple three concentric spheres model ( ). To enhance the spatial resolution of the brain template, we used a high number of vertices (i.e., 306,716 vertices). Such source reconstruction of EEG data has proved to be suited for investigating the activity of outer and inner cortical surfaces ( ;  ). 

Consistent with previous studies ( ;  ;  ), RotEPs were found over a large set of electrodes, but were largest over the Cz electrode (i.e., vertex). As shown in   (left column: averaged RotEP; right column: individual RotEP), the RotEPs were composed of successive inflection points which we refer to as P  (overall mean 47 ± 12 ms), N  (136 ± 12 ms), P  (303 ± 35 ms), and N  (470 ± 55 ms). These points served as temporal landmarks for analyzing the dynamic of the cortical activities in the source space. 
  
Data related to the rotation evoked potentials (RotEP). (Left column) Grand average RotEP traces at electrode Cz (i.e., vertex) in the Updating and Control conditions for the 20°, 30°, and 40° body rotations. The shaded areas represent the standard deviation of the means (positive and negative, for the Updating and Control conditions, respectively). The averages were obtained after synchronizing the traces with respect to N . Overall mean peak latencies: P : 47 ± 12 ms; N : 136 ± 12 ms; P : 303 ± 35; N : 470 ± 55 ms. (Right column) Individual RotEP of all participants in the Updating and Control conditions, for the 20°, 30°, and 40° body rotations. 
  
For each participant, rotation amplitude and task, we measured the latency of each RotEP’s inflection point and then averaged the current computed in the source space over three successive time windows: P N , N P , and P N . Following this step, we collapsed (by averaging) the maps obtained for each amplitude of rotations to obtain a single map of current amplitude per participant and task. Following trial rejections, the averaged current maps were built using an average number of trials of 61.33 and 63.22 for the Updating and Control conditions, respectively. It should be noted that this method for estimating EEG sources is not impacted by potential effects of rotation amplitudes, task or inter-individual differences on RotEPs peak latencies. Computed in the source space, current amplitude is considered to reflect brain activation ( ,  ). The last RotEP peak considered in the Updating task (i.e., N ) occurred on average 171, 269, and 326 ms before the end of the 20°, 30° and 40° rotations. Thus, different cortical activations between the Updating and Control tasks would likely be more related to spatial updating than to the preparation of the arm motor commands in the Updating task. 

To highlight those cortical regions specifically involved in spatial updating, we computed statistical maps by contrasting the current maps (i.e., each vertice) obtained in the Updating and Control tasks using   t  -tests (significance threshold   p   < 0.05, uncorrected). These analyses were performed separately for each time windows (i.e., P N : short latency, N P : mid-latency and P N : long latency) to gain insight into the spatio-temporal dynamics of the cortical activities during spatial updating. Sources were identified according to Brodmann’s areas after converting MNI to Talairach coordinates with the Non-linear Yale MNI to Talairach Conversion Algorithm ( ). The Brodmann’s areas definition was based on  . 

The amplitude of the cortical potentials increases when they are evoked by task-relevant somatosensory ( ;  ) or visual ( ) events. In the present study, extracting the RotEPs out of the EEG recordings allowed us to determine if this effect generalized to cortical responses evoked by idiothetic information relevant for spatial updating. To this end, we compared the amplitude of the P N , N P , and P N  components between the Updating and Control tasks. We also compared between these tasks, the latency of the RotEPs, which was defined as the time elapsed between the onset of the body rotation and P . Variables related to the RotEP were submitted to separate 2 (Task: Updating, Control) by 3 (Amplitude: 20°, 30°, 40°) repeated-measures ANOVAs (significance threshold   p   < 0.05). Prior tests (Kolmogorov–Smirnov) confirmed the normality of all data. 



## Results 
  
### Rotation-Evoked Potentials 
  
The ANOVA revealed a significant effect of Task on P N  component amplitude ( ). The amplitude of this first Rotation-Evoked Potentials (RotEP) component was greater in the Updating than in the Control task (8.83 ± 3.18 mV vs. 7.76 ± 3.14 mV,   F   = 5.66,   p   = 0.04;   = 0.44). The analyses did not reveal significant effect of rotation Amplitude (  p   = 0.38) or significant interaction of Task × rotation Amplitude (  p   = 0.09). The experimental tasks did not have significant effect on the other RotEP components (i.e., N P :   p   = 0.56; P N :   p   = 0.09).

The latency of the RotEPs (i.e., P , mean 47 ± 12 ms) was not significantly different between the Updating and Control tasks (  p   = 0.64) or between the different rotation amplitudes (  p   = 0.60). The interaction Task × rotation Amplitude was also not significant (  p   = 0.19).

The mean current measured over the P N  interval, that is, between 47 and 136 ms after rotation onset, was strikingly alike between the Updating and Control tasks. The statistical map indicated that the cortical activity did not significantly differ between both tasks except for small areas of the left PPC and left LOC (see  ). In these areas, the activity was smaller in the Updating than in the Control task. 

Extensive differences in cortical current between both tasks emerged, however, in the second RotEP component (N P , between 130 and 303 ms after rotation onset). Overall, the cortical activity increased when participants tracked their initial position during the body rotations (see  ). Significant task-related activities were mainly source-localized in the frontal and temporal cortices. Specifically, the supplementary motor complex (SMC), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFC), and the right anterior prefrontal cortex all showed greater activation in the Updating than in the Control tasks. Significantly greater current in the Updating task was also found in the right TC and in both medial TC, and in a small area of the right PPC. Only sparse regions of the LOC showed greater activation in the Control task than in the Updating task. 

The increased activation observed in the Updating task during the N P  interval persisted in several cortical regions during the last RotEP component (P N , between 303 and 470 ms after rotation onset). This was the case for the bilateral dlPFC, SMC, medial TC, and for the right PPC (see  ). Other regions showed significant task-related activities exclusively in this last analyzed interval of the RotEP. These regions were the right dorsal premotor areas, the left and right cuneus, the left precuneus, and the left PPC. Increased in the Updating task during N P , the activity of the right temporal lobe was no longer altered by the spatial updating processes during P N . The left LOC continued to exhibit greater activities in the Control task. 

It is of note that the motor cortex contralateral to the arm used by the participants to point toward the home position after rotation did not show significant activity in any of the three analyzed intervals. This suggests that the increased activation observed in the present Updating task was more related to spatial updating than to motor preparation   per se  . 



## Discussion 
  
The present study was designed to gain insight into the dynamics of the cortical activations underpinning spatial updating during body motions. We used a protocol in which seated participants indicated their initial orientation after being passively rotated by different amplitudes in the dark. By contrasting, in successive time windows, the EEG activity recorded during body rotations from the EEG activity recorded in a baseline control task, we were able to isolate a discrete set of cortical areas involved in spatial updating processes and appraised their dynamics. 

### The Early Processing of Rotation-Related Cues Is Largely Independent of the Spatial Updating 
  
As a first salient finding, the current measured in the source space remained largely similar between the Updating and Control tasks over the first component of the RotEPs, a period spanning 47–136 ms after body rotation onset. The only significant effect revealed by the statistical map during this interval was a smaller activation in the Updating task in a few vertices of the left PPC and LOC. This effect persisted at both mid- and long latencies only for the LOC. The narrowness of the regions showing this trend raises the question of the robustness of this finding. Note, however, that the LOC contributes to the allocentric coding of space ( ;  ;  ). Hence, the smaller activity observed in the LOC during the Updating task may have hampered the use of this frame of reference for encoding home position during body rotations. This could have indirectly enhanced the use of an egocentric frame of reference, which appeared more relevant in the present Updating task performed in the dark. 

The absence of large task-related activation during P N  suggests that the first wave of idiothetic cue processing during the body rotations was not strictly linked to spatial updating. Yet, despite their non-specific nature, brain processes during the early phase of the rotations most certainly remained critical for spatial updating. This could be the case of the processes associated to vestibular inputs, which are the main carrier of body motion information during passive displacements in the dark ( ). 

The scarcity of early task-related activation was somewhat unexpected given that overt and covert attention influences neural activities related to the early processing of sensory cues (<100 ms;  ;  ). One explanation for the lack of different cortical activations between the Updating and Control tasks may be that participants also directed their attention toward self-motion information in the latter task. This could have helped them to keep fixation on the chair-fixed LED during the rotations. 


### Evidence of Processes Related to Spatial Working Memory and Spatial Updating at Mid-Latencies 
  
Large significant task-related activities emerged during the second RotEP component (i.e., N P , 136–303 ms after rotation onset). These activities were source-localized in a large network comprised mainly of the frontal, temporal and parietal regions. Like most task-related activities observed in the present study, the current measured in these regions were greater in the Updating than in the Control tasks. 

The dlPFC and mPFC showed increased activations in the Updating task. The increased activations in these frontal areas could be associated to important executive functions for spatial processes. Their roles in maintaining spatial information in short-term working memory, and in the cognitive manipulation of information from the environment that is out of view ( ;  ) could have been relevant in the present study for keeping track of the original orientation during entire body rotations. The persistence, in the last analyzed interval, of the strong activity of the dlPFC and mPFC in the Updating task is consistent with this suggestion. 

On the other hand, the task-related activations observed in the aPFC and TC at both mid- and long latencies could be linked to the online processing of home direction during rotations. This interpretation is supported both by human studies showing that the aPFC is crucial to encoding spatial information about goals ( ;  ;  ; see   for similar evidence in rodents) and by those reporting that the activities of the medial temporal lobe dynamically change according to the current Euclidean distance of the spatial goal during navigation ( ;  ;  ;  ). Together, the sustained activation observed in the prefrontal and temporal regions while participants were passively rotated could have then contributed to the maintenance of home orientation in working memory and in the encoding of its angular distance for use in the upcoming goal-directed pointing movements. 

We also found significant increased activities in the Updating task in the right superior PPC during N P  which became bilateral during P N . These results were to be expected given the well-recognized importance of the superior PPC for spatial processes, including those specifically linked to the updating of spatial representations during movements ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The activity of the PPC could have contributed to estimating the angle of home position during and after body rotation ( ;  ; see   for a review), which was an important egocentric process for planning the pointing movement. 

The increased activation observed in the superior PPC could also be related to the maintenance of spatial attention (see  , for a review), which is a critical cognitive process for spatial updating. It should be noted that our observation that the increased activity in the right PPC preceded the increased activity over the left PPC is consistent with studies suggesting a right-hemispheric dominance for visual processes and remapping ( ;  ;  ). 

The SMC was the last region where significant task-dependent activities were observed at mid-latencies. These increased activities also lasted until the final analysis time window (i.e., P N ). The SMC comprises the supplementary motor area (SMA), the supplementary eye fields (SEF) and the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) ( ). The SEF might have played a crucial role in the Updating task. This is suggested by studies showing that lesions affecting the SEF impair the accuracy of saccades toward a memorized visual target only if the patients are rotated before triggering the saccade ( ,  ). The SEF was first considered as an oculomotor area ( ). Studies in Monkey, however, have identified a large population of SEF neurons that increase their activities during arm movements (40% of 337 neurons in  ; 42% of 106 neurons in  ). These arm-related cells provide grounds for a plausible contribution of the SEF to providing relevant spatial information in the present study for pointing, after the rotations, toward the original body orientation. 


### Long-Latency Activities During Spatial Updating Could Be Linked to Spatial Representations 
  
Bilateral increased activations were observed at long-latency (P N ) in the cuneus, which is part of the medial visual cortex. In the present study, the only available visual input was a chair-fixed LED which the participants fixated throughout the trials. Because this visual input was present in both tasks, the contrast of Updating and Control tasks most likely canceled out the neural activity evoked by the LED fixation. This possibility is well supported by the fact that the latency of the task-related activity observed in the cuneus (>300 ms) was much longer than the latency of visual-evoked potentials recorded in occipital lobe either by EEG or magnetoencephalography (<80 ms,  ;  ;  ). More likely, the late activity of the visual cortex may have resulted from non-visual top-down signals (mediated for instance by parietal or frontal regions,  ). This could have enabled the use of a visual-like representation to encode initial direction during the rotation, perhaps through visual mental imagery (see  ;  ). The fact that visual mental imagery activates the earliest visual cortex (BA 17 and 18) ( ) affords this possibility. 

It is interesting to note that the task-related activities observed in the medial surface of the left PPC (i.e., precuneus) at long latencies are consistent with the use of an egocentric frame of reference for encoding home position ( ;  ;  ). Based on idiothetic and gaze direction cues ( ;  ), this frame of reference appears most relevant in the present spatial task for updating body orientation during rotations in the dark. The egocentric spatial information contained in the precuneus would serve in contexts with body displacement but not for the mere egocentric judgments of objects location in steady body conditions ( ). We noted that the increased activation of the precuneus observed in the Updating task was left lateralized. This lateralization was also found by   when using searchlight analysis to characterize neural activity in an fMRI navigation study, but not in their follow-up analyses using a more liberal threshold. Bilateral activation of the precuneus was also observed in the   fMRI study when participants indicated the position of memorized objects following self-displacements in virtual environments. Note, however, that the low temporal resolution of fMRI scanners does not allow to determine whether activations in both hemispheres occur simultaneously. The results of the present EEG study may suggest that processes related to egocentric representations may have shorter latencies in the left than in the right precuneus, especially when encoding spatial positions from the contralateral visual hemifield. 

Dorsal motor areas of the frontal lobe were strongly activated in the last analyzed rotation interval of the Updating task. These areas have direct connections with spinal motor neurons ( ). Importantly, however, we found that the increased activations in the dorsal motor areas were circumscribed to the right hemisphere, which was ipsilateral to the pointing arm. Although a fraction of ipsilateral connections reaches the spinal level ( ), the absence of significant task-related activities in the contralateral dorsal motor areas suggests that the functions linked to their activations were more cognitive than motoric in nature. The marked activities found in the right dPMC in the Updating task is consistent with studies showing evidence of functional hemispheric differences between the left and right dPMC, with a salience for the right dPMC for spatial working memory processes ( ;  ). The dPMC could have beneficiated from inputs sent by prefrontal areas which showed task-related activities with shorter latencies (136–303 ms vs. 303–470 ms after rotation onset). Indeed, the dPMC, and particularly the areas with only sparse projections to motoneurons, have dense connections with the PFC ( ;  ). 


### Enhanced P N  Amplitude During Relevant Idiothetic Stimulation 
  
The P N  component of the RotEP, as measured here over the vertex, had a significantly greater amplitude when the participants had to update their orientation during body rotations. This finding indicates that the amplitude of the cortical potential recorded at scalp level is a reliable marker of cognitive process enhancement related to spatial updating (including processes related to attention). This task-related effect on the P N  amplitude has found little echo, however, in the cortical current measured in the source space during the same P N  interval. This could be explained by the fact that the latter variable was obtained by averaging the cortical current over the P N  interval and that N  marked the upper bound of this interval. The differential effect of the updating task on these two EEG measurements (i.e., P N  amplitude and current in the P N  interval) might suggest that the processes specifically dedicated to space updating essentially started with a latency close to that of N , measured here as 136 ms after body rotation. Computing this latency with respect to the first cortical arrival of idiothetic cues (i.e., P : 47 ms after rotation onset), probably provides a better estimate of the latency of the updating processes. Viewed from this perspective, our EEG recordings suggest that the cortical processes specifically involved in spatial updating have a latency of ∼89 ms. 

 reported that the amplitude of the first RotEP component increases by increasing linear acceleration of the participants. In the present study, despite the angular acceleration increased with the rotation amplitude (see  ), the amplitude of P N  did not significantly differ between the different body accelerations. Although it is difficult to compare linear and angular accelerations, one can notice that the maximal linear accelerations differed more between the different translation conditions in   study (from 1 to 7.67 times greater) than the maximal angular accelerations did between the different rotation conditions of the current study (from 1 to 1.36 times greater). Hence, the absence of effect of angular acceleration on the amplitude of the RotEP could be due to the small difference of acceleration, in the present study, between the 20°, 30°, and 40° rotation amplitudes. 


### Limitations 
  
Some limitations in the present study should be considered. Having the objective that task-related cortical activities observed in the Updating task could not merely reflect motor-related processes linked to the preparation of the pointing movements produced after body rotations, we restrained our analyses to the early spatial updating processes [i.e., <470 ms (N ) with respect to the onset of body rotation]. Cortical activities involved in spatial updating that had greater latencies could therefore not be identified. Also, because the present vestibular memory-contingent task involved goal-directed arm movements, task-related activities observed here could be, in part, specific to spatial updating in contexts of motor actions, and perhaps more specifically of goal-directed arm movements. 

Another limitation concerns the statistical analyses of the cortical sources. The present experiment was designed to investigate the dynamics of the cortical activation (including from inner surfaces) during spatial updating. To enhance the spatial resolution of the brain template, we used a high number of vertices (i.e., 306,716 vertices), without correcting for multiple comparisons. Further studies could build on the present results to focus the analyses on more circumscribed regions of the cortical network shown here as being involved in spatial updating, allowing for multiple comparisons corrections. 



## Conclusion 
  
The excellent temporal resolution of the EEG recordings combined with the enhanced spatial resolution of EEG data by sources analyses allowed us to obtain insight into the dynamics of spatial updating during body motions. Within the time window of our analyses (period spanning 47–470 ms after body rotation onset), virtually all task-related cortical changes of cortical activities during spatial updating involved increased rather than decreased activations. We found that the cortical activities specifically related to spatial updating during body rotation started ∼90 ms after the first arrival of idiothetic inputs to the cortex. The spatial updating processes were largely mediated by a fronto-temporo-posterior network and implicated more regions of the right hemisphere. Among the first cortical regions showing task-related activities were those that contribute to the encoding of spatial goals and to spatial working memory processes (e.g., aPFC, dlPFC, TC). The regions showing later task-related activities are known to be involved in the visual processing and in the egocentric representation of the environment (e.g., cuneus, precuneus). Because the spatial updating processes investigated here served as a basis for planning goal-directed arm movements, in future research, it will be interesting to contrast the present results with those obtained in tasks requiring other motor outputs (e.g., saccade, locomotion) or pure cognitive estimates of object locations during or after body displacements. It will also be necessary to determine the degree to which the right-hemispheric dominance for spatial updating revealed here persists for rightward body rotations.
